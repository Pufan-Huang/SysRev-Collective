AB Companies adopt response strategies to mitigate the negative consequences of data breaches. While prior research has examined the efficacy of these strategies, it is unclear whether companies must employ the same strategy for all breaches. Given that each response strategy demands varying levels of resources, optimizing resource allocation is crucial for companies to adopt costly strategies only when necessary. Utilizing situational crisis communication theory, we investigate how stakeholders assign different levels of responsibility to companies based on the specific attributes of each data breach and assess the severity of these events. Additionally, we discuss the critical role of effective communication post-data breaches and utilize social-mediated crisis communication to examine how organizations effectively communicate with their stakeholders. We conduct a multi-method study to investigate two primary stakeholders, namely customers and investors, with respect to organizational responsibility and communication. Study 1 employs a factorial survey (n = 849) with a 2 x 2 x 2 experimental design to analyze customer behavior. For Studies 2 and 3, we collect official data breach response letters to analyze 307 data breaches from 2006 to 2022. Study 2 investigates company sales data to understand customer behavior further. In Study 3, we conduct an event study and analyze stock market data to examine investor behavior. We find that stakeholders react to data breaches based on specific characteristics that reflect the organization's responsibility and how incidents are communicated. Furthermore, customers and investors interpret the same data breaches differently. For example, locus of causality and controllability matter only to customers, and only investors turn to social media platforms (e.g., Twitter) to gather additional information about data breaches alongside company announcements. For research and practice, the findings of three studies collectively suggest a data breach-response match, highlighting the importance of situationally appropriate responses rather than always adopting costly, superior strategies (e.g., compensation). The findings also emphasize the need for companies to strategically plan their post-breach communication, as the source and form of data breach announcements affect stakeholders.

AB The tension between relevance and reliability in measurement is a critical concern for securities regulators when firms disclose non-GAAP performance measures. It also underlies many aspects of accounting standard setting, with standard setters recently giving an edge to relevance when developing new standards (e.g., fair value accounting). However, prior empirical evidence on industry-specific measures and on pro forma earnings does not provide consistent guidance as to how investors assess such tension. We investigate a novel unaudited non-GAAP performance measure, distributable cash. Distributable cash is the primary performance indicator disclosed by income trusts, a flow-through entity which became a popular investment vehicle after 2000. It purports to represent the amount of cash an income trust is capable of distributing to its investors on a sustaining basis. We find that distributable cash is deemed to be value relevant by investors, actually relegating audited GAAP earnings to a secondary role. However, distributable cash's measurement is subject to extensive managerial discretion, is unaudited, and is unverifiable by investors. In this regard, we document that reported levels of distributable cash exhibit a smoothing pattern, thus ensuring stable cash distributions to investors. We show also that managerial incentives (stock option holdings) and corporate governance (board and ownership) variables affect the level of reported distributable cash. Finally, after estimating the discretionary and nondiscretionary components of distributable cash, we find that their value relevance is similar. We infer from this finding that investors, lacking details about underlying measurement assumptions, do not seem able to see through managerial opportunism and seem to focus on distributable cash as reported. Because the valuation of income trusts, collectively worth more than $200 billion at their peak, relies significantly on distributable cash, our results suggest that unaudited non-GAAP performance measures can play an important role in capital markets. However, our results also indicate such measures need to be closely monitored by boards and regulators, thus cautioning accounting standard setters against their current emphasis value relevance over reliability.

AB Rural nanostores are the dominant source of packaged products for consumers in rural China, thus the more these stores order from reliable suppliers, the better the product quality available to rural areas. To improve merchandise circulation in rural areas, the Chinese government embarked on the large-scale "Thousands of Villages" (ToV) program in 2005. One of its key components was the implementation of an information technology (IT) procurement system to facilitate transactions between rural nanostores and the ToV program's certified consumer packaged goods (CPG) suppliers. The nanostores' adoption of the ToV procurement system was encouraged yet voluntary. We study how this system was used initially and how it evolved over time. If effective, this program has the potential to address the growing social disparity between rural and developed areas in China. We first embarked on an exploratory analysis (March 2012) to understand the ToV program from the perspectives of nanostore owners, the ToV's CPG suppliers, and the government. We then collected interview data. In Period 1 (2013-2014), when the technology was still nascent, we found that nanostore owner's trust in the ToV's CPG suppliers, and system value, played key roles for nanostore owners to use the ToV procurement system. In Period 2 (2018-2019), three contextual factors emerged-population demographic shift, improved technology infrastructure, and trust in new [non-ToV] purchasing platforms-each hindering the ToV procurement system's use. We observed strong government support during the early phases of ToV, but that support evolved from subsidizing the ToV platform and offering associated training (Period 1), to also providing credibility to competing non-ToV procurement platforms (Period 2). Collectively, the findings identify idiosyncratic challenges that arise when public policies attempt to address developing region problems by reengineering supply chains via IT. We provide implications for IT research about technology management in rural developing areas and for managers to recognize potential pitfalls of managing IT projects in supply bases unfamiliar with advanced IT.

AB Research agendas in science are fundamentally important to the generation of new knowledge and innovation. Yet, there remains a lack of scholarly attention and poor understanding on how science teams engage with research agendas in ways that influence their development. New insights are needed to better understand the factors that contribute to research agenda development and adaptation. In this paper, we draw on the framing perspective to explore how research agendas are framed in science teams over time. Research agendas can be understood as collective action frames within science teams that mobilize, guide, and coordinate the transformation of innovative but abstract science aspirations into something more concrete. Our research utilises a longitudinal case study analysis of two science teams over seven years (2016-2022). Our findings provide several new insights. First, we detail two ways in which research agendas are framed. Through centralised framing, research agendas are embodied and dictated by a visionary science team leader. In contrast, through decentralised framing, team leadership is weakly enacted and multiple team members discuss and deliberate the composition and direction of the research agenda. Second, we show centralised and decentralised approaches to framing enable and constrain the reframing and transformation of research agendas. Third, we demonstrate centralised and decentralised framing of research agendas are respectively stabilised by passive and active team learning environments across three areas: research agenda responsibility and accountability, nature of autonomy, and leadership development pathways. Finally, we theorise that, to enhance spillover, leaders who centralise framing of the research agenda need to balance between the benefits of reframing efficiency, and enabling greater team interaction and opportunities for S&T human capital development. On the other hand, when framing of research agendas is decentralised, team leaders need to balance between the benefits of team collaboration and leader development, and path dependent decision making. These insights lead to propositions that offer implications for theory and practice.

AB From a simple idea to unite asset owners in their quest for responsible investment (RI) at its launch in April 2006, the United Nations supported Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI) have grown in just one decade into an initiative with more than 1500 fee-paying signatories. Jointly, the PRI's signatories hold assets worth more than $80 trillion, making it one of the more prevalent not-for-profit organizations worldwide. Furthermore, the PRI's ambitious mission to transform the financial system at large into a more sustainable one makes it a worthwhile subject of inquiry from an institutional perspective. We undertake an empirical investigation of the adoption of the PRI by asset owners during five crucial years of the association's emergence: 2007-2011. Following a tripartite view of institutional theory proposed by Scott (Institutions and organizations. Foundations for organizational science, A Sage Publication Series, London, 1995), we explore if regulative, normative, and cultural-cognitive factors influence an asset owner's decision to subscribe to the PRI. Applying both parametric and non-parametric survival analysis, we find that asset owners are indeed significantly affected by normative, cultural-cognitive, and regulative aspects. In particular, (i) public service employee and labor union pension funds (ii) from social backgrounds more culturally aligned with values represented by the RI movement (iii) with historically more voluntary legislation on environmental, social, and governance (ESG) issues are most likely to sign the PRI. In contrast, institutional environments with a higher number of pre-existing mandatory ESG regulation decrease the likelihood of signing the PRI. Our results indicate that normative and cultural-cognitive factors were crucial contributors to the PRI's growth. With respect to the regulative environments, our results imply that some asset owners may use the PRI as a collective industry initiative to substitute for mandatory legislation. Conversely, a high level of historical mandatory legislation may constrain organizational resources that could otherwise be dedicated to voluntary initiatives such as PRI. Our findings are robust to relevant controls and econometric concerns.

AB The purpose of stakeholder management is to facilitate our understanding of increasingly unpredictable external environments, thereby facilitating our ability to manage within these environments. We argue that a powerful implicit assumption within the stakeholder literature-that priorities within role-based stakeholder groups are relatively homogeneous-blurs our understanding of organization-stakeholder relationships. Two important and related areas of concern are presented. The first involves the primacy of role in stakeholder definition. This role primacy approach to stakeholder definition is appropriate if, for a particular issue, role-based stakeholder group members have similar priorities. Individual and collective self-interest provides a rationale for this assumption. However, an important problem with this approach arises in situations in which self-interest is not the primary motivator of individuals' priorities. In these instances, subgroups within different role-based stakeholder group, might have more similar priorities than either subgroup has with others within their role-based stakeholder group. In these situations the role primacy approach impedes, rather than facilitates, an understanding of our environment. Our second concern is related to insufficient rigor in the application of stakeholder analysis. Most stakeholder studies, both theoretical and empirical, fall short in the determination of relevant interests and the subsequent subdivision of role-based stakeholder groups into rigorously defined specific stakeholder groups. Having suggested that the role primacy approach to stakeholder definition is less than ideal, we examine the extent to which, and the conditions under which, roles are likely to determine priorities, and thus, the likelihood of relatively homogeneous priorities within role-based stakeholder groups. In addition, we present an illustrative empirical analysis of stakeholder group priorities. The illustrative study is conducted within the context of intercollegiate athletics. Related literature and our empirical results indicate that role-based self-interest frequently is not a sufficient "binding tie" of stakeholder groups. Given this background, we present an alternative approach to stakeholder analysis that borrows heavily from the customer segmentation literature of marketing. Our alternative approach can accommodate heterogeneous priorities within role-based stakeholder group,.

TI Knowledge creation in professional service firms: Institutional effects
SO ORGANIZATION STUDIES
LA English
DT Article
DE knowledge creation; consultancy; institutional influences; identity
ID SOCIAL IDENTITY; INNOVATION; WORK
AB This article presents an analysis of institutional influences upon knowledge creation within professional service firms, whose main business is the provision of specialized consultancy. Such firms, we argue, provide an important setting for examining such influences because their survival depends on their ability to mobilize and synthesize professional bodies of knowledge. They, therefore, directly confront the constraints that institutionalized professions pose for processes of knowledge creation. By exploring the influence of the institutional context, the article extends earlier work on professional service and knowledge-intensive firms which has tended to adopt a more micro, organizational-level focus on knowledge creation and to neglect both the heterogeneous nature of knowledge and its embeddedness in institutional contexts.
   A comparative analysis of two firms located in different institutional contexts (science and the law) establishes some of the major mechanisms through which professional institutions influence knowledge-creation processes. Specifically, the analysis highlights three major arenas, related to the processes of knowledge creation within organizations, in which institutional influences are seen to operate. These are: the relative work autonomy of professional groups; the means of knowledge legitimation; and the social identity formation of professional practitioners. While institutional influences were found in these different arenas across both cases, significant differences in knowledge-creating practices were also observed. These include different emphases on experimentation versus interpretation, different forms of personal networking, and significant differences in the relative importance of codifying knowledge in documentary forms. These differences are explained in terms of institutionally embedded means of legitimating knowledge across scientific and legal contexts.
   In observing institutional influences on micro work practices, however, our study also highlights the role and influence of management. Specifically, in the arena of social identity, managers sought to accommodate professional norms through firm-specific arrangements, which shaped and mobilized a social identity geared toward corporate ends. Management effort thus focused on developing a collective identity, based on elitism, which was used as a means of leveraging individual creativity and expertise as an organizational resource.

AB Many of today's software systems are created by leveraging ecosystems consisting of heterogeneous "complementors" and "hub" firms. In fact, the reliance on ecosystems is prevalent in the enterprise resource planning (ERP) domain, where larger ERP vendors form collaborative relationships with smaller industry-specific vendors to co-create value for themselves and their customers. However, value creation and destruction processes are often intertwined. A key motivation for this study is to shed light on the behavioral contingencies and underlying mechanisms that might lead to value destruction over time instead of the initially intended value co-creation. Furthermore, although value co-creation in collaborative relationships associated with ecosystems is often highlighted, research has been scarce on offering an in-depth analysis of the challenges in these relationships that can destroy value. This study attempts to address this issue by uncovering the underlying mechanisms that lead a hub firm and its complementors toward value destruction. Our mixed-methods approach involves the use of a combination of interpretive case study and analytical modeling to highlight nuances and develop conceptual propositions about the conditions that can potentially lead to value destruction. Our context is a globally reputed information technology (IT) firmknown for providing business solutions (SOFTCo, a pseudonym) and numerous relatively small, less powerful customer-facing service firms (PartnerCos, a pseudonym). Our findings show that opportunism, unjust appropriation of rents, shirking, exploitation of asymmetric power, and undue dependence can initiate a value destruction process. Furthermore, our study revealed an unexpected emergence of a "pack of wolves," where resentful PartnerCos formed a collective to tackle the opportunistic behaviors of SOFTCo by starting to align with its competitor, further destroying value for SOFTCo's ecosystem. Overall, this study contributes to the literature on value co-creation/destruction in IT ecosystems. It also offers an illustration of a mixed-methods study where seemingly incommensurable approaches are harnessed to develop a theoretical understanding.

AB We investigate inventory ordering decisions when decision makers anticipated a demand shock. Decision makers anticipating an event have been shown to brace for an uncertain negative outcome by overestimating the likelihood of that event. Decision makers faced with a spike in demand may incur increased holding costs because they may brace, exhibiting a judgment bias, and consequently a decision bias by over-ordering inventory. Three studies span conditions of uncertainty regarding the timing and magnitude of a demand shock: Employing three between-subjects experiments, Study 1 investigates behavior when decision makers were faced with uncertainty in timing and in magnitude of demand at the most elemental level, manipulating holding and stock out costs. The three experimental tasks feature uncertainty about the magnitude of demand (Experiment 1.1), uncertainty about the timing of demand (Experiment 1.2), and uncertainty about both the magnitude and timing of demand (Experiment 1.3). Study 2 uses a dynamic, multi-period replenishment task and a between-subjects manipulation regarding the uncertainty of timing and magnitude of a demand shock. Study 3 also employs a multi-period decision environment, but compares behavior under a demand shock condition with that in a condition featuring only random variability. The collective results from the three studies identify a bias toward over-ordering in response to a demand shock, relative to the optimal orders. The between-subjects manipulations in Study 2 points toward a possible remedy as we found that providing information concerning the timing and magnitude of a shock ameliorated the bias. The primary revelation was that decision makers had more difficulty dealing with uncertain timing than with uncertain magnitude of demand. One implication is that it is particularly critical for retailers to carefully plan and manage how they share information with upstream supply chain partners regarding when they plan to introduce store-level promotions.

AB One can identify compelling reasons for private and public organizations to embrace participative systems. Scholars and organizational consultants maintain that organizations need such systems to prosper in an increasingly competitive and turbulent world, and that such changes are now taking place. Yet, participative techniques have diffused minimally. Why is there such a discrepancy between the endorsements and adoption of participative methods, despite the strong arguments for them and their intuitive appeal?
   This paper maintains that barriers to participative systems are embedded in social, economic, and political principles deeply valued in their own right. Writings on participative systems treat these barriers as difficult problems that can be overcome through patient, well-designed behavioral and organizational interventions. In contrast, we suggest that the structures and attitudes impeding participative systems are usually valued more highly than the prospective gains from the systems, and that, in the future, true participative systems will have difficulty sustaining themselves in an organizational landscape that continues to favor systems of centralized control. Similar impediments operating in areas as different as management and government regulation suggest basic processes that rise above specific contexts.
   The paper draws on two pertinent but heretofore disconnected scholarly literatures-the literatures on cooperation and on collaboration-to analyze the experiences with participative systems in management and regulatory policy. Four themes-prior dispositions toward cooperation, social and political organization, the nature of purposes, issues, and values, and leadership capacity and style-are critical to understanding each area. Generally, participative systems bump into problems of collective action: dispositions against cooperating with prior adversaries, the costs of collaboration in complex social and political systems, the difficulties of engaging deep conflicts, and leadership incentives favoring control that develop in this context. These conditions repeatedly undermine incipient, fragile participative systems. The study of participation would benefit from closer attention to how social, economic, and political structures constrain or facilitate such systems, and more extensive links among the various literatures on the subject.

AB Pasteur's Quadrant model, published by Stokes in 1997, presents a two-dimensional abstract conceptual framework that proved immensely helpful to study and discuss institutional and policy arrangements in science. However, during the last 10 years the PQ model was also applied in a series of large-scale, survey-based studies worldwide to classify individual modern-day researchers according to their research orientation and performance.
   This paper argues that such applications are inadequate to capture key characteristics of individual researchers, especially those within the heterogeneous 'Pasteur type' group who engage in 'use-inspired' basic scientific research. Addressing this shortcoming, Pasteur's Cube (PC) model introduces a new heuristic tool. Departing from a three-dimensional conceptual framework of research-related activities, the model enables a range of typologies to describe and study the large variety of academics at today's research-intensive universities. The PC model's analytical robustness was tested empirically in two interrelated 'proof of concept' studies: an exploratory survey among 150 European universities and a follow-up case study of Leiden University in the Netherlands. Both studies, collecting data for the years 2010-2015, applied a metrics-based taxonomy to classify individual academic researchers according to four performance categories: scientific publication output, research collaboration with the business sector, patents filings, and being engaging in entrepreneurial activities.
   The collective results of both studies provide more clarity on relevant subgroups of use-inspired researchers. The PC model can be used to guide empirical, metrics-based investigations of research activities and productivities, applies this approach to two case studies, and demonstrates the utility of the method while also reinforcing and enriching the growing body of literature showing that cross-sectoral and cross-functional research activities are more scientifically productive than research carried out in isolation of the context of use. Introducing the 'Crossover Collaborator' subtype helps to explain why Pasteur type researchers tend to outperform other types of researchers in terms of publication output and citation impact.

TI DOING VERSUS SEEING: ACTS OF EXPLOITATION AND PERCEPTIONS OF EXPLORATION
SO STRATEGIC ENTREPRENEURSHIP JOURNAL

DE exploration; exploitation; search; innovation
ID MODEL
AB The challenge of organizational adaptation is often presented in terms of the tension between the exploration of new possibilities and the exploitation of existing accomplishments. Whether framed in the language of invention versus refinement or local search versus long jumps, the spirit of the argument is of an explicit trade-off that resource-constrained organizations must make to secure their survival and success. While we do not dispute the fundamental truth that underlies this tension, we do believe this dominant characterization of the process of exploration may be masking key drivers of this tension and potential paths towards its resolution. We argue that, from the perspective of an actor, all activities are inherently exploitative in their nature, in the sense that they are undertaken with the explicit expectation that they may achieve meaningful progress on some dimension of performance. The key distinction regards the extent to which the dimension of performance is recognized and legitimated from the perspective of the organizational context in which the actor is operating. Acts perceived as 'exploratory' are, thus, more accurately characterized as acts of exploitation directed along new performance dimensions. We consider the organizational challenges that such exploratory action poses and the implications for entrepreneurial initiatives. From the perspective of the focal actor engaged in the exploratory initiative, the challenge is to identify 'projections' of the payoff of the initiative they are pursuing, either onto those dimensions of performance that are of interest to the organization, or onto more concrete measures of product-market acceptance and financial return. Low-dimensional representations of the business landscape are an inevitable by-product of bounded rationality and the need for organizations and their strategies to coordinate and direct collective action. In this regard, the most powerful form of entrepreneurship may be the initiation of the cognitive shifts that offer a different topology of the competitive landscape.

AB The existing literature has long assumed that unethical behaviors are fueled by competition. Under this premise, rivalry and competition are often treated interchangeably. This study seeks to challenge this prevailing notion by introducing a conceptual distinction between rivalry and competition. Specifically, we explore the multifaceted relationship between rivalry and unethical behaviors in the context of online review self-injecting behaviors. Drawing on the collective regulatory focus framework and deterrence theory, we posit that rivalry-induced deterrence triggers a shift in mindset from promotion focus to prevention focus, which leads to the formation of mutual forbearance in self-injecting behaviors. Mutual forbearance collapses when one party unilaterally engages in self-injection, prompting the other party to retaliate by increasing their self-injecting activities. Additionally, we propose that firm reputation plays a crucial role in reinforcing the formation of mutual forbearance while mitigating its collapse. Employing an exhaustive data set from Ctrip.com and Qunar.com that comprises 85,939 observations from 3,996 hotels and spans 2018-2020, we found that the presence of an additional rival leads to a 3.2% decrease in self-injecting intensity. Furthermore, self-injecting intensity increases by 0.095% for every 1% rise in that of the rivals and increases by 0.041% for a 1% rise in that of the nonrival competitors. Crucially, our study identifies that firm reputation acts as a significant factor that strengthens the negative relationship between the number of rivals and self-injecting intensity and weakens the positive relationship between a hotel's self-injecting and its rival's self-injecting intensity. These empirical findings are supported by a myriad of robust examinations, including the use of a set of subsample analyses, alternative measures of independent variables, alternative instrumental variables, alternative observation time windows, and multiple endogeneity tests. This study contributes to the literature by highlighting the pervasive and potent role of rivalry as an understudied inhibitor of self-injecting behaviors. Our empirical evidence offers critical managerial implications for platforms, sellers, and consumers.

SO SLOAN MANAGEMENT REVIEW
LA English
DT Article
AB When faced with a global IT infrastructure transition project, Xerox managers decided to launch a knowledge-sharing initiative called the Transition Alliance. When fully functional, the Alliance comprised fifty If professionals responsible for managing 70,000 desktop workstations, nearly 1,200 servers, and networking hardware on five continents. Storck and Hili observed that community members provided high-quality, validated solutions, handled unstructured problems well, and dealt effectively with new developments in hardware and software. The authors also point out that the motivation for learning and developing at an individual level seemed greater in this community structure than in other organizational forms, which has important implications for the longer-term job performance of the participants.
   The Alliance was more than simply a group that mel occasionally to discuss common issues related to a single functional or professional area, it had a defined relationship to formal organizational objectives yet was not formally required to report back to headquarters on its activities. Within the Alliance, the communication repertoire was built upon the leadership training required for all Xerox employees. Work processes that developed within the Alliance supplemented those used elsewhere in the organization. Handling action items, creating meeting agendas, and developing other processes were evidence of the self-directed nature of the group and provided a context for communication.
   Storck and Hill identified six guiding principles that were instrumental to Alliance success and are applicable whenever circumstances require organizational learning:
   Design an interaction format that promotes openness and allows for serendipity.
   Build upon a common organizational culture.
   Demonstrate the existence of mutual interests after the initial success at resolving issues and achieving corporate goals.
   Leverage those aspects of the organizational culture that respect the value of collective learning.
   Embed knowledge-sharing practices into the work precesses of the group.
   Establish an environment in which knowledge sharing is based on processes and cultural norms that are defined by the community rather than other parts of the organization.

SO HARVARD BUSINESS REVIEW
LA English
DT Article
AB When disaster strikes, many corporations respond generously. After the 2004 tsunami, for instance, U.S. firms alone contributed more than half a billion dollars in cash and in-kind donations. But a host of reactive efforts don't produce the best results-and may even get in the way.
   To make the most of their humanitarian efforts, companies need to address two fundamental questions: What kind of aid do we want to contribute-philanthropic (money and in-kind don ations) or integrative (backroom, operational assistance)? And how do we want to contribute it-by working one-on-one with a single agency or by joining a consortium? The permutations of those two decisions lead to four different approaches, each with its own strengths and challenges.
   Single-company philanthropic partnerships work well when there's a good match between what a company wants to contribute and what an agency needs, as with Coca-Cola's donations of water to the Red Cross. More diffuse, but also potentially more effective, a re the benefits of joining a multicompany philanthropic partnership, which enables the resources of many firms to be matched to the missions of many agencies. More difficult to establish but more fundamental in its impact is a single-company integrative partnership, in which a corporation works to improve the way an aid agency operates, as the logistics giant TNT has done to help the distribution efforts of the World Food Programme. And most difficult to implement-but potentially most effective-is a multicompany integrative partnership, which brings to bear the collective best practices of many companies to improve the response capabilities of multiple agencies.
   Ifs easy to see why the image of a relief worker carrying a sack of grain delivers an emotional wallop, but the behind-the-scenes work of process enhancement is just as crucial to humanitarian efforts. The sooner executives realize this, the better positioned the world will be to respond to global disasters.

AB In this research, we disentangle the relationship between several key aspects of a team leader's experience and the likelihood of improvement project success. Using the lens of socio-technical systems, we argue that the effect of team leader experience derives from the social system as well as the technical system. The aspects of team leader experience we examine include team leader social capital (a part of the social system) and team leader experience leading projects of the same type (a part of the technical system).
   We examine four different, yet related, dimensions of a team leader's social capital, which we motivate based on the social networks literature. One dimension, team leader familiarity, suggests that social capital is created when team leaders have experience working with current team members on prior improvement projects, and that such social capital increases the likelihood of improvement project success. We develop three additional dimensions, using social network analysis (SNA), to capture the idea that the improvement team leader's social capital extends beyond the current team to include everyone the leader has previously worked with on improvement projects. Contrasting our SNA-based dimensions with team leader familiarity enables us to better understand the impact of a team leader's social capital both inside and beyond the team. We also examine the effect of a team leader's experience leading prior projects of the same type, and consider the extent to which organizational experience may moderate the impact of both team leader social capital and same-type project experience.
   Based on analysis of archival data of six sigma projects spanning six years from a Fortune 500 consumer products manufacturer, we find that two of our SNA-based dimensions of team leader social capital, as well as experience leading projects of the same type, increase the likelihood of project success. In addition, we show that organizational experience moderates the relationship between team leader same-type project experience and project success. However, this is not the case for the relationship between the dimensions of team leader social capital and project success. These results provide insights regarding how dimensions of team leader experience and organizational experience collectively impact the operational performance of improvement teams.

AB Many online labor platforms employ reputation systems and monitoring systems to mitigate moral hazard. Whereas reputation systems have the potential to reduce moral hazard, they suffer from the cold -start problem, in which new entrants without an established reputation face a high entry barrier as employers predominantly select workers based on their existing reputation. Monitoring systems, providing employers with direct oversight of workers' actions, offer a different approach. By tracking and reporting workers' effort levels, monitoring systems reduce ex post information asymmetry and, thus, lower employers' expected moral hazard risk from workers. However, unlike reputation systems, monitoring systems do not directly address ex ante information asymmetry, failing to assist employers in identifying the right workers. This inherent limitation raises questions about their effectiveness in resolving the cold -start problem. In this paper, we first propose a stylized theoretical model that characterizes worker entry in the presence of reputation and monitoring systems. Based on a unique data set from a leading online labor platform, we then empirically investigate the effect of monitoring systems on the entry barriers by examining the change in workers' entry behaviors after the introduction of the monitoring system along with associated project outcomes, which include employers' hiring preferences, hiring prices, and project performance. We exploit the differential availability of the monitoring system across two project types: time -based projects, for which the monitoring system is accessible, and fixed -price projects, for which it is not. Employing a difference -in -differences estimation with a sample including 9,344 fixed -price projects and 3,118 time -based projects, we report that the introduction of the monitoring system increases the number of bids on time -based projects by 27.8%, and the incremental bids predominantly originate from inexperienced workers who lack platform reputation. We further find that, following the introduction of the monitoring system, employers' preference for experienced workers diminishes, accompanied by an average reduction of 19.5% in labor costs, whereas we observe no significant decrease in project completion and review rating. Our results collectively suggest that monitoring systems alleviate the cold -start problem in online platforms.

TI NEW BUSINESS ENTREPRENEURSHIP IN THE JAPANESE ECONOMY
SO JOURNAL OF BUSINESS VENTURING
LA English
DT Article
AB This article presents the results of a study focused on the role of new business entrepreneurship in the Japanese economy. Particular attention is paid to the activities of various government agencies in relation to new business entrepreneurship and to the barriers to this activity in Japan. New business entrepreneurship was defined as the formation and rapid growth of a business enterprise through unique approaches to the firm's activities.
   In contrast to the American stereotype of Japan as an economy of a few large, interconnected firms, it is, in fact, characterized by small- and medium-sized enterprises. Over 99% of all Japanese enterprises are categorized as small or medium and over 80% of all employed Japanese are employed by such firms. However, very few of these firms are entrepreneurial in nature. The vast majority are small firms that are either subcontractors to a single larger firm or small retail, wholesale, or restaurant establishments.
   The start-up rate for all types of businesses in Japan has been declining for the past 10 to 15 years. More importantly, the rate of start-ups for independent firms, as opposed to firms started by a larger firm to serve primarily as a subcontractor, declined even more sharply. This indicates a significant weakness in Japan's otherwise strong economy.
   The low and declining rate of new business entrepreneurship in Japan is a function of structural, governmental, and cultural barriers. Structural barriers include an acute, long-term labor shortage, high financial start-up costs due in large part to high land prices, and a shortage of venture capital funding. Government barriers include ''red tape, '' financial and other support for small firms that is withdrawn as they enter rapid growth, and the persistent protection of inefficient industry structures. Cultural barriers involve Japan's strong group/collective orientation, the traditional career path in Japan, bounds on creativity, and the fact that entrepreneurship is not assigned a high social value.
   While the government provides an extensive, well-developed network of services for small- and medium-sized firms, these programs are not designed to facilitate rapid growth into the large firm phase. The Japanese experiences and programs offer useful insights for policy and tactics by other governments.

AB The use of digital contact tracing (DCT) during the COVID-19 pandemic serves as a prime example of how government agencies and public authorities are leveraging information technologies to address complex societal challenges. However, during the period in which the study was conducted, the rate of voluntary adoption of DCT among individuals in the United States proved to be both low and uneven, falling short of the critical mass required for effective containment of viral transmission. Despite previous research suggesting that individuals' willingness to use DCT is primarily driven by their perceived benefits and privacy concerns, and that DCT awareness could help individuals make more informed adoption decisions, the factors contributing to the mixed perceptions of DCT remain unexplored. Drawing on cultural cognition theory, we propose that individuals' perceptions of risks, specifically privacy concerns in our context, and perceptions of benefits regarding DCT can be influenced by their cultural worldviews. Furthermore, the influence of DCT awareness on individuals' perceptions of DCT is moderated by their cultural worldviews. This occurs because individuals tend to seek out and interpret information in a manner consistent with their existing worldviews. Based on a survey of 1,014 U.S. residents, our study demonstrates that cultural worldviews characterized by two dimensions, group, emphasizing collective responsibility in addressing personal needs, and grid, focusing on behavioral regulation based on values and attitudes pertaining to social hierarchies and established norms, significantly affect both perceived benefits and privacy concerns related to DCT. These perceptions, in turn, impact individuals' intention to use DCT. Furthermore, individuals with a high-group worldview or a low-grid worldview exhibit a stronger positive association between DCT awareness and perceived benefits, and a stronger negative association between DCT awareness and privacy concerns. Our findings further reveal that cultural worldviews not only influence individuals' biases in selecting media outlets for technological information but also shape their risk-benefit assessment of other emerging technologies designed to tackle societal issues. In summary, this study highlights the pivotal role that cultural worldviews play in understanding public support for information technologies aimed at addressing complex societal challenges.

TI Channel Strategies for Durable Goods: Coexistence of Selling and Leasing
   to Individual and Corporate Consumers

   theory; market segmentation
AB In durable goods markets, such as those for automobiles or computers, the coexistence of selling and leasing is common as is the existence of both corporate and individual consumers. Leases to corporate consumers affect the price of used goods on the second-hand market which in turn affect the buying and leasing behavior of individual consumers. The setting of prices (or volumes) for sale and lease to individual and corporate consumers is a complicated problem for manufacturers. We consider a manufacturer who concurrently sells and leases a finitely durable good to both individual and corporate consumers. The interaction between the manufacturer and consumers is modeled as a dynamic sequential game, where each player seeks to maximize its own payoff over an infinite horizon. We study how the corporate channel substitutability of new goods and used goods and transaction costs in the second-hand market affect the manufacturer's pricing decisions, consumer behavior, and social welfare in the retail market. Making a number of simplifying assumptions, including two-period lifetime for the finitely durable goods, we consider Markov Perfect Equilibrium as the solution concept. We show that the manufacturer can maximize her profit by segmenting consumers according to their willingness to pay. Selling and leasing are the mechanisms used for price discrimination in the retail market. We show that as she leases a larger share of her production to the corporate consumer, (1) the manufacturer does not necessarily have to adjust the optimal selling price of new goods to individual consumers, and the volume of sales of new goods to individual consumers can stay the same; (2) the manufacturer does increase the retail lease price, and the number of individual leases decreases; (3) the net supply of used goods on the market increases, leading to a lower market price for used goods; and (4) more individual consumers are able to participate in the market, and their collective welfare or net utility improves. We also show that as production costs increase the manufacturer increases prices, reducing volumes across all channels. When transaction costs increase, the manufacturer reduces leasing in both corporate and retail channels.

AB This paper positions effectuation as a network-driving and network dependent phenomenon and suggests that understanding networks and network processes is essential to understanding the dynamics of effectuation. We argue that the implementation of effectuation is influenced by the nodal, relational, and structural characteristics of pre-existing and emerging networks, and by the processes through which these networks come about. We use these arguments to develop a multilevel, multi-theoretical reconceptualization of effectuation that provides for distributed agency and collective cognition of network members. We allow for the simultaneous and interactional use of effectual and causal logics, as well as the co-construction of knowledge, identity, and social capital within and across network levels. Our model also addresses changing uncertainty as opportunities develop, nuances of effectual interactions, and evolving market dynamics. Our propositions and reflections offer directions for further studies at the intersection of network and effectuation research.
   Executive summary: There is little doubt that effectuation is reshaping how we think about entrepreneurial cognition and behavior. A core argument is that under conditions of uncertainty, entrepreneurs can co-create opportunities by collaborating with other willful agents. This moves us away from classical views of entrepreneurship and positions effectuation as a network-driving and network-dependent phenomenon. Yet, recent debate highlights that effectuation research has paid insufficient attention to the network of external parties involved. As a result, although the extant model of effectuation recognizes the importance of networks, our understanding of the relationship between effectual logic and entrepreneurial networks is far from complete.
   Several theoretically important and practically relevant questions arise from this knowledge gap. For example if we think about network development, how are potential stakeholders brought to mind and persuaded to commit if end-points and stakeholder preferences are both unknowable? What are the characteristics (i.e. structure, content and governance) of the networks that emerge through these commitments? Reciprocally, how do the characteristics of the emerging network influence effectual processes and outcomes?
   In this paper, we begin to address this line of questioning by considering effectuation not only at the level of the individual but also through lenses reflective of the three levels of analysis commonly adopted in network research: i) dyadic relationships, ii) the entrepreneurial network, and iii) the market more generally. While we attend to pre-existing networks (the constitution of which is likely to affect the probability of adopting effectual logic), our focus is on linking the individual and emerging networks across these levels.
   At the level of the individual, we break from prior effectuation research and ascribe new and influential roles to entrepreneurial ideas and instrumental mindsets in focusing an entrepreneur's attention on particular relationships (i.e. the cognitive activation of a cohesive network involving interested and persuadable individuals). At the level of the dyad, we suggest the very nature of interactions between actors can influence individual choice of logic. We specify that stakeholders will expect signs of process legitimacy (e.g. cognitive flexibility on the part of the entrepreneur) before making effectual commitments. We also move away from assumptions about altruistic behavior to suggest that power and influence will accrue to stakeholders whose resources are at risk and/or perceived by others to resolve uncertainty. At the level of the entrepreneurial network, we link effectuation to a brokerage orientation (tertius iungens) that enhances inclusiveness surrounding means and collective cognition. Moreover, we move beyond the narrow view of facilitating and constraining factors portrayed in the effectuation literature to argue that (e.g.) i) with respect to network content, resource specificity will shape possible futures; ii) with respect to governance, trust, supported by social mechanisms will predominate; and, iii) with respect to structure, specific network characteristics will be more supportive of certain aspects of effectuation than others (e.g. cohesive networks are more supportive of collaboration, but may limit the flexibility needed to embrace contingencies). At the market level, we posit that on the one hand, institutions will shape effectual processes. On the other hand, effectual processes are more likely than causal processes to create new institutions and/or supplant existing institutions.
   Overall, our study contributes to the understanding of both effectuation and networks by offering a multi-level, multi-theoretical re-conceptualization of the dynamics of effectuation. Our arguments should spur research in at least three interdependent areas: i) uncertainty and individual cognition; ii) network processes surrounding interactions and commitments; and iii) the contingent effects of network characteristics on effectuation. For practitioners, our insights should help shape thoughts about i) who to interact with in the face of uncertainty; ii) what stories to tell and how to deal with image management; iii) what to expect during negotiations; iv) how to broker relationships to enhance the 'co' in 'co-creation'; and moreover, v) what network characteristics might facilitate or constrain their efforts.

ID COORDINATION
AB This paper determines categories of contracts that facilitate vertical information sharing in a supply chain while precluding horizontal information leakage among competing newsvendors. We consider a supply chain in which retailers replenish inventory from a common supplier to satisfy uncertain demand and are engaged in newsvendor competition. Each retailer has imperfect demand information. Yet one of the retailers (the incumbent) has a more accurate demand forecast than the other (the entrant). Information leakage among such competing retailers precludes vertical information sharing and is often the reason for many retailers to abandon collaborative forecast-sharing initiatives, leading to suboptimized supply chains. We show that whether a contract can prevent information leakage depends on how the inventory risk (i.e., cost of supply-demand mismatch) is allocated among the supplier and retailers in conjunction with the allocation of profits. We categorize contracts according to how they allocate inventory risk among firms when compared with a wholesale-price contract. This comparison yields four mutually exdusive and collectively exhaustive categories of contracts. A downside-protection contract is one that effectively reduces retailers' cost of excess inventory by shifting some of their overage cost to the supplier. Examples of such contracts include buy-back and revenue-sharing contracts. An upside-protection contract is one that effectively increases retailers' cost of inventory shortage by shifting some of the supplier's underage cost to retailers. Examples of such contracts include penalty and rebate contracts. A two-sided protection contract combines the properties of the previous two categories. A no-protection contract is one that fails to shift firms' cost of inventory shortage or excess from one to the other. Examples of such contracts include wholesale-price and two-part tariff contracts. We show that no-protection contracts, which are extensively used in practice, cannot prevent information leakage, whereas others may do so. We also show that preventing information leakage could be costly for the supply chain (i.e., low channel efficiency). We conclude by illustrating how our unified framework to study a variety of contracts can enable a firm to determine the best-performing contract (among many) that precludes information leakage while almost coordinating the channel. For example, we show why buy-back contracts perform significantly better than revenue-sharing or rebate contracts.

AB Motivated by ongoing dialog at the national level on racial (in)equality, we examine the relations be-tween audit partner ethnicity (audit partners of Asian, Black, or Hispanic origin) and three salient audit phenomena. Specifically, we examine whether there is a difference in financial reporting quality between the clients of ethnic minority audit partners (EMAPs, hereafter) and those of White partners, whether EMAPs face a different work environment than their White counterparts, and how EMAPs are treated in the audit firm. We find that clients of EMAPs, on average, have earnings that are more predictive of future cash fiows, have smaller unsigned discretionary accruals, and are less likely to receive a comment letter from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission than clients of White partners. We also find weak evidence that clients of EMAPs have more persistent earnings, lower signed discretionary accruals, and higher audit fees. We do not find evidence of differences in restatement likelihood between the clients of EMAPs and those of White partners. Overall, these results provide some evidence that clients of EMAPs have higher financial reporting quality. Next, we find that, compared to White partners, EMAPs are more likely to work in offices that are smaller, earn lower audit fees, are non-Big 4, and have no prestigious clients. Finally, we find that EMAPs are more likely to be in charge of engagements with clients whose top management (but not whose audit committee) has ethnic representation. We find no evidence that EMAPs are less likely to be engaged with prestigious or important clients. However, we find that, following a financial restatement, EMAPs are more likely than White audit partners to be replaced. Collectively, our findings suggest that even though EMAPs 1) tend to work in less desirable offices, 2) have a client alignment that is affected by ethnic representation in the client's top management, 3) face more severe consequences after audit failure, they are associated with some properties of higher audit quality. This study is one of the first to broadly examine important aspects of the work of EMAPs. We believe that our findings will be of interest to audit firms, audit clients, other related parties, and society at large, especially given audit firms' efforts to improve ethnic diversity.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The IASB asserts that global stakeholder participation in the standard-setting process is critical for developing and maintaining high-quality accounting standards. However, the myriad languages used in countries that apply IFRS may impede this participation. We find that the IASB is less likely to receive comment letters from stakeholders in countries with languages that are linguistically distant from English. We also find that comment letters from more linguistically distant stakeholders are less likely to be quoted in IASB staff-prepared comment letter summaries, suggesting that they have less influence in the redeliberation process. Path analyses show that this result arises from language frictions being associated with reduced writing quality and originality. We also find that language frictions prevent participation in other standard-setting communication channels. Collectively, language frictions appear to impede the IASB's efforts to equitably obtain and consider valuable global feedback.
   << Pas de commentaire >> : les barri & egrave;res linguistiques et la proc & eacute;dure d'approbation du CNCISelon le CNCI, il est essentiel que les parties prenantes du monde entier participent au processus de normalisation pour & eacute;laborer et respecter des normes comptables de haute qualit & eacute;. Toutefois, la diversit & eacute; des langues utilis & eacute;es dans les pays qui appliquent les IFRS peut limiter cette participation. Les auteurs constatent que le CNCI est moins susceptible de recevoir des lettres de commentaires des parties prenantes dans les pays dont les langues sont linguistiquement moins proches de l'anglais. Ils observent & eacute;galement que les lettres de commentaires de ces parties prenantes sont moins susceptibles d'& ecirc;tre cit & eacute;es dans les r & eacute;sum & eacute;s des lettres de commentaires pr & eacute;par & eacute;s par le personnel du CNCI, sugg & eacute;rant ainsi qu'elles ont moins d'influence sur le processus de d & eacute;lib & eacute;ration. Les analyses de chemin r & eacute;v & egrave;lent que ce r & eacute;sultat est d & ucirc; & agrave; une diminution de la qualit & eacute; et de l'originalit & eacute; du travail d'& eacute;criture en raison des barri & egrave;res linguistiques. Par ailleurs, il en ressort que les barri & egrave;res linguistiques limitent l'utilisation d'autres canaux de communication destin & eacute;s & agrave; la normalisation. En somme, les barri & egrave;res linguistiques semblent entraver les efforts d & eacute;ploy & eacute;s par le CNCI pour obtenir et prendre en compte de mani & egrave;re & eacute;quitable des commentaires utiles au niveau mondial.

TI The evolution of intracorporate domains: Divisional charter losses in
   high-technology, multidivisional corporations

ID PERFORMANCE; STRATEGIES
AB Modern corporations have become synonymous with the multidivisional form of organization. Variously interdependent divisions are ''chartered'' to look after one or more business areas, in effect defining the ''turf'' of the division and its purpose within the corporation, and collectively defining the corporate domain. However, once created, these divisional charters should not be regarded as rigid; they are susceptible to change. Particularly in fast-paced environments, such as in high-technology industries, divisional charters are liable to change as divisions add or subtract businesses to their charter responsibilities. These charter changes are seen as an adaptive device for large, multidivisional corporations in fast-paced environments.
   This paper presents a process model of how divisions change their domains in hypercompetitive contexts, focusing on the specific question of how divisions lose all or portions of their business charters. The paper is based on a larger inductive study of charter changes in ten divisions, both domestic and foreign, of a large, multinational, high-technology corporation. Data were collected over an 18-month period and included formal interviews, questionnaires, company documents, group interviews, media publications and direct observations of strategy formation sessions. Over 80 informants were interviewed across several managerial levels.
   Our data revealed three distinct patterns and logics of charter loss depending upon what phase of core business development a division found itself: (1) Divisions starting-up new core businesses lost these charters because of a combination of their failure in the new area and competition with other divisions in the company-the process revealed a competitive market for new charters; (2) Divisions rapidly growing new core businesses lost peripheral business areas in order to focus on the core business-the process emphasized a focus logic for charter change; finally (3) Divisions with mature charter areas were found to shed their core business areas because of an emerging misfit between their skills and culture and the nature of competition in the industry-the process emphasized the emerging nature of corporate misalignment and the abrupt charter changes that can follow. This paper contributes to organizational theory by exploring the evolution of large, diversified corporations, focusing on the organizational responses to fast-moving, competitive environments. It also contributes to strategy by revealing a ''re-combinant'' multidivisional organizational form, by which timely charter changes can be used by large corporations to keep pace in these turbulent contexts.

AB I examine whether a strategic focus on data analytics is associated with improvements in firms' internal information quality. Using textual analysis of firm disclosures to identify a data analytics strategy, I first document that firm, leadership, and operating environment characteristics are all important determinants of the decision to adopt a data analytics strategy. I next use operating and financial reporting outcomes to infer whether a data analytics strategy improves internal information quality. I find that a data analytics strategy is associated with enhanced operating efficiency, as adopting firms invest and utilize existing resources more efficiently. I also find that a data analytics strategy is associated with more accurate management forecasts. These results, collectively, are consistent with a data analytics strategy improving firms' internal information quality. Lastly, I corroborate and extend my findings with job postings data, and the results suggest that firm leadership signals their support for data analytics initiatives through disclosure.
   Strategie d'analyse des donnees et qualite de l'information interneL'auteure de cette etude examine si l'orientation strategique axee sur l'analyse des donnees est associee a des ameliorations de la qualite de l'information interne des entreprises. Pour identifier une strategie d'analyse des donnees, l'auteure procede a une analyse textuelle des informations fournies par l'entreprise, montrant d'abord que les caracteristiques liees a l'entreprise, au leadership et a l'environnement operationnel sont des determinants importants de la decision d'adopter une strategie d'analyse des donnees. Ensuite, les resultats operationnels et des rapports financiers permettent a l'auteure de deduire si une strategie d'analyse de donnees ameliore la qualite de l'information interne. Les resultats indiquent qu'une strategie d'analyse des donnees est associee a une meilleure efficacite operationnelle, car les entreprises qui l'adoptent investissent et utilisent les ressources existantes de maniere plus efficace. De meme, une strategie d'analyse des donnees est associee a des previsions plus precises de la part de la direction. L'ensemble de ces resultats est coherent avec le fait qu'une strategie d'analyse des donnees ameliore la qualite de l'information interne des entreprises. Enfin, l'auteure corrobore et proroge ses conclusions a l'aide de donnees sur les offres d'emploi. Les conclusions de l'etude indiquent que les dirigeants de l'entreprise soutiennent les initiatives d'analyse des donnees par le biais des informations fournies.

AB Health promotion and disease prevention requires health systems address the patients' social needs using new care delivery models. Yet, research in this area has stalled for several reasons. We study a partnership model of care that couples clinical care delivered by primary care providers and social services delivered by community-based organizations, and its impact on patients' preventive health outcomes and behaviors. We use data from the Mid-Ohio Farmacy, which is a collaboration across the Mid-Ohio Food Collective (MOFC), a network of 650+ affiliated food pantries, and a large federally qualified health center (FQHC). The FQHC offers primary and preventative healthcare services across eight free clinics, which are co-located with the MOFC-affiliated food pantries. Patients were screened for food insecurity during their clinic visit and, if positive, were referred to the Farmacy. Compliers made at least one visit to the food pantry after referral, while noncompliers did not. Using difference-in-differences, we find that compliers had no discernible change in their body mass index (BMI, kg/m2), which we refer to as a BMI stabilization effect. Noncompliers' BMI increased after referral. High comorbid and high pantry use compliers experienced a significant reduction in their BMI and a marginally significant reduction in glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c, %). These patients had unique compliance behaviors, including greater search, frequency, and consistency of food pantry use. Travel costs suggests that high comorbid patients ascribed a greater value to the Farmacy program. In terms of primary care utilization, we find that compliers' clinic visit patterns after referral were consistent with the visit patterns observed in the food secure cohort, suggesting that the Farmacy program may have helped compliers address competing demands that are known to inhibit health behaviors.
   The food and health partnership model of care helps stabilize patient health outcomes, curbing the progressive risk of chronic conditions like obesity, hypertension, and diabetes. Patients with co-morbid conditions had greater search, frequency, and consistency of food pantry use after referral, suggesting that these patients were more likely to use "food as medicine." In terms of primary care utilization, food insecure compliers' clinic visit patterns after referral were consistent with the visit patterns observed in the food secure cohort, suggesting that the partnership model helps compliers address competing demands that inhibit health behaviors.

AB In response to the extended audit report regulations implemented in the United States and internationally, both audit firms and regulators have increased scrutiny over critical audit matters/key audit matters (collectively referred to as CAMs) through internal and external inspections. At the same time, auditors and audit committees (ACs) have altered the content and timing of CAM-related discussions by communicating specific planned audit procedures earlier in the audit process. This study explores the effect of early communication of CAM-related audit procedures to the AC and increased scrutiny from inspections on auditors' propensity to adjust planned audit procedures in the presence of newly identified audit risks. Based on self-justification theory, we predict and find that early communication of planned audit procedures to the AC causes auditors to be less likely to adjust planned audit procedures even when additional risks arise that necessitate change, especially when inspection is likely. This has the potential for diminished audit quality. Interviews with audit partners provide context for how these findings relate to the current auditing environment.
   La communication des questions cles de l'audit entre auditeurs : calendrier, probabilite d'inspection et comite d'auditEn reponse aux changements reglementaires touchant les rapports d'audit aux etats-Unis et a l'echelle internationale, les cabinets d'audit et les autorites de reglementation ont renforce la surveillance des questions critiques de l'audit/questions cles de l'audit (QCA) par l'ajout d'inspections internes et externes. Parallelement, les auditeurs et les comites d'audit ont modifie le contenu et le calendrier des seances de discussions relatives aux QCA en communiquant de maniere plus anticipee les procedures d'audit specifiques etablies dans le processus d'audit. Cette etude explore l'impact de la communication anticipee des procedures d'audit liees aux QCA au sein du comite d'audit. De plus, elle examine comment la surveillance accrue assuree par les inspections influence la propension des auditeurs a adapter les procedures d'audit prevues lorsque de nouveaux risques d'audit sont identifies. Sur la base de la theorie de l'autojustification, les auteurs formulent et etayent l'hypothese selon laquelle la communication anticipee des procedures d'audit au sein du comite d'audit incite les auditeurs a etre moins enclins a adapter les procedures d'audit etablies, meme en presence de risques supplementaires necessitant un changement, surtout si une inspection est probable. Cette situation peut entrainer une diminution de la qualite de l'audit. Des entretiens avec des associes d'audit permettent de comprendre comment ces resultats s'inscrivent dans le present contexte de l'audit.

DE Invisible Hand; Corps Governance; Multiple Stakeholder Approach
AB Proponents of the dominant contemporary model of corporate governance maintain that the shareholder is the primary constituent of the firm. The responsibility for managerial decision makers in this governance system is to maximize shareholder wealth. Neoclassical economists ethically justify this objective with their interpretation of Adam Smith's notion of the Invisible Hand. Using a famous quotation from The Wealth of Nations, they interpret the Invisible Hand as Smith's ( An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations, Methuen & Co., London) assertion that market participants, in pursuing their own self-interests without regard to the interests of others, will collectively provide the optimal economic benefit to society. We argue that the traditional interpretation of Smith is too narrow and potentially harmful to society. In order to fully understand Smith's notion of the influence of the Invisible Hand on human behavior, one must also consider The Theory of Moral Sentiments. In that work, Smith ( The Theory of Moral Sentiments, A. Millar, London) portrays the pursuit of self-interest as only one of several potential motivations for human action. He also acknowledged the existence of a "sympathy principle,'' which refers to the ability and propensity of human beings to consider the interests of others. Heilbroner ( The Essential Adam Smith, W. W. Norton, New York, p. 59) suggests that Smith's sympathy principle allows one to "determine the appropriate degree of self-interest, the proper display of benevolence, the desirable strictness of justice.'' In fact, Smith indicates that ( 1) a society whose members pursue self-interest without a sense of justice will eventually collapse; ( 2) a society whose members pursue self-interest checked by their sense of justice alone will survive; ( 3) a society whose members pursue self-interest, justice, and the interests of others will flourish. Since a more complete reading of Smith indicates that human beings, in considering their own interests, also reflexively consider the interests of others when making decisions, then the traditional corporate governance model appears to be lacking. A broader, multiple stakeholder approach to corporate governance that considers the interests of other constituencies may be more consistent with Smith's views. In particular, Smith's sympathy principle provides a theoretical foundation for a shift away from the narrow, yet dominant, shareholder-based corporate governance model and toward multiple stakeholder models of corporate governance [ e. g., Business and Society: A Strategic Approach to Corporate Citizenship, Houghton Mifflin, Boston, MA] and internal decision-making [e.g., Sloan Management Review 38, ( 1997) 25 37].

AB This study investigates the effect of high level executives' professional experience, expertise, and role in a specific functional area such as finance or corporate development on their reasoning processes when making managerial decisions. Chief Financial Officers (CFOs) and Vice-Presidents of Corporate Development (VPs) in the diversified foods industry were tape recorded as they thought aloud while evaluating four restaurant chains which were candidates for corporate acquisition. The experiment was designed so that these four acquisition candidates varied with respect to key financial and profitability data and such measures of a firm's strategic business position as product concept, markets, distribution channels, labor relations, and managerial expertise and loyalty. The attributes of financial performance and strategic position embedded in the descriptions of candidate firms were validated by an expert panel. The executives also provided rating-scale evaluations of the strategic, financial, and overall desirability of the four candidate firms.
   The taped thought processes (verbal protocols) were analyzed to determine whether CFOs and VPs differed when evaluating the overall desirability of the acquisition candidates in their use of such lines of reasoning as assessments of the candidate's competitive environment, financial strength, management, operations, and the potential financial, managerial, and operational synergies offered by the proposed acquisition. The probability of generating these assessments during the evaluation process did not appear to be related to expertise based on experience or organizational role.
   When the protocols were analyzed with respect to specific business issues identified by CFOs and VPs when evaluating acquisition candidates, however, there was a role/experience effect. Overall ratings of candidate-firm desirability were straightforward functions of the executive's ratings of the candidate's strategic position and financial performance. On average, VPs tended to be more optimistic in their evaluations than CFOs.
   There is modest statistical evidence that VPs and CFOs differ in the emphasis they place on strategic and financial ratings in evaluating a candidate's overall promise. VPs tend to take a balanced view in forming their overall ratings, whereas CFOs place the predominant weight on financial matters.
   The similarity in lines of reasoning used by CFOs and VPs presents evidence of shared expertise at the corporate level. The difference in the attention that CFOs and VPs place on specific business issues suggests that collectively these different perspectives constitute an adaptive survival mechanism which evolves in successful organizations. The mechanism complements the shared expertise and protects organizations from making flawed strategic decisions. Analyzing these role/experience-based differences has value in developing an understanding of how organizations do and should integrate recommendations from executive officers of various functional areas.

   BEHAVIOR; HYPOTHESIS
AB We show that the community of accounting researchers has not fully appreciated the sensitivity of research conclusions to (necessarily) subjective research design choices, and that this failure has led to the subsequent overgeneralization of early evidence.
   Our analysis is based on a case study that examines the effects of two basic research design choices, and subsequent researchers' appreciation of the impact of those choices. To enhance our study's accessibility to a broad cross-section of the accounting research community, our case study focuses on an article that is covered in most accounting doctoral programs - the recipient of the second American Accounting Association "Seminal Contribution to Accounting Literature Award" Beaver's 1968 article on the information content of annual earnings announcements [Beaver, W. (1968). The information content of annual earnings announcements. Empirical research in accounting; Selected studies, 1968. Supplement to Journal of Accounting Research, 6, 67-92.] Our analysis reveals that the research design choices in Beaver's study significantly affected the results. Beaver clearly explained these choices, and was careful in drawing inferences, Nevertheless, subsequent researchers interpreted Beaver's evidence too broadly. Our new empirical evidence suggests that the information content inference is much more fragile than is generally suspected. We also present citation analyses showing that, consistent with the Kuhnian view that adherents of a paradigm tend to ignore (later) anomalous evidence, subsequent researchers largely overlooked post-Beaver evidence that. was inconsistent with the paradigm's interpretation of Beaver's results. The paper concludes with a brief consideration of how cognitive biases of individuals, combined with biases inherent in the review process and the academy in general, foster an environment where the placement of the first research bricks affect the whole wall. While the case study focuses on an archival empirical financial accounting study, consideration of the effects of subjective research design choices and the documented deficiencies in the interpretation of research are relevant to empirical accounting researchers in general and to critical theorists, as well.
   While accounting scholars 'think we understand the impact of research design choices, the evidence presented here suggests that we have collectively failed to apply this understanding in practice. Such failure delays the acquisition of knowledge. This study provides a salient demonstration indicating that we must constantly remain on guard to recognize the subjective nature of research design choices, to consider the likely effects of those choices, and to be cautious in drawing generalizations.

   POPULATION; TECHNOLOGY; DYNAMICS; NEWNESS
AB This paper takes a macroperspective of entrepreneurship, and focuses on the issues and events involved in constructing an industrial infrastructure that facilitates and constrains entrepreneurship. This infrastructure includes: (1) institutional arrangements to legitimate, regulate, and standardize a new technology, (2) public resource endowments of basic scientific knowledge, financing mechanisms, and a pool of competent labor, as well as (3) proprietary R&D, manufacturing, marketing, and distribution functions by private entrepreneurial firms to commercialize the innovation for profit. Although extensive research substantiates the importance of these infrastructure components, they have been treated as externalities to entrepreneurship. By incorporating these components within a single framework, one can systematically examine how various actors and functions interact to facilitate and constrain entrepreneurship.
   The paper makes three contributions to understanding entrepreneurship. First, I believe that the study of entrepreneurship is deficient if it focuses exclusively on the characteristics and behaviors of individual entrepreneurs, on the one hand, and if it treats the social, economic, and political factors influencing entrepreneurship as external demographic statistics, on the other hand. Popular folklore notwithstanding, the process of entrepreneurship is a collective achievement requiring key roles from numerous entrepreneurs in both the public and private sectors.
   Second, the paper examines how and why this infrastructure for entrepreneurship emerges. I argue that while this infrastructure facilitates and constrains individual entrepreneurs, it is the latter who construct and change the industrial infrastructure. This infrastructure does not emerge and change all at once by the actions of one or even a few key entrepreneurs. Instead, it emerges through the accretion of numerous institutional, resource, and proprietary events that co-produce each other over an extended period. Moreover, the very institutional arrangements and resource endowments created to facilitate industry emergence can become inertial forces that hinder subsequent technological development and adaptation by proprietary firms. This generative process has a dynamic history that is itself important to study systematically if one is to understand how novel forms of technologies, organizations, and institutions emerge.
   Finally, the paper emphasizes that the process of entrepreneurship is not limited to the for-profit sector; numerous entrepreneurial actors in the public and not-for-profit sectors play crucial roles. It motivates one to examine the different roles played by these actors, and how their joint contributions interact to develop and commercialize a new technology. This in turn makes it possible to understand how the risk, time, and cost to an individual entrepreneur are significantly influenced by developments in the overall infrastructure for entrepreneurship. It also explains why the entrepreneurs who run in packs will be more successful than those that go it alone to develop their innovations.

AB In my early Processing Fads and Fashions: An Organization-Set Analysis of Cultural Industry Systems" (1972), the middle ''throughput'' phase, or most organizational aspect of cultural industries, was emphasized. In this depoliticized exploration of what Adorno (1991) had earlier characterized as the industrialization of high culture, and Powdermaker (1950) as Hollywood's "dream factory," I emphasized the key roles of gate keeper and distributor organizations as critical in connecting the artist/creators to audience/consumers of mass, or "popular" culture (as it had more acceptingly come to be called). Altogether, this network of organizations-from creators (artists, musicians, actors, writers) and brokers (agents), through the cultural product's producers (publishers, studios), distributors (wholesalers, theaters), and media outlets-collectively constitute cultural industries. This article on industries producing "cultural products"-defined as " 'nonmaterial' goods directed at a public of consumers, for whom they generally serve an esthetic or expressive, rather than a clearly utilitarian function" (Hirsch 1972 p. 641)-appeared at the same time that organizational sociology's focus on what became known as the ''production of culture'' took off, and continued to flourish into the 1990s (Peterson 1994, Crane 1992).
   How has the study of cultural industries changed over the last generation? A simple answer is that the subject-the key role of distribution and the importance of organizational middlemen in the making and sale of popular culture-remains analytically the same. From actors, musicians, and writers; through studios, labels and publishers, to videocassettes, movie theaters, record stores, and booksellers (in stores or via the Internet)-cultural products how. How this sequence is organized and traversed remains a fascinating forest of power plays and techniques, employed by role-occupants in the same positions as have existed since the advent of mass media. While this substantive field has changed little analytically, what we also see is a wondrous expansion in the disciplinary approaches being taken to examine the multitude of topics available for examination under the broad rubric and framing of the term, ''cultural industries." Because I was a graduate student at the time (my roommate dared me to submit the "Processing..." paper to the American Journal of Sociology), it is a great pleasure to find the concept has retained its value for other researchers since that time.
   In this article, I will (1) reexamine and discuss the original framing of the term cultural industries; (2) briefly review some of the mon recent complementary perspectives which expand the possible arenas for studying this topic; and (3) append a short note on how the more recent inclusion of nonprofit cultural products (e.g., symphonies, museums) in this framework poses interesting analytical questions and opportunities.

TI THREATS AND OPPORTUNITIES FACED BY PRIVATE BUSINESSES IN CHINA
SO JOURNAL OF BUSINESS VENTURING
LA English
DT Article
ID REFORM; MARKET
AB This article presents a comprehensive analysis of the environment experienced by private businesses in China through examining their relationships with the major stakeholders-namely government, supplier, employee, customer, and competitor.
   Since the announcement of the economic reform in 1978, substantial political and economic power has been delegated from the central government to the regions.  Endowed with this power, local governments have crucial influence on the size of the private sector within their jurisdiction.  Being outside the state allocation plan, private firms have less access to raw materials and credit.  In the volatile political climate of China, they are vulnerable to attack during political campaigns.  Maintaining a cordial relationship with local cadres, through paying bribes and various charges, is thus a prerequisite for survival.  Having solicited political backing, a private entrepreneur can not only run his business more smoothly, but also may be more tolerated in his illegal activities such as tax evasion, profiteering, and selling banned products.  In short, the whole situation can be described as a collusion of local governments and private businesses at the expense of the central government's interest.
   Under the economic reform, the distribution system has become less rigid than before.  It is easier for private firms to secure supplies, whether raw materials or manufactured goods.  Labor input is also not a problem for most private firms which are small in size and employ mainly unskilled workers.  However, large private enterprises have to compete with state, collective, and foreign enterprises for managerial staff who are in short supply.
   There have been marked changes in the consumption pattern since the early 1980s.  People spend less on staple foods and more on non-staple foods, consumer goods, and services.  Moreover, China is experiencing a consumption boom.  Altogether this offers great opportunities to the private sector, which has been expanding its share of industrial output and retail sales very fast.  On the other hand, competition is becoming much keener.  State enterprises are improving their efficiency and giant multinational corporations are rushing in.  As there are few entry barriers, private entrepreneurs are also competing fiercely among themselves.
   The ideological contradiction of having labor exploitation by private entrepreneurs in a socialist country has prevented the Chinese government from actively encouraging private business.  The private sector has been assigned a supplementary role in the dominant public economy.  This status has led to discrimination against private firms in obtaining factor inputs, accounting partly for their vulnerability to bureaucratic harassment by local cadres.  This will continue to hamper private business development.  It is concluded that ideological and political reforms, in addition to the economic reform, are required for providing a more conducive environment for private businesses.  The Chinese experience of liberalizing the private sector offers useful insights to governments of other developing countries.

AB This study extends extant research on the determinants of financial analyst bias by examining the role that political incentives play. Using a series of scheduled provincial political events in China, we document that analysts are significantly more likely to issue favorable recommendations or revise their recommendations upward during political event periods, and the effect of political events on optimism is larger for analysts employed by brokerage firms affiliated with politicians. Cross-sectional evidence suggests that the impact of political events on analyst optimism is concentrated in those provinces where capital market development is a more important performance indicator for politicians or where the incumbent politicians face a pending promotion. Stock return analyses reveal that favorable recommendations issued during political event periods are significantly less profitable in the long run and are less credible according to investor perceptions. Reinforcing our main evidence, we also find that financial analysts are more likely to issue optimistic earnings forecasts during political event periods. Collectively, our results imply that political incentives distort analyst opinions and political-economic factors affect the corporate information environment in China.
   Motivations politiques et partialit & eacute; des analystes : donn & eacute;es provenant de la ChineCette & eacute;tude propose d'enrichir les connaissances actuelles sur les d & eacute;terminants de la partialit & eacute; des analystes financiers en examinant sp & eacute;cifiquement le r & ocirc;le des motivations politiques. En utilisant une s & eacute;rie d'& eacute;v & egrave;nements politiques programm & eacute;s au niveau provincial en Chine, les auteurs recueillent des donn & eacute;es indiquant que les analystes sont plus enclins & agrave; & eacute;mettre des recommandations favorables ou de reformuler leurs recommandations de mani & egrave;re plus positive en p & eacute;riode d'& eacute;v & egrave;nements politiques. L'effet des & eacute;v & egrave;nements politiques sur l'optimisme est plus marqu & eacute; chez les analystes travaillant pour des maisons de courtage affili & eacute;es & agrave; des politiciens. Les donn & eacute;es transversales sugg & egrave;rent que l'impact des & eacute;v & egrave;nements politiques sur l'optimisme des analystes se manifeste surtout dans les provinces o & ugrave; le d & eacute;veloppement du march & eacute; financier est un indicateur de performance plus important pour les politiciens, ou dans celles o & ugrave; ces derniers sont sur le point d'& ecirc;tre promus. Les analyses de rendements des actions r & eacute;v & egrave;lent que les recommandations favorables & eacute;mises en p & eacute;riode d'& eacute;v & egrave;nements politiques sont significativement moins utiles & agrave; long terme et moins cr & eacute;dibles selon les perceptions des investisseurs. Les donn & eacute;es consolid & eacute;es montrent & eacute;galement que les analystes financiers sont plus susceptibles d'& eacute;mettre des pr & eacute;visions de r & eacute;sultats optimistes en p & eacute;riode d'& eacute;v & egrave;nements politiques. Pris globalement, les r & eacute;sultats laissent croire que les motivations politiques alt & egrave;rent les jugements des analystes et que les facteurs politico-& eacute;conomiques affectent l'environnement informationnel des entreprises en Chine.

ID ENTREPRENEURSHIP; INNOVATION
AB If innovation is to be pursued as a long-term strategic move for prosperity rather than a survival tactic in troublesome times, an alternative focus is needed. Energies should be redirected toward maintenance responsibilities involving the overall corporate system rather than limiting efforts to venture initiation activities. While previous studies have investigated correlates of corporate entrepreneurship and its subsequent effect on organizational performance, few researchers have demonstrated any viable means of maintaining internally developed ventures (Biggadike 1979; Jennings et al. 1990; Jennings and Young 1990; Zahra 1991).
   This research piece posits long-term maintenance of an innovative organization as a joint function of identifying and securing the loyally of innovative-minded individuals and building appropriate organizational factors (e.g., structural and reward system) to retain them. In order to address this objective, this study examines the relationship between a set of key individual and organizational factors and a set of outcome variables consisting of specific job attitudes (job satisfaction, organizational commitment) and propensity to leave the organization for two types of managers, autonomous venture managers (AVMs) and departmental managers (DMs).
   This study surveyed upper middle level managers in Fortune 500 companies in organizational positions where the scope of their positions appeared to include the potential for innovation or autonomous action. Managers were classified as autonomous venture managers (AVMs) or departmental managers (DMs) based on autonomy and independence in decision-making. Managers who were heads of autonomous business units (e.g., venture groups) were classified as AVMs while those who were wt heads of such units were classified as DMs.
   Separate regression equations were constructed relating the set of individual and organizational factors to each of the aforementioned outcome variables for A VMs and DMs. It was hypothesized that significantly different individual and organizational factors would emerge across the outcome variables such that a distinctive response pattern would be present for both types of managers. Regression analysis and Chow tests indicated that only the organizational commitment model was significantly different for AVMs and DMs. The job satisfaction and propensity to leave models were not significantly different for the AVMs and DMs. Consequently, the overriding finding suggests that separate reward and structural alternatives are not necessary or even desirable for the two groups of managers. Further, the individual characteristics for the AVMs and DMs were descriptive of both groups. The challenge for organizational management practices appears to be the careful construction and nurturing of an innovative organizational environment to create potential for creative activities. Explicit actions that management in large, established organizations may take to build effectively an innovative organizational environment include the following: 1 .Making available both formal and informal structural outlets for creative activities to all managers. This means actively building venture groups as well as allowing free time to pursue projects of one's own undertaking. 2 . Reinforcing the opportunity to engage in innovative activities for all managers via financial and non-financial rewards. 3 . Recruiting for corporate entrepreneuring positions within the organization. Collectively, the managers were found to be potentially creative, resourceful individuals interested in innovation.

AB Securities litigation risk is a well-recognized yet underexplored source of financial reporting complexity or unreadability. This study examines the effect of litigation risk on the readability of corporate financial reports. The 1999 Silicon Graphics Inc. (SGI) court ruling unexpectedly reduced litigation risk for firms within the Ninth Circuit Court's jurisdiction. Using a difference-in-differences design centered on the SGI court ruling, we find that, while the readability of financial reports generally declines over the sample period, treated firms in the Ninth Circuit experience a comparatively smaller decline in readability than control firms in other states after the ruling. Put differently, treated firms experience a relative improvement in reporting readability following the ruling. This effect is concentrated among firms prone to securities litigation and those with greater external financing needs, but it is muted for firms engaging in earnings management. Furthermore, improved reporting readability among treated firms can be partially attributed to alleviated concerns about the adequacy of cautionary language, as evidenced by a significant decrease in negative forward-looking statements, particularly risk-related ones. Collectively, our findings suggest that securities litigation risk contributes to reduced readability in financial reporting.
   L'enlisement des investisseurs : une cons & eacute;quence inattendue du risque de litigeLe risque de litige en mati & egrave;re de valeurs mobili & egrave;res est une source bien connue, mais insuffisamment & eacute;tudi & eacute;e, de complexit & eacute; ou d'illisibilit & eacute; de l'information financi & egrave;re. Cette & eacute;tude examine l'effet du risque de litige sur la lisibilit & eacute; des & eacute;tats financiers des entreprises. La d & eacute;cision de justice rendue en 1999 dans l'affaire Silicon Graphics Inc. a r & eacute;duit de mani & egrave;re inattendue le risque de litige pour les entreprises relevant de la comp & eacute;tence de la << Cour du neuvi & egrave;me circuit >> (Ninth Circuit Court). En utilisant un mod & egrave;le de diff & eacute;rence dans les diff & eacute;rences centr & eacute; sur la d & eacute;cision de justice de SGI, nous constatons que, bien que la lisibilit & eacute; des & eacute;tats financiers diminue g & eacute;n & eacute;ralement au cours de la p & eacute;riode d'& eacute;chantillonnage, les entreprises trait & eacute;es du neuvi & egrave;me circuit connaissent une baisse de lisibilit & eacute; comparativement plus faible que les entreprises de contr & ocirc;le dans d'autres & Eacute;tats apr & egrave;s la d & eacute;cision de justice. En d'autres termes, les entreprises trait & eacute;es connaissent une am & eacute;lioration relative de la lisibilit & eacute; des divulgations apr & egrave;s l'arr & ecirc;t. Cet effet se concentre sur les entreprises sujettes & agrave; des litiges en mati & egrave;re de valeurs mobili & egrave;res et sur celles qui ont des besoins de financement externe plus importants, mais il est att & eacute;nu & eacute; pour les entreprises qui pratiquent la gestion du r & eacute;sultat. En outre, l'am & eacute;lioration de la lisibilit & eacute; des divulgations parmi les entreprises trait & eacute;es peut & ecirc;tre partiellement attribu & eacute;e & agrave; l'att & eacute;nuation des pr & eacute;occupations concernant l'ad & eacute;quation du langage de mise en garde, comme le montre une diminution significative des d & eacute;clarations prospectives n & eacute;gatives, en particulier celles qui sont li & eacute;es au risque. Dans l'ensemble, nos r & eacute;sultats sugg & egrave;rent que le risque de litige en mati & egrave;re de valeurs mobili & egrave;res contribue & agrave; r & eacute;duire la lisibilit & eacute; de l'information financi & egrave;re.

TI A qualitative study of managerial challenges facing small business
   geographic expansion
SO JOURNAL OF BUSINESS VENTURING

   STORIES
AB Geographic expansion is a common growth strategy used by small, entrepreneurial firms. Yet, despite the importance of geographic expansion as a growth strategy, it is a neglected area of small business research. To date, research in the area of small business growth has focused on broad issues, such as the common ''obstacles'' to firm growth and the relationship between firm growth and firm profitability. Whereas this literature is suggestive, it does not provide specific prescriptive advice to small business managers pursuing geographic expansion as a growth strategy.
   As a first step in generating prescriptive advice in this area, this study examined the managerial challenges that faced one small firm during the early stages of its efforts to expand geographically. The subject organization, referred to as the Local Advertising Company (LAG), operated in a single location from 1968 to 1990. As a means to initiate firm growth, the owners of the company opened eight new locations in 1991 and eight more in 1992. However, problems ensued. This study used a qualitative research methodology to conduct an assessment of the managerial challenges facing the LAC during its geographic expansion effort.
   Seventeen key employees of LAC were interviewed for the study. The qualitative case study methodology used provided an opportunity to gather in-depth information from informants regarding their individual assessment of the managerial challenges encountered by LAC during its geographic expansion. Collectively, the respondents identified a number of specific management issues that became problematic during LACS geographic expansion effort. Through a content analysis technique, these issues were organized into 15 thematic categories including training, recruitment and selection, the relationship between the field staff and the original owners, and 12 others. Each of these categories represents the separate managerial challenges faced by the company during its geographic expansion.
   The study provides a descriptive analysis of each of the 15 categories of managerial challenges that emerged. The research results suggest that the successful management of a geographic expansion growth strategy requires managers to deal with a unique set of issues. For example, the training of new employees may become problematic when the most experienced personnel in the limit reside in the home office and the new trainees are located in widely dispersed geographic locations.
   In addition, the results of the study provide an extension to both practical and theoretical knowledge in three distinct areas: planning for growth, managing growth, and the reasons for growth. First, the results of the study support the importance of planning for growth, but suggest that planning must be complemented by learning and a willingness to evolve one's plan as growth progresses. In terms of the management of growth, the case shows that running a small business and growing a small business do not include the same skill set. The owners of LAC had been quite successful managing their single location for 22 years. However, this ability to run a business did not complement the need to anticipate start-up problems in new, remote sites, which is inherent in a strategy of geographic expansion. In addition, the case demonstrated that the management of growth requires a cognizance on the part of the original owners of a firm to delegate control. Finally, with regard to the reasons for growth, researchers generally characterize firm growth as being motivated by either economic (e. g., economies of scale) or emotional reasons (e.g., employing family members). The owners of LAC initiated firm growth for the purpose of wealth creation to fund their retirements. This illustrates that firm growth; can be motivated by a combination of both economic (e.g., wealth creation) and personal (e.g., retirement security) reasons.

TI Journal of Business Venturing 2024 year in review: The year of
   exercising entrepreneurial agency in response to crises
SO JOURNAL OF BUSINESS VENTURING
LA English
DT Article
DE Entrepreneurship; Agency; Action; Paradox; Social Symbolic Work; Review
AB When various forms of crisis hit, they can stimulate changes in entrepreneurial agency - the capacity to act (or choose not to) - and the actions entrepreneurs take to mitigate the threats and pursue the new opportunities those crises create. While assessing articles for the Journal of Business Venturing's annual "Best Paper" award, we observed this to be a recurring theme across a significant number of the studies published in 2024. Inspired by this research, we summarize the 17 articles that explored this theme and develop a framework that highlights material, relational, and discursive concerns brought about by crises. In response entrepreneurs across individual or collective levels take action to preserve or cultivate distinct forms of entrepreneurial agency - adaptive, allied, and censored - and to resolve various paradoxes of entrepreneurial agency. We close with a brief discussion of the growing relevance of a social symbolic lens in reconciling how entrepreneurs construe and respond to crises and how the specific forms of agency and paradox identified could inform theory both within and beyond entrepreneurship. Executive summary: This article began as a search for the "Best Paper" published in Journal of Business Venturing (JBV) in 2024. The editor-in-chief selected a panel of editors who then reviewed each of the 49 articles published in volume 39, issues 1-6, to identify those that were bold, broad, and rigorous. We arrived at a shortlist of five articles that best exemplified these criteria, from which the entire JBV editorial team voted for the winner: "Sight unseen: The visibility paradox of entrepreneurship in an informal economy," by Robert Nason, Siddharth Vedula, Joel Bothello, Sophie Bacq, and Andrew Charman. In addition to enabling the selection of a best paper, this process revealed a common theme cutting across more than one-third of the articles published throughout the year; namely, "how entrepreneurs exercise agency in response to crises." Traditionally, crises have been defined as periods of turmoil that disrupt patterns of economic activities and represent acute potential threats to the livelihoods of those affected. Over the past decade, however, scholars (both within and outside the field of entrepreneurship) have gradually shifted attention from single, separate, and short-lasting episodes that momentarily disrupt entrepreneurial endeavors (Doern et al., 2016) to plural, entangled and long-lasting combinations, sometimes referred to as poly-crises (Klyver and McMullen, 2025). To consider both conceptualizations, we take a broader perspective of crisis, using the term holistically to include both acute and enduring widespread structural challenges. We reason that, by defying conformity and attempting actions that question a society's taken for granted assumptions about how the world works, entrepreneurs embody and enact a paradox of agency in which restrictions on their capacity to act - which dispirit, discourage, or even devastate most people - instead stimulate them to seek to preserve or cultivate their agency not only by mitigating the threats that crises can pose, but also by leveraging them as opportunities to improve their situation. We proceed as follows. After a brief introduction, we summarize how each individual article reflects and contributes unique insights to the overarching theme of exercising entrepreneurial agency in response to crises.
   Grouping the articles according to the type of crisis examined, we sensitize ourselves to the underlying mechanisms that entrepreneurs use in response by adopting a social symbolic lens (Lawrence and Phillips, 2019). Specifically, we hone our attention to the relative importance and interplay of material, relational, and discursive dimensions of social symbolic work as entrepreneurs construe and respond to different types of crises. We suggest that entrepreneurs encounter various limitations to and paradoxes of agency that they seek to resolve by adapting, allying, or censoring their capacity to act. Finally, we conclude by articulating potential avenues for scholars to elaborate on this tri-dimensional approach to entrepreneurial agency both within and beyond entrepreneurship theory and practice.

AB Contractual terms guide many entrepreneur-franchisees' actions with the franchisor. However, it is impossible for franchisors to completely specify all future actions. They compensate by continually attempting to influence franchisees, using what franchisees perceive as suasion in their ongoing inter actions. We develop a theoretical framework for understanding the informal interaction dynamics between franchisors and franchisees.
   Most franchise arrangements include the payment of royalties based on sales. This encourages a growth-oriented strategy, usually appropriate for the franchisees during the initial stages of their operations. Whereas a franchising strategy can reduce entreprenerial risk for franchisees, it does not eliminate it. Thus, as sales of the franchisees increase, profit-oriented strategies will be favored because they represent the payoffs that accrue to continuing entrepreneurial effort and risk-taking. These strategies may be in opposition to franchisors' safes orientation when market conditions do not allow continual growth without margin penalties. A research model is developed, depicting the relationship between franchisees' strategies and performance, and the moderating effect that contractual goals and franchisees' perception of franchisors' attempts at suasion have on this relationship. A set of research hypotheses was then empirically tested using a large sample of franchisees from the commercial truck retailing industry.
   The results indicate that sales-growth and profit-growth goals are not always congruent. Balancing the goals of the franchisor and franchisee did nor appear to be a popular option; either one or the other was emphasized. More importantly, the results indicate that when franchisees perceive attempts by franchisors to rise suasion, lower levels of profits result, brit there is no corresponding increase in the level of sales.
   In the long-term, franchisors are likely to determine that current contractual arrangements are not protecting their longer term interests. Thus, they will be expected to attempt to modify franchise contracts in ways that force franchisees to implement sales-gain strategies. This will require that entrepreneur-franchisees anticipate future events more carefully at the time they are examining the original franchise contract. Because most entrepreneurs are concerned with immediate survival at the start-rtp stage, this makes examination of the contract less likely to happen; the franchise option is attractive because it reduces such risks.
   We recommend that entrepreneurs write er ante contingent claims contracts that ensure a gradual reduction of franchisor influence. Although this would assume a power or knowledge balance that favors the franchisees, which is unlikely driving the start-rip phase, it will change over time as franchisees gain a better understanding of the local competitive dynamics. Thus, it may well serve the franchisees to take a defensive posture or push a royalty arrangement that decreases the emphasis on sales over time. This is most likely to be effective,where the entrepreneur is considering several competing franchises at the time of the signing of the contract.
   Finally, we recommend that entrepreneur-franchisees should nor assume that the expert advice offered by their franchisor is always in their best interests. Although technical advice is more likely to be unbiased and should be fully exploited, as this is what makes the franchise valuable, strategic advice, or that which relates to goal setting may well be colored by the financial interests of the franchisor. Franchisors are unlikely to consider the possibility that franchisees would be better served by formulating their own strategies, nor are they likely to consider that the franchise network would be better off; in the longer term, by the collective impact associated with numerous franchisees independently formulating their own strategies. in short, although we do not suggest that franchisees should always assume that ''crossing mother'' is the best response to all perceived franchisor-suasion efforts, they should carefully examine all strategic advice.

AB Success in today's competitive environment requires a company to pursue a coherent technology strategy to articulate its plans to develop, acquire, and deploy technological resources to achieve superior financial performance. This strategy clarifies the company's choices on: being a technological pioneer or a follower, the breadth of the technology product and process portfolios, amounts of investments in internal R&D and external sources of technology, and level of technological forecasting to be performed In turn, these choices require making decisions on the basic and applied R&D to be conduced, the intended offensive or defensive uses of the technology, and emphasis on incremental and radical R&D.
   To date, however few studies have attempted to document the collective implications of a company's technological choices for its financial performance. In response, data from 176 manufacturing companies were used to examine the association between a company's technology strategy and its financial performance and to explore the moderating effect of the environment on the technology strategy-performance link. Therefore, the study focused on a company's perceptions of environmental dynamism, hostility, and heterogeneity. Dynamism indicated the perceived continuity of changes in art industry. Hostility referred to the changes in the industry that could adversely impact the firm's operations and performance. Heterogeneity meant that the environment encompassed many segments with different needs. The study developed and empirically tested the following hypotheses:
   H1a: pioneering will be highest among firms whose environments are highly dynamic, moderately hostile, and moderately heterogeneous.
   H1b: Followership will be highest among firms whose environments are highly hostile and moderately dynamic but low in heterogeneity.
   H2a: Radical product technologies will be pursued most by firms whose environments are highly dynamic, moderately hostile, and moderately heterogeneous.
   H2b: Radical process technologies will be pursued most by firms whose environments are moderately dynamic, moderately hostile, and moderately heterogeneous.
   H2c: Incremental product and process technologies will be pursued most by firms whose environments are stable (low dynamism), benign (low hostility), and highly heterogeneous.
   H3: The broadest technological portfolios will exist among firms whose environments are characterized by moderate dynamism, high heterogeneity, and moderate or low hostility.
   H4: R&D spending will be highest among firms whose environments are highly dynamic, highly heterogeneous, and highly benign (low in hostility).
   H5: The use of external technology sources will be highest among firms whose environments are highly dynamic, highly hostile, and highly heterogeneous.
   H6: Emphasis on technological forecasting will be highest among firms whose environments are highly dynamic, highly hostile, and highly heterogeneous.
   H7: The environment is a quasi-moderator of the technology strategy-performance relationship.
   The results supported the study's hypotheses except H2c and H3 and suggested five ideas for managerial action. (I) Executives should develop and use a comprehensive technology strategy to ensure that their company achieves superior financial performance. (2) Executives should be cautious in applying generic prescriptions of how to utilize technological resources to achieve profitability, because the financial payoff from technology strategy variables varies from one environment to the other. Instead, executives should examine their company's goals, capacity to manage diverse product and process initiatives, risk-taking orientation, resources, and the environment (3) Attention to developing and using process technology innovation is necessary for success. In fact, a broad process innovation portfolio is positively associated with return on assets in the overall sample and in three of the study's five clusters. (4) Managers need to adopt a long-term perspective in making R&D investments, where patient investments over several years are the norm. Increasing R&D spending should nor be viewed as a quick fix for the company's poor competitive position. (5) Whereas the external sources of technology can improve the company's performance, managers should identify the conditions under which external sources can be used and educate their employees on the growing importance of these technologies for achieving profitability.

TI Shopping behavior and consumer preference for store price format: Why
   "large basket" shoppers prefer EDLP
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
LA English
DT Article
ID BRAND; CHOICE; MODEL
AB In recent years, the supermarket industry has become increasingly competitive. One outcome has been the proliferation of a variety of pricing formats, and considerable debate among academics and practitioners about how these formats affect consumers' store choice behavior. This paper advances the idea that consumer shopping behavior (as defined by average size of the shopping basket and the frequency of store visits) is an important determinant of the store choice decision when stores offer different price formats. A recent Wall Street Journal article that summarized the result of Bruno's management switching the chain from EDLP to HILO illustrates the importance of this issue: "The company's price-conscious customers, used to shopping for a fixed basket of goods, stayed away in droves." Thus, the audience for this paper includes practitioners and academics who wish to understand store choices or predict how a change in price format might affect store profitability and the mix of clientele that shop there.
   This paper attempts to understand the relationship between grocery shopping behavior, retail price format, and store choice by posing and answering the following questions. First, after controlling for other factors (e.g., distance to the store, prior experience in the store, advertised specials), do consumer expectations about prices for a basket of grocery products ("expected basket attractiveness") influence the store choice decision? This is a fairly straightforward test of the effect of price expectations on store choice. Second, are different pricing formats (EDLP or HILO) more or less attractive to different types of shoppers? To adequately answer the second question, we must link consumers' category purchase decisions, which collectively define the market basket, and the store choice decision.
   We study the research questions using two complementary approaches. First, we develop a stylized theory of consumer shopping behavior under price uncertainty. The principal features and results from the stylized model can be summarized as follows. Shoppers are defined (in a relative sense) as either large or small basket shoppers. Thus, we abstract from the vicissitudes of individual shopping trips and focus on meaningful differences across shoppers in terms of the expected basket size per trip. The shoppers make category purchase incidence decisions and can choose to shop in either an EDLP or a HILO store. Large basket shoppers are shoppers who have a relatively high probability of purchase for any given category, and as such they are more captive to prices across many different categories. The first two propositions summarize the price responsiveness of shoppers. In particular, the large basket shoppers are less responsive to price in their individual category purchase incidence decisions; this makes them ware responsive to the expected basket price in their store choice decisions. This key structural implication of the model highlights an asymmetry between response at the category level and response at the store level. The result is quite intuitive; a (large basket) shopper with less ability to respond to prices in individual product categories will be more sensitive to the expected cost of the overall portfolio (the market basket) when choosing a store. The final proposition derives the price at which a given shopper will be indifferent between an EDLP and a HILO store. The key insight is that as a shopper increases his or her tendency to become a large basket shopper, the EDLP stare can increase its (constant) price closer and closer to the average price in the HILO store. Conversely, as the shopper becomes more of small basket shopper, the EDLP store must lower its price closer to the deal price in the HILO store. Thus, we have the interesting result that small basket shoppers prefer HILO stores, even at higher average prices.
   The empirical testing mirrors the development of the consumer theory. We test the implications of the propositions using a market basket scanner panel database. The database includes two years of shopping data for 1,042 households in two separate market areas. We first use household-level grocery expenditures to model the probability that a household is a large or small basket shopper. Subsequently, we estimate purchase incidence and store choice models. We find that after controlling for important factors such as household distance to the store, previous experience in the store, and advertised specials, price expectations for the basket influence store choice. Furthermore, EDLP stores get a greater than expected share of business from large basket shoppers; HILO stores get a greater than expected share from small basket shoppers. Consistent with the implications of the propositions, large basket shoppers are relatively price inelastic in their category purchase incidence decisions and price elastic in their store choice decisions.

AB Building on the insights from observational learning and other social influence research, this study challenges the existing literature that proposes a linear relationship between prior funding and subsequent contributions in the crowdfunding setting. Instead, we propose a U-shaped relationship, illustrating a negative relationship between prior funding and subsequent contributions when funding amounts are small and this relationship becomes positive when prior funding amounts are large. Consistent with the rational herding perspective, we assume that individuals do not mindlessly mimic one others' behaviors, but incorporate quality signals into their decision-making. Signals indicating a high quality project such as video quality, as well as the preparedness and passion of the entrepreneur enhance this U-shaped relationship whereas indicators of situational urgency weaken this relationship. Based on a sample of 11,019 daily observations of 333 Kickstarter projects, we find general support for our hypotheses. Our post hoc experiment further supports the mechanisms underlying the U-shaped relationship. This paper extends our understanding of the relationship between past actions and subsequent behavior, and contributes to the literatures of observational learning, crowdfunding, and visual information.
   Executive summary: We challenge the extant literature that has proposed, but inconsistently documented, a positive effect of prior funding on subsequent crowdfunding contributions. We argue that such inconsistency is due to the lack of integration of insights from other social influence research, such as observational learning, threshold models, and bystander effects. This research has been limited when postulating that crowdfunding backers simply imitate others' actions in order to mitigate uncertainty producing a linear effect, yet such an effect depends on the intensity of others' actions and may be curvilinear. This research overlooks the fact that backers do not merely passively imitate others' behaviors, but incorporate quality signals sent by entrepreneurs to make such decisions. Thus, it is important to account for potential moderators that may influence the complex relationship between prior funding and subsequent contributions.
   Based on observational learning research and related models, accrued prior funding may be perceived differently by potential backers: individuals may view accrued funding as a sign of a decreased funding need on the part of a campaign's creators, because others are already backing the campaign or, alternatively, they may see it as a cue of high product quality. These conflicting effects may lead to a U-shaped relationship between prior funding and subsequent contributions at a collective level. At low funding levels, prior funding may be negatively associated with subsequent contributions because such levels indicate there is already support, but that the campaign may not be of high quality. At medium levels, prior funding may have no effect on contributions, aside from halfhearted interest of other backers. At high levels, prior funding may be positively related to subsequent contributions as this sends a robust cue of project quality and convinces prospective donors to contribute. Further, we derive a U-shaped relationship which may be moderated by visual media-based quality signals and situational urgency.
   To test these hypotheses, we conducted two studies. One was a field study of 333 Kickstarter projects, with 11,019 daily observations of crowdfunding activities from mid-February 2013 through mid-April 2013. We used the Kicktraq website to track Kickstarter projects and recruited 390 participants via Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) to evaluate the video pitches on Kickstarter. Our results suggest a negative relationship between prior funding and subsequent contributions when funding amounts are small. This relationship becomes positive when prior funding amounts are large. Thus, we find a U-shaped relationship between prior funding and subsequent contributions, with an inflection point when prior funding amounts reach between 72% and 80% of the funding goal. This is strengthened in the presence of visual media-based quality signals, such as video quality, as well as the preparedness and passion of the entrepreneur. However, indicators of situational urgency may weaken this U-shaped relationship.
   We followed up with a post hoc experiment to document the two mechanisms by which prior funding influence subsequent contributions. We found that increases in the prior funding amount increased perceived product quality but decreased perceived urgency. These perceptions were found to jointly influence participants' proposed pledged amounts, supporting an explanation of a complex relationship between prior funding and subsequent contributions.
   This study is among the first to offer a more complete picture of the relationship between past actions and subsequent behavior under market and institutional constraints (i.e., when market actors observe the censored behaviors of other actors on crowdfunding platforms) and contributes to the literatures of observational learning, crowdfunding, and visual information.

TI More than you think: An inclusive estimate of business entries
SO JOURNAL OF BUSINESS VENTURING
LA English
DT Article
AB The Wells Fargo/NFIB Series on Business Entries and Exits collected data throughout 1995 from 36,000 households regarding the business formation activity occurring among adults within those households. After adjusting for the 1.37 owners per firm and the 10% of households with more than one entry, there were an estimated 4.553-million business entries in the 12-month period involving 6.211 million active owners. Seventy-eight and one-half (78.5) percent of those businesses were de novo starts 20.0% purchases and the remainder other forms of entry (including missing responses). Most of the entries were quite small whether started or purchased.
   The number of business entries is significantly larger than prior estimates. However, the 4.553-million figure, when dissected into component parts, is consistent with other measures of business entry. The primary reason for the larger estimate is that this research was able to capture the significant number of very small entries that either do not appear in other databases or appear only after a substantial delay.
   These new data offer a significantly expanded view of the American business population and its dynamics. More specifically they provide quantification of the smaller end of the entry scale, thereby introducing new population distributions and raising fundamental research and marketing questions about the unit of analysis (What is a business?) What constitutes a reasonable survey sample? To what population do we generalize survey data What are the market segments of the small-business population, and how do they differ What are the public policy requirements of these segments and how do they coincide and conflict And, what do real entry numbers tell us about the operation of the American economy on both a secular and cyclical basis?
   The foregoing are obvious. However, there are more subtle and perhaps more interesting questions. For example, the more people try To go into business for themselves, the more our collective (American) experience is influenced by the experience of business ownership. Small business draws enormous empathy from the American public; few Americans institutions are as popular. This is obviously a complex phenomenon. However, one explanation for its popularity is that so many Americans are exposed to business ownership either personally or through someone they know. Part of this research not yet published shows that small-business ownership pervades every class, income category, racial grouping, etc. The penetration of business formation into the American experience, therefore, is not only deep, it is also broad. And when its dimensions are so great the remaining issue is not the existence of influence bur its degree.
   If there are more starts than previously recognized, there must also be more exits. And if there are more exits, the dynamics of the business entry-exit process become even more tumultuous than previously recognized. Particularly for those interested in either policy or management, the question becomes, ''Why is exit so common?'' One path of inquiry leads to motivation for entry including career alternatives and income supplementation. To what extent do people intend to grow their businesses and to what extent do they intend their businesses to fill financial, occupational, or time gaps until[ something better comes along? Another path of inquiry leads to resources. Do resource constraints or constraints of other natures impede business development? Then there is the issue of preparation. How well-prepared are entrants And, what reasonable steps can be taken to improve their assessments of potential opportunities or to effectively implement plans to capitalize on them? These are not necessarily new issues. But they become more conspicuous and pressing when the large number of exits is appreciated.
   The technique used to capture these data at a reasonable cost is called an ''omnibus'' or ''caravan'' survey. This survey technique is not well-known outside the commercial survey industry, but it presents considerable opportunity for researchers either with limited budgets or desirous of asking fewer than 10-15-minutes' worth of questions from a sample of the adult population. Its advantage is financial. Multiple sponsors can ask a limited number of proprietary questions at their own expense. But they then share the costs and results of reaching respondents and of asking the demographic questions, for example, age or sex of respondent. The current research posed two screen questions to all 36,000 households interviewed. The sponsors paid for those 72,000 questions. But only about 2,000 respondents passed one of the screens. These respondents were led through several more questions. Thus, the sponsors paid just for the scr een questions and those questions administered to the 2,000. An extensive set of demographic data about the respondents was thrown in ''free.'' (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Inc.

TI A comparative study of values among Chinese and US entrepreneurs:
   Pragmatic convergence between contrasting cultures
SO JOURNAL OF BUSINESS VENTURING

   DECISION-MAKING; WORK VALUES; STABILITY; SYSTEMS; REFORM; WOMEN
AB The People's Republic of China is the world's leading Communist power, ver it also represents the largest potential market for international investment and development. In recent years, China has actively pursued private enterprise development, passing its first Private Company Act in 1988, and subsequently encouraging entrepreneurial activities. More than a half-million new ventures in high-growth manufacturing, engineering, and infrastructural development have been independently established in China in little more than six years, and although it would be presumptuous to assume that China is racing toward a free enterprise economy there are major changes taking place. From an entrepreneurial perspective, these changes are in sharp contrast to the nation's political ideology, and those who are pursuing new ventures constitute a vanguard of individuals at adds with a majority of society.
   A critical concern is whether China's entrepreneurs pose a threat to those who are entrenched in a political ideology that, by definition is opposed to flee market economics and private enterprise. As Hofstede (1980) has pointed out, characteristics of a people are defined by their prevailing value systems, and research by Bond (1991), Hofstede (1983a, 1983b), Schwartz (1992), and Triandis et al. (1986) has shown that by systematically studying human values we can gain valuable insights about patterns of behavior, motivation, and expectations of cross-cultural boundaries. Consequently, this study was developed to replicate previous value-related studies among Chinese entrepreneurs and nonentrepreneurial managers. A sample of more than 200 executives of state-owned and privately founded industrial companies provided comparable groups for comprehensive interviews. An analogous sample of U.S. entrepreneurs was selected to represent Western values. This extends several previous studies on private enterprise development in China, but, clearly, the convenient and limited sample cannot be construed as representative of a geographically and ethnically diversified country of more than 1.1 billion people. However, it does provide useful insights to differences and similarities in work-related values between Chinese entrepreneurs, managers, and U.S. entrepreneurs as exploratory research.
   A primary consideration of this study was to enrich the existing research concerning entrepreneurial values, and in the process, question whether Chinese entrepreneurial values are similar to those held by U.S. entrepreneurs. If so, there would be a stronger case for convergence of value systems and commensurate behavior. Similarities would also support arguments by many that entrepreneurial characteristics, such as individualism, achievement motives, and self-deterministic behavior, are universal. This is complicated, however, by a Confucian social philosophy that places little value on these attributes while underscoring the importance of collective behavior, conformist behavior, and referent group loyalty. It is further complicated by two generations of Communist doctrine that has suppressed individual initiative, commercial achievement, and social mobility. Can entrepreneurial values prevail under such adverse conditions? More specifically, can values associated with individualism and self-determination exist in a society that is collectivist and conformist? Several recent studies on entrepreneurial values suggest that apparent contradictory value sets might co-exist (Baum et al. 1993; Chow and Tsang 1994; Erez and Earley 1993; Hofstede and Bond 1988; Holt Ralston, and Terpstra 1994). Entrepreneurial research has also questioned the concept of universal values and found that, in many instances, cultural-based values are not necessarily malleable (McGrath et al. 1992), values are often contingent on prevailing cultural antecedents (Shenkar and Von Glinow 1994), and discordant or paradoxical values exist within so-called collectivist societies, among presumed cohesive groups, and within well-defined ethnic clusters (McGrath, MacMillan, and Scheinberg 1992; Ohe, Honjo, and MacMillan 1990; Ralston et al. 1993; Triandis et al. 1988).
   The current study revealed patterns of value orientations among Chinese entrepreneurs, Chinese executives of state-owned or joint venture firms, and U.S. entrepreneurs that in some instances were substantially different, and in other instances quite similar. Contrasts in these patterns suggest an apparent paradox of entrepreneurship in a collectivist society like China, and in particular, a potential confrontation between Chinese entrepreneurs and nonentrepreneurial managers. The results showed that, indeed the respondent Chinese managers and entrepreneurs differed sharply on many crucial value dimensions, and although the survey was limited to a southern industrial province, there is the possibility that China may be facing an extremely difficult transition period toward a constrained market economy with overtones of a possible ideological backlash. The results revealed many similarities between the respondent Chinese and U.S. entrepreneurs, but also several important differences steeped in Confucian social philosophy. Although there may be some convergence in values, it is more likely that Chinese entrepreneurs are simply pragmatic, and therefore selective in developing behavior that reflects values associated with achievement, independence, freedom of choice, and self-determination. If these results could be interpreted as prevalent beyond our exploratory sample, then pragmatic expectations may be driving private enterprise development in China more than cultural values, but this is difficult to verify. Whatever implications are drawn from this study must also be taken cautiously because there are indications that definitions of certain values, such as achievement or independence, may have substantially different meanings to American and Chinese entrepreneurs. Care was taken to make translations comparable during the field interviews, but Western concepts inherent in the instruments used for value research may have elicited responses or associated meanings among the Chinese that cannot be accurately interpreted.
