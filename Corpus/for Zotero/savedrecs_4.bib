Abstract = {This article reports on an experiment that was undertaken to elicit the
   shared perceptions of a group of individuals in relation to a particular
   organizational domain. These shared perceptions were termed collective
   beliefs, and were to be modelled in the form of a causal cognitive map.
   An initial conceptual framework was presented in which it was posited
   that groups of individuals who work closely together share a set of
   common beliefs which enable them to function successfully as a group.
   These shared beliefs are an integral part of the group's cultural
   identity. Collective beliefs were defined as those beliefs which are a
   function of the group, encompassing more than those beliefs that are
   shared by the individuals within the group.
   Following the experiment it was proposed that it is not necessary for
   members of a group to have a complete set of shared beliefs in order to
   function as a decision-making group. In the new model, collective
   cognitions are described as merely transitory phenomena, changing in
   response to circumstances. The reforming of such phenomena over time
   results in the formation of shared belief systems. This framework was
   supported by the literature.},

Abstract = {This paper presents an economic analysis of religious behavior that
   accounts for the continuing success of groups with strange requirements
   and seemingly inefficient prohibitions.  The analysis does not
   presuppose any special motives for religious activity.  Rather, religion
   is modeled as a club good that displays positive returns to
   ``participatory crowding.{''}  The analysis demonstrates that efficient
   religions with perfectly rational members may benefit from stigma,
   self-sacrifice, and bizarre behavioral restrictions.  The model also
   addresses sacrifice in nonreligious ``social clubs{''}:  fraternities,
   communes, political parties, work groups, and families.},

   assumed that all labor disputes take the form of a strike.  Yet a

   negotiations often continue without a strike after the contract has
   expired.  Production continues with workers paid according to the
   expired contract.  We analyze the union's decision to strike or hold out
   and highlight its importance to strike activity.  Strikes are more
   likely to occur after a drop in the real wage or a decline in

Month = {MAR-APR},
Abstract = {In the 1980s, companies discovered time as a new source of competitive
   advantage.  In the 1990s, they will discover that time is only one piece
   of a more far-reaching transformation in the logic of competition. 
   Using examples from Wal-Mart and other highly successful companies,
   Stalk, Evans, and Shulman of the Boston Consulting Group provide
   managers with a guide to the new world of ``capabilities-based
   competition.{''}
   In today's dynamic business environment, strategy too must become
   dynamic.  Competition is a ``war of movement{''} in which success
   depends on anticipation of market trends and quick response to changing
   customer needs.  In such an environment, the essence of strategy is not
   the structure of a company's products and markets but the dynamics of
   its behavior.  To succeed, a company must weave its key business
   processes into hard-to-imitate strategic capabilities that distinguish
   it from its competitors in the eyes of customers.
   A capability is a set of business processes strategically understood-for
   example, Wal-Mart's expertise in inventory replenishment, Honda's skill
   at dealer management, or Banc One's ability to ``out-local the national
   banks and out-national the local banks.{''}  Such capabilities are
   collective and cross-functional- a small part of many people's jobs, not
   a large part of a few.  Finally, competing on capabilities requires
   strategic investments in support systems that span traditional SBUs and
   functions and go far beyond what traditional cost-benefit metrics can
   justify.
   A CEO's success in building and managing a company's capabilities will
   be the chief test of management skill in the 1990s.  The prize: 
   companies that combine scale and flexibility to outperform the
   competition.},

Journal = {HARVARD BUSINESS REVIEW},
Year = {1992},
Volume = {70},
Number = {2},

Month = {MAR-APR},
Abstract = {Managers and leaders are two very different types of people.  Managers'
   goals arise out of necessities rather than desires; they excel at
   diffusing conflicts between individuals or departments, placating all
   sides while ensuring that an organization's day to day business gets
   done.  Leaders, on the other hand, adopt personal, active attitudes
   towards goals.  They look for the potential opportunities and rewards
   that lie around the corner, inspiring subordinates and firing up the
   creative process with their own energy.  Their relationships with
   employees and coworkers are intense, and their working environment is
   often, consequently, chaotic.
   Business need both managers and leaders to survive and succeed.  But in
   larger U.S. organizations, a ``managerial mystique{''} seems to have
   taken hold that perpetuates the development of managerial
   personalities-people who rely on, and strive to maintain, orderly,
   stable, work patterns.  The managerial power ethic favors collective
   leadership and seeks to avoid risk.
   That same ``managerial mystique{''} stifles the development of
   leaders-how can an entrepreneurial spirit develop when it is submerged
   in a conservative environment and denied personal attention?  Mentor
   relationships are crucial to the development of leadership
   personalities, but in large, bureaucratic organizations, such
   relationships are not encouraged.
   Business must find ways to train good managers and develop leaders at
   the same time.  Without a solid organizational framework, even leaders
   with the most brilliant of ideas may spin their wheels, frustrating
   coworkers and accomplishing little.  But without the entrepreneurial
   culture that develops when a leader is at the helm of an organization, a
   business will stagnate, and rapidly lose competitive power.},

Volume = {7},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Having being involved in management operations overseas, many executives
   have come to the conclusion that cultural differences influence the
   relative performance of companies in different countries.  This
   managerial gut feeling has been supported by academic research, which
   has shown that cultural forces influence the strategies and structures
   that firms use.  However, one aspect of this cross-cultural research
   that has gotten little academic research attention is the relationship
   between cultural values and the innovativeness and inventiveness of a
   society.  This study examines this relationship.
   Two aspects of culture should have an influence on inventiveness.  The
   first-the extent to which a society stresses social hierarchy-should
   decrease inventiveness for a number of reasons.  Inventiveness is more
   likely to occur if a society is less hierarchical since bureaucracy
   reduces creative activity.  Communication enhances invention because
   much of people's inventive activity requires input from others.  In
   hierarchical societies, there is less communication between superiors
   and subordinates than in non-hierachical societies.  Innovation requires
   decentralized authority because such a structure brings more information
   to the attention of the senior managers and gives employees greater
   incentive, and hierarchical societies tend to have more centralized
   authority.  Hierarchical societies tend to have control systems based
   less on trust, and more on rules and procedures, and these controls
   inhibit creativity and inventiveness.  Inventiveness is hard work and
   requires a strong work ethic, and hierarchical societies are more
   fatalistic and less inclined to undertake the hard work necessary for
   innovation.  Finally, inventions often cause radical social change. 
   Hierarchical societies seek to minimize this change because the
   redistribution of power that accompanies social change might cause those
   at the top of the hierarchy to fall.
   Individualistic societies should be more inventive than collectivistic
   ones.  Individualistic societies value freedom more than collectivistic
   societies, and freedom is necessary for creativity.  Inventiveness
   requires an outward-looking view.  Individualistic societies do not
   stress loyalty to the extent that collectivistic societies do, so they
   are able to gather more information necessary for invention.  Small
   firms are more innovative than large ones, and people in individualistic
   societies tend to prefer small firms, whereas those in collectivistic
   societies prefer large ones.  Inventors need to be compensated for their
   inventions monetarily and with recognition.  This is more likely in
   individualistic societies, which are more willing to single people out. 
   The support of senior people in organizations is necessary for
   innovation to occur, and people in individualistic societies are more
   likely to seek this support.  Finally, the psychological characteristics
   of independence, achievement, and non-conformity, which have been found
   to encourage innovation, are all more common in individualistic
   societies.
   This study examined the per capita number of invention patents granted
   to nationals of 33 countries in 1967, 1971, 1976, and 1980 and compared
   it with an index of the values of power distance (social hierarchy) and
   individualism, compiled from a survey of 88,000 employees at IBM
   undertaken by Geert Hofstede in the late 1960s and early 1970s.  The
   results showed that individualistic and non-hierarchical societies are
   more inventive than other societies.
   The findings have two implications for managers.  First, some societies
   might have a cultural comparative advantage in inventiveness.  If this
   is true, these countries are the best locations for research and
   development in multinational corporations.  Second, the same cultural
   values that operate on the national level operate on the firm level,
   leading companies and countries with innovative cultures to invent more
   than others.},

   interlocutors. Crises and conflicts in these environments were
   important. Hence separately, Olsonian logic (referring to the logic of

   short of explaining BIAs. Their combination is required.},

Abstract = {This paper presents a succinct review of the movement for moral genesis
   in business that arose in the 1970s. The moral genesis movement is
   characterized by: (a) the rejection of the premise that business and
   ethics are antagonistic; (b) the rise of the Issues Management approach,
   which stresses the social responsibility of the corporation: (c) disdain
   of government regulation as a means of business moralization, and (d) a
   search for control measures aimed at improving organization moral
   behavior. This movement now begins to give rise to a new organizational
   model, the ``Self-Moralizing Corporation,{''} which transcends existing
   paradigms of corporate rectitude. The tenets of the ``Self-Moralizing
   Corporation{''} are that: (a) the moral behavior of members is a
   requisite to the attainment of organization goals; (b) individual moral
   behavior is an asset which must be managed and developed by the
   corporation; (c) individual moral development is a collectively and
   individually shared responsibility; and, (d) the maintenance of moral
   values is more important than the preservation of organization

Abstract = {We consider the problem of fair allocation in economies with indivisible

   look for solutions satisfying them: given an allocation chosen by a
   solution for some economy and given a subgroup of the agents, consider
   the problem of fairly distributing among its members the resources that
   this group has collectively received. The solution is consistent if it
   recommends that the same bundle be attributed to each of these agents as
   initially. We show that there is no proper subsolution of the no-envy
   solution that satisfies consistency. However, many subsolutions satisfy
   bilateral consistency or the converse of consistency. But again, there
   is no proper subsolution satisfying these two properties together.},

Abstract = {This paper proposes a methodology for evaluating and selecting R\&D
   projects in a collective decision setting, especially useful at
   sectorial and national levels.  It consists of two major phases: 
   Evaluation and Selection.  The evaluation process repeately uses
   mathematical programming models to determine the ``relative values{''}
   of a given R\&D project from the viewpoint of the other R\&D projects. 
   The selection process of R\&D projects is based on these ``relative
   values{''} and is done through a model-based outranking method.
   The salient features of the methodology developed are its ability to (1)
   permit the evaluation of an R\&D project from the viewpoint of the other
   R\&D projects without at first imposing a uniform evaluation scheme, and
   (2) maximize the level of consensus as to which projects should not be
   retained in the R\&D Program being funded, thus minimizing the level of
   possible resentment in those organizations or departments whose projects
   are not included in the R\&D Program.
   Also discussed in this paper is an application of the methodology to
   evaluate and select major R\&D projects in the iron and steel industry
   of Turkey.},
