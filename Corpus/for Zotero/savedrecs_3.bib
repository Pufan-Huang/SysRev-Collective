Abstract = {Research on whistle-blowing in the Norwegian public sector shows
   remarkable findings compared with international research. A very high
   proportion of employees blow the whistle when they experience
   misconduct, and the majority of these people receive positive reactions.
   Furthermore, a majority of the whistle-blowers report that the conduct
   that led them to blow the whistle improved. These positive findings are
   different from those reported in international research displaying that
   whistle-blowing is difficult, often results in retaliation and is rarely
   effective. This article seeks to shed light on the positive Norwegian
   experiences, first by exploring how power resources can help us
   understand the extent and types of whistle-blowing, the consequences for
   the whistle-blower and the effectiveness of the practice. Second, the
   article asks whether a Norwegian model of labour relations promotes a
   communicative `culture' where employees can freely voice their opinions
   and critical remarks, and report misconduct. The findings show that
   power resources to a little degree can explain whistle-blowing activity
   and its results. It is plausible to assume that the strong emphasis on
   collective arrangements and laws reduces the impact of an individual
   employee's power resources by making the reporting process less
   arbitrary. Furthermore, it could be argued that the Norwegian model
   establishes structures for a communication culture that facilitates
   whistle-blowing.},

Abstract = {We examine how residents of the United States allocate their stock
   portfolios internationally. We find that a large U. S. Foreign Direct
   Investment (FDI) position in a destination country in 1990 is associated
   with a relatively large stock portfolio position in that country in the
   2001-2006 period. Moreover, a change in the U.S. FDI position from 1980
   to 1990 helps predict the change in the U.S. Foreign Portfolio
   Investment position from 1994 to 2006. These results are rationalized by
   Van Nieuwerburgh and Veldkamp's (2009) equilibrium model of learning and
   portfolio choice under an information processing constraint. FDI
   establishes marginal differences in the endowments of information about
   different countries, which later translate into differences in stock
   portfolio holdings. We control for cross-country differences in capital
   controls, proximity along different dimensions, corporate governance,
   and economic and capital market development. Our results also hold for
   the G6 countries collectively.},

Abstract = {This research investigates the effects of across-consumer price
   comparisons on perceived price fairness as a function of culture.
   Collectivist (Chinese) consumers are more sensitive to in-group versus
   out-group differences than individualist (U.S.) consumers. The
   collectivist perspective orients consumers toward the in-group and
   heightens concerns about ``face{''} (i.e., status earned in a social
   network) that arise from in-group comparisons. Process evidence for the
   causal role of cultural differences derives from manipulated
   self-construal and measurement of the emotional role of shame evoked by
   face concerns. Finally, in a robustness test, an alternative
   operationalization of the in-group/out-group distinction extends the
   findings to the context of firm relationships.},

Abstract = {This article investigates where financial participation is most likely
   to be encountered, and explores its compatibility with collective forms
   of employee voice. It is based on the findings of a major international
   survey of human resource management (HRM) practices. We found that
   financial participation was not affected by collective employee voice,
   but that national context and associated HRM strategies had significant
   effects on its nature and extent. As financial participation is likely
   to make for greater variation in wage rates, it tends to weaken
   industry-level bargaining. By re-casting the fundamental determinants of
   wages, it is also likely to facilitate greater wage dispersion within
   the firm. Hence, it was found that financial participation is more
   commonly encountered in liberal market contexts, and in firms practising
   calculative HRM, where countervailing employee power is weak, whether or
   not collective bargaining is formally present.},

Abstract = {Within the context of environmental voluntary agreements (VAs), this
   paper analyzes the determinants of the degree of participation by firms
   in collective corporate political strategies that aim to shape
   government policy. We demonstrate that substantive cooperative
   strategies are more likely to be pursued by firms that enter a VA close
   to its initiation, while symbolic cooperation is more likely behavior by
   late joiners. We show that late joiners and early joiners within VAs
   adopt different cooperative strategies because they face different
   institutional pressures. Our analysis is based on the strategies of
   firms participating in the Climate Challenge program (1995-2000)
   established by the U.S. Department of Energy and representatives of the
   national electric utilities to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Our
   results show that early joiners were subjected to higher levels of
   political pressure at the state level and were more dependent on local
   and federal regulatory agencies than late joiners were. Early joiners
   were also better connected to the trade association and more visible.
   Late joiners had undertaken significantly less investment in
   environmental improvements than early joiners. Our paper also
   illustrates the difficulty involved in using VAs to try to induce
   improved environmental outcomes when there are no sanctioning
   mechanisms. Although early entrants reduced their emissions more than
   nonparticipants, our results show no significant difference overall
   between participants and nonparticipants in the reduction of their
   emissions. Copyright (C) 2010 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Journal = {ADMINISTRATIVE SCIENCE QUARTERLY},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {55},
Number = {2},
Pages = {222-254},

Abstract = {This paper theorizes and tests how chief executive officers' (CEOs')
   transformational leadership behaviors, which motivate followers to do
   more than expected and act for the good of the collective, influence
   followers' commitment. We theorize that CEOs' values may either enhance
   or attenuate the effect of transformational behaviors on followers,
   depending on followers' reactions to the congruence or incongruence
   between leaders' internal values and their outward transformational
   behaviors. Self-enhancement values-focusing on the leader's own
   happiness-would attenuate the effect, whereas self-transcendent
   values-focusing on others' happiness-would accentuate the effect of
   CEOs' transformational behaviors on followers' commitment. Using a
   sample of 45 managers in two companies in China, we validated a Q-sort
   method of measuring personal values. Results of a second study using
   cross-sectional and longitudinal surveys as well as interview data from
   a sample of Chinese CEOs, top managers, and middle managers supported
   both the attenuation and the accentuation effects and validated the idea
   that middle managers can detect their CEOs' values.(circle)},

   an incentive to use the cash flow demands of debt service to improve its
   bargaining position with workers. Using both firm-level collective
   bargaining coverage and state changes in labor laws to identify changes
   in union bargaining power, I show that strategic incentives from union
   bargaining appear to have a substantial impact on corporate financing

Abstract = {This paper analyzes the effect of university research centers on the
   productivity and collaboration patterns of university faculty.
   University research centers are an important subject for policy analysis
   insofar that they have become the predominant policy response to
   scientific and technical demands that have not been met by extant
   institutions, including academic departments, private firms, and
   government laboratories. Specifically, these centers aim to organize
   researchers from across the disciplines and sectors which, collectively
   as a research unit, possess the scientific and technical capacity
   relevant to scientific and technical goals of the sponsoring agencies.
   In this paper, we measure the productivity and collaboration patterns of
   university researchers affiliated with a relatively large-scale and
   ``mature{''} university research center to discern the effects, if any,
   of the center mechanism on individual scientists and engineers. Based on
   an analysis of longitudinal bibliometric data, the results from this
   case study demonstrate affiliation with the center to be effective at
   enhancing overall productivity as well as at facilitating
   cross-discipline, cross-sector, and inter-institutional productivity and
   collaborations. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Through a convenience sample of 260 employees, the study shows how
   employees' perceptions about corporate citizenship (CC) predict their
   affective commitment. The study was carried out in Portugal, a high
   in-group and low societal collectivistic culture. Maignan et al.'s
   (1999, Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science 27(4), 455-469)
   construct, including economic, legal, ethical, and discretionary
   responsibilities was used. The main findings are: (a) contrary to what
   has been presumed in the literature, the discretionary dimension
   includes two factors: CC toward employees and toward community; (b)
   perceptions of CC explain 35\% of unique variance of affective
   commitment; (c) the best predictors are perceptions of economic and
   legal CC and, mainly, perceptions of discretionary CC toward employees;
   (d) the perceptions of discretionary CC toward employees are
   significantly better predictors of affective commitment than are
   perceptions of economic, ethical, and discretionary CC toward the
   community; (e) perceived inconsistency of the several CC dimensions is
   detrimental to employees' affective commitment. The study questions the
   four-dimensional model of the CC construct as operationalized by Maignan
   et al., suggests that culture should be included as a moderating
   variable in future research, and stresses that affective commitment may
   decrease when employees perceive that their organizations act upon the
   several areas of CC inconsistently.},

Abstract = {P>We investigated the relationship between middle managers'
   transformational leadership and the performance of frontline employees
   who are two levels below the middle managers. We identified two pathways
   through which this cross-level influence occurs and tested two
   moderators operating on these two pathways. The first pathway is a
   direct effect from middle managers to employees, bypassing the influence
   of employees' immediate supervisor (the bypass effect). We further
   hypothesized that the bypass effect is moderated by the employees'
   collectivistic value. The second pathway is a cascading of leadership
   behaviours from middle managers to first-line supervisors, whose
   transformational leadership then enhances employees' performance (the
   cascading effect). We further hypothesized that this cascading effect is
   moderated by the supervisors' power distance value. These hypotheses
   were tested with a sample of 491 frontline employees, 98 frontline
   supervisors, and 30 middle managers in three organizations in China. The
   three-level hierarchical linear modelling results supported the four
   hypotheses.},

   Evidence from Professional Financial Services Across Cultures},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MARKETING},

Volume = {74},
Number = {3},

Abstract = {Emergent perspectives in marketing highlight new opportunities for
   co-opting customers as a means to define and cocreate value through
   their participation. This study delineates and empirically tests
   hypotheses regarding the effects of customer participation (CP) on value
   creation and satisfaction for both customers and employees with
   different cultural value orientations in the context of professional
   financial services. Using data collected from 349 pairs of customers and
   service employees in two national groups (Hong Kong and the United
   States) of a global financial institution, this study examines how (1)
   CP drives performance outcomes (i.e., customer satisfaction, employee
   job satisfaction, and employee job performance) through the creation of
   economic and relational values and (2) the effects of CP on value
   creation depend on participants' cultural value orientations. Promoting
   OP could be a double-edged sword for firms: OP enhances customers'
   economic value attainment and strengthens the relational bond between
   customers and employees, but it also increases employees' job stress and
   hampers their job satisfaction. Moreover, the effects of OP on value
   creation depend on the cultural values of both customers and service
   employees; this result implies that arranging customers and service
   employees with ``matched{''} cultural value orientations could
   facilitate the creation of value through CP.},

Abstract = {With the rapid increase in the application of Western HR practices in
   emerging markets, it is crucial to investigate how non-Western employees
   react to Western HR practices such as pay for performance (PFP). We
   investigate employee reactions to PFP in emerging markets using China as
   a case. Our multilevel analyses, based on data from 574 engineers in 22
   domestic firms and eight foreign firms in China, demonstrated that PFP
   was positively associated with conscientiousness at the individual
   level. In contrast, PFP was negatively related to employees'
   organizational commitment and interpersonal helping at the organization
   level. This study suggests that the impact of ``culture distance{''}
   associated with Western HR practices may be more likely to manifest
   itself in the collective entity than at the individual level. Employees
   of domestic firms reported significantly higher levels of performance
   appraisal satisfaction and justice perceptions than employees of foreign
   firms, which might explain why PFP was more widely implemented in
   domestic firms in China. The present results demonstrated that, in
   addition to the culture distance, the ``context distance{''} between
   domestic and foreign firms may play a critical role in accruing benefits
   from PFP, indicating that PFP can be more beneficial to domestic firms
   than to foreign firms. The present findings provide practical
   implications for foreign firms operating in emerging markets. Journal of
   International Business Studies (2010), 41, 671-689.

Abstract = {P>We discuss and examine recent claims that research on knowledge
   processes has paid insufficient attention to micro (individual) level
   constructs and mechanisms and to the role of formal organization in
   governing knowledge processes. We review knowledge sharing research
   published in 13 (top academic plus top practitioner-oriented) journals
   in the period 1996-2006 in relation to these two propositions. The
   review confirms the claim that the knowledge sharing literature is
   preoccupied with constructs, processes, and phenomena defined at a macro
   (collective, organizational) level and pay comparatively little
   attention to micro level constructs. The review provides less support
   for the proposition that formal governance mechanisms have been
   under-researched in comparison to formal organization. Still, the
   multiple ways in which formal governance mechanisms may interact in
   influencing knowledge sharing outcomes have been under-researched, as
   has the interaction between more informal aspects of the firm and formal
   governance mechanisms. We argue that future research on knowledge
   sharing needs to fill these gaps.},

Pages = {393-435},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {This paper investigates whether there are systematic differences between
   the forecasting style and abilities of female and male analysts, and
   whether market participants recognize these differences. My key
   conjecture is that only female analysts with superior forecasting
   abilities enter the profession due to a perception of discrimination in
   the analyst labor market. Consistent with this conjecture, I find that
   female analysts issue bolder and more accurate forecasts and their
   accuracy is higher in market segments in which their concentration is
   lower. Further, the stock market participants are aware of the
   male-female skill differences. They respond more strongly to the
   forecast revisions by female analysts even though those analysts get
   less media coverage. The short-term market reaction is incomplete,
   however, because it is followed by a strong post-revision drift. The
   perception of abilities is similar in the analyst labor market, where
   female analysts are more likely to move up to high-status brokerage
   firms, while their downward career mobility is lower. Collectively,
   these results indicate that female analysts have better-than-average
   skill due to self-selection and market participants are at least
   partially able to recognize their superior abilities.},

Abstract = {Sustainable investment (SI), which integrates social, environmental and
   ethical issues, has grown from a niche market of individual ethical
   investors to embrace institutional investors (e.g. pension funds)
   resulting in A 764 pound billion in assets under management in the UK
   alone {[}Eurosif, 2008: `European SRI Study 2008' (Eurosif, Paris)].
   Explaining this growth is complex, involving shifts in personal and
   collective values, reactions to corporate scandals, scientific and media
   pronouncements about climate change, Government initiatives, responses
   from financial markets and the influence of SI innovators in The City of
   London. The article examines the influence of human agency through
   interviews with 14 SI champions who have variously been responsible for
   launching SI funds and changing investment processes and organisational
   structures in order to enhance SI. Interviewees were asked about their
   motivations and persuasive strategies, the obstacles they faced and how
   they overcame them as well as broader implications of SI for financial
   markets. The following key categories inform the results and the
   discussion: Values; Conservatism, Antipathy and Incredulity; Optimism
   and Sympathy from Insiders; The Social and Political Context; The
   Business Case; Organisational Constraints; Inappropriate forms of
   Remuneration; Short-termism; The Nature of Capitalism. Three discourses
   were also identified. The first is the necessity to make a business case
   for SI; the second is the benefits that SI can bring to the quest of
   overcoming short-termism; the third is a belief that for SI to have a
   significant influence, greater government intervention is required.},

Abstract = {This study provides insight into the importance of national culture,
   investment in operations, and performance in the context of emerging
   Asian economies with a collectivist orientation, which are compared to
   industrialized Western nations with an individualist orientation.
   Hypotheses are developed and tested based on the cultural concept of
   individualism/collectivism, the theory of performance frontiers, and the
   extent of economic development. More specifically, data collected from
   639 manufacturing plants in nine countries are used to first assess the
   influence of the cultural trait of individualism/collectivism on the
   extent of investment in structural assets (specifically: physical and
   capital-based) and infrastructural assets (specifically: team-based
   methods and improvement programs). Second, the influence of the extent
   of economic development on these investment factors is measured. Third,
   evidence is provided supportive of the theory of performance frontiers,
   and the nature of resource investments in the context of the cultural
   construct of individualism/collectivism. And fourth, support is provided
   for the efficacy of this theory, as well as for its compatibility and
   association with the resource-based view of the firm. Overall, this
   study makes important contributions to both theory and practice, and
   provides evidence for the role played by the cultural characteristic of
   individualism/collectivism in determining plant level investment
   outcomes in emerging Asian economies. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {This paper sequentially addresses a conceptual and an empirical goal.
   Our conceptual goal was to develop a globally relevant model of the
   relationship between work role stressors and strain using conservation
   of resources (COR) theory as our foundation. Stressors included in the
   model are role conflict and role ambiguity, with three resources -
   mastery, optimistic orientation, and self-esteem - as moderators on the
   stressor-strain relationship. With this conceptual framework developed,
   we explored our empirical goal, a test of the model using both
   societal-level and individual-level indicators. First, we pan-culturally
   tested the model across our seven-society sample. Next, we split these
   societies into high and low gross national income categories. Likewise,
   we split the respondents in our sample, regardless of their country,
   into high and low idiocentrism/individualism and
   allocentrism/collectivism categories and tested at these group levels.
   Our findings showed that personal resources - mastery, optimistic
   orientation, and self-esteem - generally served to buffer the
   experienced strain due to work role ambiguity and conflict. This study
   provides specific information that can assist the global business

Abstract = {To supplement the extant mentoring literature that has taken a
   predominantly Western/U.S. perspective, the present study examined the
   nature of mentoring relationships in a highly power-distant and
   collectivistic culture such as India. Twenty-nine Indian masters of
   business administration (MBA) students participated in a qualitative
   study (using in-depth interviews) regarding Indian conceptualizations of
   mentors, the dynamics of mentoring relationships, their mentoring
   experiences in India, and the practice of mentoring as a career
   management tool. Content analysis revealed that while some aspects of
   mentoring seem culturally invariant, other aspects might be influenced
   by careers and socio-cultural contexts. The findings are discussed from
   relational and cultural perspectives with theoretical and practical
   implications for cross-cultural management and human resource practice.

Abstract = {This paper combines dynamic social choice and strategic experimentation
   to study the following question: How does a society, a committee, or,
   more generally, a group of individuals with potentially heterogeneous
   preferences, experiment with new opportunities? Each voter recognizes
   that, during experimentation, other voters also learn about their
   preferences. As a result, pivotal voters today are biased against
   experimentation because it reduces their likelihood of remaining
   pivotal. This phenomenon reduces equilibrium experimentation below the
   socially efficient level, and may even result in a negative option value
   of experimentation. However, one can restore efficiency by designing a
   voting rule that depends deterministically on time. Another main result
   is that even when payoffs of a reform are independently distributed
   across the population, good news about any individual's payoff increases
   other individuals' incentives to experiment with that reform, due to a
   positive voting externality.},

   repertoires. Individual disengagement diverts inquiry and disrupts
   inquiry-action linkages, creating lapses that degenerate learning.
   Within these extremes, instances of individual faltering are evident

Abstract = {Increasing globalization has created tremendous opportunities and
   challenges for organizations and societies. Consequently, a broad range
   of information technologies to better support the collaboration of
   diverse, and increasingly distributed, sets of participants is ever more
   utilized. Arguably, the success of such technology-mediated
   collaboration is dependent upon the quality of each individual's
   contributions; however, although individuals' motivations to do their
   best could be significantly influenced by the design of a system's
   human-computer interface, this area has received little attention within
   the context of group collaboration environments. We fill this gap by
   integrating research from human-computer interaction, motivation, and
   technology-supported group work to theoretically derive mechanisms for
   increasing each individual's motivation within a collective setting.
   Specifically, we manipulate the interface of a computer-mediated idea
   generation system (a widely used collaboration tool) to enhance the
   system's motivational affordance, i.e., the system's properties that
   fulfill users' motivational needs. Results from two studies demonstrate
   that by embedding the theoretically derived mechanisms ``providing
   feedback{''} and ``designing for optimal challenge{''} into the
   collaboration environment, significant performance gains were realized.
   The results suggest that even slight manipulations of the human-computer
   interface can contribute significantly to the successful design of a
   wide variety of group collaboration environments.},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {While temporality is generally acknowledged as a critical ingredient in
   processes of identity formation, studies of identity talk usually assume
   collective identity is essentially about establishing or facilitating a
   sense of temporal self-continuity. These studies do not detail how
   organizational actors might recast their identity narratives and
   reflectively put together stories about a changing or changed identity.
   The ethnographic research presented in this article reports how the
   editors of a Dutch national newspaper constructed their newspaper's
   identity in temporal discontinuity talk, discursively constructing a
   contrast between the `old' and the `new', between legacies from a common
   past and plans for the future. As the organizational identity literature
   is primarily focused on talk of temporal continuities, I draw on studies
   of organizational change and nostalgic and `postalgic' narratives in
   order to develop an understanding of the temporal dimension of
   collective identity talk that does not rule out, but incorporates,
   discontinuity and change.},

Abstract = {How do elite policy-making groups make sense of complex and ambiguous

   process based in shared narrative construction. It is a social process

   approved models to the current conditions to establish relevant facts
   and events; plotting, the reordering of those facts and events into a
   plausible narrative; and selective retention, the collective negotiation
   of a policy choice that fits the emerging narrative. This paper uses
   verbatim transcripts of meetings at the Federal Reserve to explore how
   policy makers use a logic of appropriateness to identify relevant cues
   and integrate them with existing models by weaving sensible plots. These
   plots are designed to control the supply of money and credit and
   maintain the legitimacy of the central bank.},

Abstract = {This study investigates the willingness of workers in a unionized
   environment to participate in a joint consultation committee (JCC). It
   focuses on the differences between union members and non-members. We
   derived hypotheses from a consumer services theoretical approach to
   participation in collective activities. Using hierarchical regression,
   we analysed the survey responses of 1456 employees in a large Australian
   public sector organization. Members were more willing to participate in
   the JCC the more they expected instrumental outcomes and the more they
   valued discussion of issues that lay outside collective bargaining. They
   were less willing to participate the more they valued discussions about
   issues normally dealt with in union-based negotiations. Nonmembers were
   more willing to participate, the more they expected the JCC to result in
   democratic representation.},

Abstract = {This study shows that firms collectively incur a cost for managing
   earnings and analyst expectations to meet earnings forecasts. We compare
   the coefficient in the regression of abnormal stock returns on earnings
   surprise (the earnings response coefficient {[}ERC]) across ranges of
   earnings surprises. The ERC for earnings surprises in the range {[}0,
   1(sic)] is significantly lower than ERCs for earnings surprises in
   adjacent ranges for firm-quarters in the early and mid 2000s, but not
   for those in the 1990s. The results are robust to controlling for the
   sign of estimated discretionary accruals and the trajectory of analyst
   earnings forecasts. We further find that investors are right to be
   skeptical about earnings surprises in the range {[}0, 1(sic)]. The
   relation of future earnings surprise with current earnings surprise is
   more negative for current earnings surprises in that range than for
   those in any other range. Evidence also suggests analysts react
   negatively to earnings surprises in that range.},

Abstract = {This article explores the effects of team voice and worker
   representative voice, as well as their interaction, on labor
   productivity. We examine team voice in terms of team influence on key
   work-related issues and representative voice via the degree of worker
   representatives' influence on multiple collective voice issues. We thus
   build on the European tradition of examining both direct and indirect
   voice and their implications for valued organizational outcomes. We find
   that neither type of voice bears a significant relationship to labor
   productivity when examined solely but that team voice significantly
   contributes to enhanced worker efficiency when considered in conjunction
   with representative voice. In examining the interaction of the two types
   of voice, we find that a combination of low team and low representative
   voice leads to inferior labor efficiency compared to other conditions.
   We also find a negative interaction between team voice and worker
   representative voice, supporting an interpretation that these types of
   voice do not complement each other with respect to worker productivity.
   The positive impact of each type of voice is significantly stronger at
   low levels of the other type of voice.},

Abstract = {Employee voice has been an enduring theme within the employment
   relations literature. This article profiles the incidence of a range of
   direct and indirect employee voice mechanisms within multinational
   companies (MNCs) and, using an analytical framework, identifies a number
   of different approaches to employee voice. Drawing from a highly
   representative sample of MNCs in Ireland, we point to quite a
   significant level of engagement with all types of employee voice, both
   direct and indirect. Using the analytical framework, we find that the
   most common approach to employee voice was an indirect voice approach
   (i.e. the use of trade unions and/or non-union structures of collective
   employee representation). The regression analysis identifies factors
   such as country of origin, sector, the European Union Directive on
   Information and Consultation and date of establishment as having varying
   impacts on the approaches adopted by MNCs to employee voice.},

Abstract = {This study examined how brokers on creative projects integrate the ideas
   of others. We use the term ``nexus work{''} to refer to brokerage
   requiring synthesis or integration, rather than just communication or
   transference of ideas. With an ethnographic investigation of 23
   independent music producers in the Nashville country music industry, we
   examined how producers in the brokerage role fostered the integration of
   others' contributions throughout four phases of the creative process. We
   discovered that ambiguity was an inherent part of the collective
   creative process and identified three types: (1) an ambiguous quality
   metric (What makes a hit or constitutes success?); (2) ambiguous
   occupational jurisdictions (Whose claim of expertise entitles them to
   control the process?); and (3) an ambiguous transformation process (How
   should the work be done?). We show when each type of ambiguity became
   acute in the creative process and identify the practices producers used
   to leverage their brokerage role depending on the type of ambiguity
   confronted. In doing so, producers moved between two ideal conceptions
   of brokerage-as strategic actors extracting advantage from their
   position and as relational experts connecting others to foster
   creativity and innovation-to foster a collective creative
   outcome.(circle)},

Abstract = {Despite scholars' and practitioners' recognition that different forms of
   workplace harassment often co-occur in organizations, there is a paucity
   of theory and research on how these different forms of harassment
   combine to influence employees' outcomes. We investigated the ways in
   which ethnic harassment (EH), gender harassment (GH), and generalized
   workplace harassment (GWH) combined to predict target individuals'
   job-related, psychological, and health outcomes. Competing theories
   regarding additive, exacerbating, and inuring (i.e., habituating to
   hardships) combinations were tested. We also examined race and gender
   differences in employees' reports of EH, OH, and GWH. The results of two
   studies revealed that EH, OH, and GWH were each independently associated
   with targets' strain outcomes and, collectively, the preponderance of
   evidence supported the inurement effect, although slight additive
   effects were observed for psychological and physical health outcomes.
   Racial group differences in EH emerged, but gender and race differences
   in OH and GWH did not. Implications are provided for how multiple
   aversive experiences at work may harm employees' well-being.},

Journal = {ORGANIZATION STUDIES},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {31},
Number = {3},
Pages = {307-326},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {This paper compares the Italian Renaissance painter Caravaggio's two
   versions of the Conversion of Saint Paul (1600/1601) with two modern
   models of organization. These comparisons show how organization is
   produced in art through `aesthetic landscaping' (Gagliardi 2006), and in
   particular how these artistic reproductions convey certain images of the
   appropriate modern, entrepreneurial self and regimes of organization.
   The painting was originally commissioned by the Catholic Church, but it
   rejected the first and accepted the second version. The paper claims
   that this strategy strengthens the given organization of the Church and
   the Church's strategic influence on the believers that adore the
   painting. But this all comes with a price, namely, the production of a
   number of strict divisions: in the accepted version, Paul becomes a pure
   transcendent spirit. Isolated from his surroundings, his servant and his
   horse, he is cut off from the very event of conversion. The rejected
   version harbours radically different, transgressive images of
   subjectivity, collectivity and entrepreneurship. By identifying these
   images, the paper contributes to the development of a critical approach

Title = {Power Asymmetry and Learning in Teams: The Moderating Role of
   Performance Feedback},
Journal = {ORGANIZATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {21},
Number = {2},
Pages = {347-361},
Month = {MAR-APR},
Abstract = {Past research suggests that power asymmetry within teams can have a
   stifling effect on team learning and performance. We argue here that
   this effect is contingent on whether power advantages within a team are
   used to advance individual or collective interests. This study considers
   the moderating role of one factor that can influence the individual or
   collective orientation of team members-the type of performance feedback
   that a team receives. We propose that whereas individual feedback
   reinforces the negative effects of power asymmetry on team learning,
   group feedback fosters a collective orientation within a team that
   transforms power differences into a stimulus for team learning. Analysis
   of multisource, multimethod data obtained from 218 individuals in 46
   teams provided support for these hypotheses. Results also suggested that
   team learning mediated the relationship between power asymmetry and team
   performance. These findings suggest that power asymmetry can be a
   resource for and not just an obstacle to team learning in
   power-asymmetric teams.},

Abstract = {This article researches how a corporate code of ethics (CCE) implemented

   improve the effectiveness of the CCE. This method proved to be very
   fruitful. It appeared that continuous systematic attention needed to be
   paid to the CCE after the CCE had been implemented, particularly by
   management. Initiatives from management to start discussions about
   relevant questions of integrity appeared to be also necessary to make
   the topic a ``normal{''} topic which employees were no longer afraid to
   discuss. In this way, the possibility could be created to develop
   collectively a ``practical{''} frame of reference concerning relevant
   questions of integrity that would help employees to make decisions in

Volume = {34},

Pages = {63-85},

Abstract = {What happens to organizations that chase the hottest information
   technologies? This study examines some of the important organizational
   impacts of the fashion phenomenon in IT. An IT fashion is a transitory
   collective belief that an information technology is new, efficient, and
   at the forefront of practice. Using data collected from published
   discourse and annual IT budgets of 109 large companies for a decade, I
   have found that firms whose names were associated with IT fashions in
   the press did not have higher performance, but they had better
   reputation and higher executive compensation in the near term. Companies
   investing in IT in fashion also had higher reputation and executive pay
   but they had lower performance in the short term and then improved
   performance in the long term. These results support a fashion
   explanation for the middle phase diffusion of IT innovations,
   illustrating that following fashion can legitimize organizations and
   their leaders regardless of performance improvement. the findings also
   extend institutional theory from its usual focus on taken-for-granted
   practices to fashion as a novel source of social approval. This study
   suggests that practitioners balance between performance pressure and
   social approval when they confront whatever is hottest in IT.},

Year = {2010},
Volume = {47},
Number = {1},
Pages = {122-133},

Abstract = {This research uses a dual attitudes perspective to offer new insights
   into flattery and its consequences. The authors show that even when
   flattery by marketing agents is accompanied by an obvious ulterior
   motive that leads targets to discount the proffered compliments, the
   initial favorable reaction (the implicit attitude) continues to coexist
   with the discounted evaluation (the explicit attitude). Furthermore, the
   implicit attitude has more influential consequences than the explicit
   attitude, highlighting the possible subtle impact of flattery even when
   a person has consciously corrected for it. The authors also clarify the
   underlying process by showing how and why the discrepancy between the
   implicit and explicit attitudes induced by flattery may be reduced.
   Collectively, the findings from this investigation provide implications
   for both flattery research and the dual attitudes literature.},

Abstract = {This article provides a conceptual underpinning for the study of

   underlying world view (metaphysics) and develop the opposed ideal-types
   of the bricoleur and the engineer. We then explore and propose to
   distinguish two forms of collective bricolage-familiar and
   convention-based-depending on the type of interaction and the nature of
   the conventions employed. Finally, we highlight the tension between
   ideal-typical bricolage and general organizational norms and standards,
   and discuss both the bricoleur's legitimacy and how a bricolage-based
   arrangement might be embedded into an organizational context.},

Journal = {HUMAN RELATIONS},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {63},
Number = {2},
Pages = {219-248},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The literature on ambiguity reflects contradictory views on its value as
   a resource or a problem for organizational action. In this longitudinal
   empirical study of ambiguity about a strategic goal, we examined how
   strategic ambiguity is used as a discursive resource by different
   organizational constituents and how that is associated with collective
   action around the strategic goal. We found four rhetorical positions,
   each of which drew upon strategic ambiguity to construct the strategic
   goal differently according to whether the various constituents were
   asserting their own interests or accommodating wider organizational
   interests. However, we also found that the different constituents
   maintained these four rhetorical positions simultaneously over time,
   enabling them to shift between their own and other's interests rather
   than converging upon a common interest. These findings are used to
   develop a conceptual framework that explains how strategic ambiguity
   might serve as a resource for different organizational constituents to
   assert their own interests whilst also enabling collective
   organizational action, at least of a temporary nature.},

Year = {2010},
Volume = {41},
Number = {2},

Month = {FEB-MAR},
Abstract = {We examine how institutional configurations, not single institutions,
   provide companies with institutional capital. Building on the
   varieties-of-capitalism approach, it is argued that competitive
   advantage in high-tech industries with radical innovation may be
   supported by combinations of certain institutional conditions: lax
   employment protection, weak collective bargaining coverage, extensive
   university training, little occupational training, and a large stock
   market. Furthermore, multinational enterprises engage in ``institutional
   arbitrage'': they allocate their activities so as to benefit from
   available institutional capital. These hypotheses are tested on
   country-level data for 19 OECD economies in the period 1990 to 2003. A
   fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis yields several interesting
   findings. A high share of university graduates and a large stock market
   are complementary institutions leading to strong export performance in
   high-tech. Employment protection is neither conducive nor harmful to
   export performance in high-tech. A high volume of cross-border mergers
   and acquisitions, as a form of institutional arbitrage leading to
   knowledge flows, acts as a functional equivalent to institutions that
   support knowledge production in the home economy. Implications of these
   findings for theory, policy, and the analysis of firm-level behavior are
   developed. Journal of International Business Studies (2010) 41, 246-266.

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Although shared identity occupies a central place in theorizing about
   regional business clusters, there has been little research on the
   processes by which identity is constructed. In particular, little is
   known about the role of imitation and its relationship to social
   interaction in managers' identification with the cluster in which the
   firm is located. Drawing on economic and socio-economic approaches, I
   develop hypotheses concerning the effect of frequency-based and
   trait-based imitation on the strength of identification with the
   cluster. sing data on 146 small business owners in five mature textile
   clusters in southwest Germany, I find that both imitation modes
   strengthen identification, though to varying degrees. Contrary to much
   research on clusters, the regression results indicate that
   identification can be sustained even in the absence of cooperative
   social interaction.},

Abstract = {Work-related cultural differences, which were familiarized by scholars

   understand various forms of cooperation and communication. However, the
   predominant focus of cultural analysis on collectivistic harmony
   prevents us from gaining an understanding of strategy and conflict. In
   an attempt to grasp how conflicts are handled, a political analysis can
   provide new insights. This is illustrated by a comparative study of two
   CEOs who gave public statements concerning management failure: Shouhei

Abstract = {This study addressed the unresolved issue of how differentiated
   leadership (leaders treating individuals within a group differently)
   affects group effectiveness. We developed and tested a group-level model
   involving group-focused and individual-focused leadership using
   three-phased survey data from 70 work groups in eight companies. Results
   showed that differentiated leadership within groups diminished group
   effectiveness through creating divergence in leader identification and
   member self-efficacy and lower group collective efficacy. At the same
   time, group-focused leadership facilitated group identification and
   collective efficacy, which positively contributed to group
   effectiveness. We discuss theoretical and managerial implications of the
   potential cost of differentiated leadership behaviors in groups.},

Year = {2010},
Volume = {95},
Number = {1},
Pages = {32-53},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Major theories of team effectiveness position emergent collective
   cognitive processes as central drivers of team performance. We
   meta-analytically cumulated 231 correlations culled from 65 independent
   studies of team cognition and its relations to teamwork processes,
   motivational states, and performance outcomes. We examined both broad
   relationships among cognition, behavior, motivation, and performance, as
   well as 3 underpinnings of team cognition as potential moderators of
   these relationships. Findings reveal there is indeed a cognitive
   foundation to teamwork; team cognition has strong positive relationships
   to team behavioral process, motivational states, and team performance.
   Meta-analytic regressions further indicate that team cognition explains
   significant incremental variance in team performance after the effects
   of behavioral and motivational dynamics have been controlled. The nature
   of emergence, form of cognition, and content of cognition moderate
   relationships among cognition, process, and performance, as do task
   interdependence and team type. Taken together, these findings not only
   cumulate extant research on team cognition but also provide a new
   interpretation of the impact of underlying dimensions of cognition as a
   way to frame and extend future research.},

Title = {Speaking Up to Higher-Ups: How Supervisors and Skip-Level Leaders
   Influence Employee Voice},
Journal = {ORGANIZATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {21},
Number = {1},
Pages = {249-270},
Month = {JAN-FEB},
Abstract = {In this qualitative research, we enhance understanding of leader
   influences on employee voice perceptions by examining which leaders
   influence these perceptions and why these influences occur. We conducted
   89 interviews in a high-tech multinational corporation with employees at
   multiple levels in two manufacturing and two R\&D units that differed
   significantly on ``speak up{''}-related items on a company-wide employee
   survey. Systematic analysis of the interview data led us to conclude
   that a broad spectrum of leaders from supervisors to senior managers
   influences individual employee voice perceptions in both direct and
   indirect ways. For example, informants referred to ``skip-level
   leaders,{''} those leaders two to five levels above themselves, as
   reasons to view voice as risky or futile nearly as often as they
   referred to immediate bosses. We present evidence related to ``how{''}
   and ``why{''} these patterns of influence occur by reviewing the direct
   and indirect modes of influence identified and by outlining the
   managerial functions that provide occasions for skip-level leaders to
   have direct influences on employee voice perceptions. We also point to
   differences in the specific echelons of leadership that were most
   influential across the units studied. We propose that multilevel,
   multileader influences on voice perceptions result naturally from modern
   work flows, the essential functions performed by skip-level leaders, and
   deep-seated employee attitudes about authority in hierarchical
   organizations. We propose further that differences in which levels of
   skip-level leadership are most critical to employee voice perceptions in
   different units depend on which leaders have the power to handle
   strategic contingencies and to resolve key uncertainties within
   particular work environments. Finally, we delve into the theoretical
   implications of our findings to offer a set of research propositions
   that can be tested in future research. Collectively, our findings point
   to a complex and nuanced picture of multilevel leader influences on
   employee voice perceptions with important practical implications for
   management.},

   Small Manufacturing Organizations},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MARKETING},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {74},
Number = {1},
Pages = {94-107},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {This research addresses three questions: (1) How do salespeople get
   their desired product modifications implemented within organizations?
   (2) What effect does salesperson trustworthiness have on the means they
   adopt to get product modifications implemented? and (3) What are the
   performance outcomes of the modified products? The results from a survey
   of 149 product managers in small manufacturing organizations suggest
   that two influence strategies-rationality and exchange-have a positive
   impact and that two influence strategies-coalition building and upward
   appeal-have an inverse impact on product modification implementation.
   The results also show that salesperson trustworthiness enhances the
   positive effects of rationality and exchange while mitigating the
   inverse effects of coalition building and upward appeal. Finally, the
   results show that product modification implementation has a positive
   effect on the product's performance in the marketplace. Collectively,
   the results suggest that salespeople should adopt the rationality and
   exchange strategies to get their desired product modifications
   implemented while also developing a reputation for trustworthiness and
   that it pays for organizations to listen to their salespeople.},

Title = {Clusters, Chains and Compliance: Corporate Social Responsibility and
   Governance in Football Manufacturing in South Asia},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ETHICS},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {93},
Number = {2},
Pages = {201-222},
Abstract = {A recent concern in the debate on corporate social responsibility (CSR)
   in developing countries relates to the tension between demands for CSR
   compliance found in many global value chains (GVCs) and the search for
   locally appropriate responses to these pressures. In this context, an
   emerging and relatively understudied area of interest relates to small
   firm industrial clusters. Local clusters offer the potential for local
   joint action, and thus a basis for improving local compliance on CSR
   through collective monitoring and local governance. This article
   explores the interrelationship between global governance, exercised
   through GVC ties, and local governance, via cluster institutions, in
   ensuring compliance with CSR pressures. It undertakes a comparative
   analysis of two leading export-oriented football manufacturing clusters
   in South Asia that have both faced common challenges on child labour.
   The article shows that both forms vertical and horizontal governance
   have played a part in shaping the response of the two clusters on child
   labour. Moreover, these two distinct forms of governance have also led
   to quite differentiated outcomes in terms of forms of work organization
   and child labour monitoring. This raises broader questions on how global
   CSR demands can locally be better embedded and the conditions under
   which football stitchers labour in these new work forms.},

Year = {2010},
Volume = {111},
Number = {1},
Pages = {1-12},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Contributions to public goods are premised on the expectation that the
   collective will realize benefit in excess of the value of required
   contributions. However, past research has focused on public goods of
   fixed and known value, for which the added value of the produced public
   good is obvious. Research has largely ignored public goods whose
   eventual value is uncertain at the time contribution decisions are made.
   Two studies explored the effects of outcome variance on individuals'
   contributions to a public good and their reasons for contributing.
   Contributions were negatively affected by loss prospects in the
   distribution of possible outcomes. Further, loss prospects directly
   discouraged contributions because of loss aversion, and indirectly
   discouraged contributions by fueling fears that others would not
   contribute. The negative effects of loss prospects were stronger when
   social uncertainty was low. Implications for social dilemma research and
   the effective management of collective action are discussed. (C) 2009

Abstract = {This research investigates how movie ratings from professional critics,
   amateur communities, and viewers themselves influence key movie
   performance measures (i.e., movie revenues and new movie ratings). Using
   movie-level data, the authors find that high early movie revenues
   enhance subsequent movie ratings. They also find that high advertising
   spending on movies supported by high ratings maximizes the movie's
   revenues. Furthermore, they empirically show that sequel movies tend to
   reap more revenues but receive lower ratings than originals. Using
   individual viewer-level data, this research highlights how viewers' own
   viewing and rating histories and movie communities' collective opinions
   explain viewer satisfaction. The authors find that various aspects of
   these ratings explain viewers' new movie ratings as a measure of viewer
   satisfaction, after controlling for movie characteristics. Furthermore,
   they find that viewers' movie experiences can cause them to become more
   critical in ratings over time. Finally, they find a U-shaped
   relationship between viewers' genre preferences and genre-specific movie
   ratings for heavy viewers.},

   However, while poor rural communities are geographically isolated and

   entrepreneurs. We then explain the community-level conditions that might
   increase the probability of business network effectiveness. The primary
   opportunities that such networks can exploit and their potential
   spillover effects on economic development are also identified. Finally,
   we provide directions for research that can contribute to better public

Abstract = {Organizational Memory Studies (OMS) is limited by its managerialist,
   presentist preoccupation with the utility of memory for knowledge
   management. The dominant model of memory in OMS is that of a storage
   bin. But this model has been rejected by psychologists because it
   overlooks the distinctly human subjective experience of remembering,
   i.e. episodic memory. OMS also fails to take account of the specific
   social and historical contexts of organizational memory. The
   methodological individualism that is prevalent in OMS makes it difficult
   to engage with the rapidly expanding sociological and historical
   literature in social memory studies, where a more social constructionist
   approach to `collective memory' is generally favoured. However, for its
   part social memory studies derived from Maurice Halbwachs neglects
   organizations, focusing primarily on the nation as a mnemonic community.
   From a critical perspective organizations can be seen as appropriating
   society's memory through corporate sites of memory such as historical
   visitor attractions and corporate museums. There is scope for a
   sociological and historical reorientation within OMS, drawing on social
   memory studies and focusing on corporate sites of memory, such as The
   Henry Ford museum complex, as well as the mnemonic role of founders and
   beginnings in organizations. Taking a social constructionist,
   collectivist approach to social remembering in organizations allows
   connections to be made between memory and other research programmes,
   such as organizational culture studies.},

Title = {Managing Under Duress: Ethical Leadership, Social Capital and the
   Civilian Administration of the British Channel Islands During the Nazi
   Occupation, 1940-1945},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ETHICS},
Year = {2010},

Pages = {113-129},
Abstract = {This article focuses on the collective leadership of the civilian
   authorities of the British Channel Islands during the Nazi Occupation
   (1940-1945), and draws lessons from their ethical performance. The first
   part of the article determines that local officials in the Channel
   Islands disposed of operative margins, but that in the interest of
   collaboration these were not always used to the full. This article then
   details institutional factors that contributed to commonalities between
   the two bailiwicks of Jersey and Guernsey, as they faced up to
   occupation. The second part of this article follows up with the
   dissimilarities, one of which is that Guernsey travelled further down
   the road to collaboration than her sister island. Social capital
   depletion is credited as being responsible for this; and this situation
   was further compounded by lack of `ethical leadership'. The final part
   explores the relationship between social capital and leadership ethics,
   suggesting that virtue serves as a catalyst for social capital stock in
   crisis situations. The core research outcome is that ethical leadership
   produces tangible efficiency and moral effects in situations of extreme
   duress (such as Nazi Occupation) where one could have expected very
   little or no scope for such a thing. This is an uplifting message that
   runs counter to scepticism as to the practical value of business ethics.
   Implications are drawn with regard to the challenge of reconciling MNE
   activities with the moral complexity posed by globalization.},

   varies substantially both across and within countries, with large
   increases in the 1980s and 1990s in the Netherlands and the UK and,
   since the mid-1990s, in Germany. The US has the highest incidence of
   low-wage work, with Germany close behind. Denmark and France have much

Abstract = {The ethical governance of the global Internet is an accelerating global
   phenomenon. A key paradox of the global Internet is that it allows
   individual and collective decision making to co-exist with each other.
   Open source software (OSS) communities are a globally accelerating
   phenomenon. OSS refers to groups of programs that allow the free use of
   the software and further the code sharing to the general and corporate
   users of the software. The combination of private provision and public
   knowledge and software, and the seeming paradox of economic versus
   social motivations have stimulated a wide debate between researchers and
   policymakers. In this article, we analyze OSS communities from the
   viewpoint of ``intrinsic motivation,{''} knowledge creation, and
   collective Internet governance. We believe that the growth of global OSS
   has fundamental implications for business ethics and the governance of
   the global Internet in the twenty-first century.},

Title = {Collective Dynamics of Citizenship Behaviour: What Group Characteristics

Journal = {JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT STUDIES},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {46},
Number = {8},
Pages = {1396-1420},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {P>A basic tenet of research on organizational citizenship behaviour
   (OCB) is that OCB aggregated across individuals improves organizational
   performance. Departing from the typical focus on individual-level OCB,
   the construct of group-level OCB (GOCB) recently emerged as a critical
   group function that affects various group effectiveness measures.
   Despite the clear link between GOCB and team performance, the existing
   literature provides a limited understanding with regard to the
   antecedents of GOCB, mostly focusing on leadership variables.
   Establishing helping behaviour (a core dimension of OCB) as a collective
   construct, this study substantially expands the antecedents of
   group-level helping, and empirically tests their effects using three
   different operationalizations of group-level helping. The results, based
   on a sample of 96 work units, show that membership diversity in gender
   and education decreased group-level helping, whereas diversity in tenure
   increased it. Group-level helping was also positively related to
   leadership characteristics (supportive unit manager, transformational
   top management) and perceived competence of unit members. In addition,
   the analysis further indicated that perceived competence is a positive
   predictor of group-level helping only when the unit members also believe
   that others are trustworthy in terms of integrity and benevolent
   motivation. From a methodological standpoint, the study provides
   important insights by comparing different ways of operationalizing
   collective constructs.},

   inconsistencies between the demands and the practices of NGOs and

   specific changes in U.S. state laws. The study's findings indicate that
   local structures correspond to greater legal innovation and elaboration,
   but less variation. Conversely, federated structures correspond to less
   legal innovation and elaboration, and greater content variation. These
   findings both challenge extant theories regarding organizational
   capacities of local and federated organizations and extend contemporary
   conceptions of diffusion.},

Abstract = {In this article, we argue that the ability of a firm to access a variety
   of knowledge resources and, in turn, upgrade its products depends on its
   being tied not simply to any or many organizations and institutions, but
   rather to those that act as social and knowledge bridges between
   previously isolated producer communities. Through a multimethod analysis
   of the recent transformation of the Argentine wine industry, we
   highlight how distinct governance rules for new government support
   institutions can anchor their multiplex, cross-cutting network
   qualities, which underpin their ability to provide improved collective
   resources and reshape the ties between firms.},

Abstract = {Following recent interest in contextual factors and how they might
   influence the effects of transformational leadership, we consider the
   social distance between leaders and followers as a cross-level moderator
   of the relationships between senior level managers' transformational
   leadership and individual-level outcomes. Our sample comprised 268
   individuals in 50 leader-follower groups. Results revealed that high
   social distance reduced or neutralized transformational leadership's
   association with followers' emulation of leader behavior. In contrast,
   high levels of social distance between leaders and followers enhanced
   the effects of transformational leadership on individuals' perceptions
   of their units' positive emotional climate and individuals' sense of
   collective efficacy. Results not only highlight the importance of social
   distance as a contextual variable affecting leader-follower relations
   but also suggest that the same contextual variable may have differential
   effects, enhancing some relationships and neutralizing others.},

Abstract = {We develop and corroborate the latent aspect of institutional theory

   audiences are rare. Nonetheless, this process of institutional
   spectatorship represents an important foundation of various strands of
   institutional theorizing. Also, a better understanding of the ceremonial
   interactions between organizations and their spectators would help the
   field of institutional theory reconnect itself to its phenomenological
   origins. To advance our grasp of institutional spectatorship. we report
   a study of the Canadian beer brewing industry that shows how the
   symbolic self-presentations of breweries are reproduced by a central
   spectator' the news media. The results suggest that institutional
   spectatorship is an important dramaturgical process that influences the

Volume = {57},

Abstract = {Data-mining techniques can be used not only to study collective behavior
   about customers, but also to discover private information about
   individuals. In this study, we demonstrate that decision trees, a
   popular classification technique for data mining, can be used to
   effectively reveal individuals' confidential data, even when the
   identities of the individuals are not present in the data. We propose a
   novel approach for organizations to protect confidential data from such
   a classification attack. The key components of this approach include a
   set of entropy-based measures to evaluate disclosure risks of individual
   records, an optimal pruning algorithm to identify high-risk records, and
   a pair of data-swapping procedures to reduce the disclosure risks. The
   proposed method provides the best trade-off between data utility and
   privacy protection against classification attacks. It can be applied to
   data with both numeric and categorical attributes. An experimental study
   on six real-world data sets shows that the proposed method is very
   effective in protecting privacy while enabling legitimate data mining

Title = {Making Sense Through Face: Identity and Social Interaction in a
   Consultancy Task Force},
Journal = {ORGANIZATION STUDIES},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {30},
Number = {11},
Pages = {1227-1248},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {In this article we investigate the dynamic connection between individual
   and social processes of sensemaking in the context of group-based
   interaction. Drawing on Goffman's theory of face-to-face behaviour, we
   develop two main arguments. First, the grounding of identity underlying
   group-based interaction typically involves repeated face games during
   which participants attempt to influence the patterns of interaction
   while maintaining a coherent image of self. Second, face games generate
   an `interaction order' that has structuring properties and is therefore
   central to the social construction of sense within a group setting. We
   illustrate our contribution through an empirical study of face games and
   sensemaking within a consultancy task force. The study shows that the
   copresence of participants during group based interaction is in itself
   an occasion for sensemaking as it enacts language-based controversies
   that require composition through shared construction of meaning. In
   addition, our findings highlight that early impressions generate sticky
   patterns of interaction that constrain further exchanges and affect the
   development and outcomes of group sensemaking. p main implication is
   that positive outcomes of sensemaking are contingent upon the ability of
   the participants collectively to generate interaction orders that are
   conducive to working consensus. In this regard, sensegiving mechanisms
   such as leadership can constructively orient interaction amongs
   professionals by providing a common set of expectations about
   behaviours.},

Abstract = {This essay attempts to establish an alternative and more accurate way of

   they currently exist are a product of rationalist, positivist thought of
   the nineteenth century, and have in recent decades emerged from their
   increasingly complex conditions of existence into autonomous,
   self-regulating entities that can best be described as
   cyber-corporations or cybercorps. The cybercorp, as an emergent being,
   is capable of acting on the (human) subsystems from which it has
   emerged, determining their behavior. Human individuality, and in
   particular individual ethical sensibility, is sacrificed to the
   organizational culture of the cybercorp in a way that is analogous to
   the life-experience of ants in a colony. The pertinent organizational
   culture and its values are hegemonic and can be effectively challenged
   only if their source in the cybercorp is clearly recognized.},

Title = {The effect of conspicuous consumption on men's testosterone levels},
Journal = {ORGANIZATIONAL BEHAVIOR AND HUMAN DECISION PROCESSES},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {110},
Number = {2},
Pages = {80-92},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Using evolutionary psychology as a theoretical framework, it is argued
   that conspicuous consumption serves as a means by which men communicate
   their social status to prospective mates. Accordingly, men's
   endocrinological responses, particularly their testosterone levels, are
   responsive to fluctuations in their status as triggered by acts of
   conspicuous consumption. Study 1 reports that men's testosterone levels
   increased and decreased partially (directionally), after driving an
   expensive sports car and an old family sedan, respectively.
   Additionally, the location of the drive, either a busy downtown area or
   a semi-deserted highway, partially moderated this response. Study 2
   demonstrates that when men's social status was threatened by the wealth
   displays of a male confederate in the presence of a female moderator,
   their testosterone levels increased. This is suggestive of an evolved
   mechanism for responding to intra-sexual challenges. Collectively, these
   constitute the first set of studies to measure hormonal outcomes in
   consumer behavior. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The study of the biological underpinnings of behavior is in its nascent
   stages in the field of management. We study how the hormone testosterone
   (T) is related to status and collective efficacy in a group. We assessed
   salivary testosterone of 579 individuals in 92 teams. We find that T
   does not predict status within the group. We also tested the effects of
   a mismatch between T and status in the group on the collective efficacy
   of the group. Using a novel slope-as-predictor multilevel structural
   equation model, we find that the greater the mismatch between T and
   status in the group (i.e., the more negative the correlation among T and
   status), the lower is the collective efficacy of the group. We discuss
   the implications of our findings for the study of the biological
   underpinnings of group behavior in organizations. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Abstract = {The present study reports two sets of meta-analyses of employee
   commitment across cultures. First, using three-level hierarchical linear
   modeling, differences in mean levels of commitment were investigated. We
   examined the effects of individualism-collectivism and power distance
   values and practices (Hofstede, GLOBE) while controlling for study and
   industry effects. The findings showed that affective commitment (across
   48 countries), continuance commitment (31 countries) and normative
   commitment (30 countries) were influenced by country-level individualism
   and power distance. Greater collectivism was associated with higher
   normative commitment, and greater power distance was associated with
   higher continuance and normative commitment. Economic variables were
   found to exert a strong influence on affective and normative commitment
   means. Second, relationships between affective commitment and turnover
   intentions (across 26 countries) were found to be somewhat stronger in
   individualistic settings, whereas the normative commitment-turnover
   intentions relationships (across 10 countries) were stronger in
   collectivistic settings. Overall, absolute cross-cultural differences in
   all analyses were relatively small compared with differences due to
   study and industry effects, but country-level predictors accounted for
   substantive proportions of the variance between countries. Implications
   for commitment and cross-cultural research are discussed, and particular
   attention is drawn to the need to explore the meaning of commitment
   across cultural and economic contexts. Journal of International Business

Abstract = {Representative agent models are inconsistent with existing empirical
   evidence for steep demand curves for individual stocks. This paper
   resolves the puzzle by proposing that stock prices are instead set by
   two separate classes of investors. While the market portfolio is still
   priced by individual investors based on their collective risk aversion,
   those individual investors also delegate part of their wealth to active
   money managers, who use that capital to price stocks in the cross
   section. In equilibrium, the fee charged by active managers has to equal
   the before-fee alpha the), earn. This endogenously determines the amount
   of active capital and the slopes of demand curves. A calibration of the
   model reveals that demand curves can be steep enough to match the
   magnitude of many empirical findings, including the price effects for
   stocks entering or leaving the S\&P 500 index.},

Abstract = {Although individual- and team-level studies of motivational processes
   abound, very few have sought to link such phenomena across levels.
   Filling this gap, we build upon Chen and Kanfer's (2006) multilevel
   theoretical model of motivation in teams, to advance and test a
   cross-level model of relationships between individual and team
   motivation and performance. Data from two samples of undergraduates
   performing simulated team tasks supported the direct and mediated
   cross-level relationships between team-level prior performance,
   efficacy, and action processes with individual- level self-efficacy,
   goal striving, and performance. The findings provide support for a
   multilevel, system-based formulation of motivation and performance in
   teams. Findings also contribute to the on-going debate on whether
   motivational processes account for performance once controlling for
   prior performance. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {This study reanalyses the commuter train incident that involved the West
   Japan Railway Company (JR West). The incident, which occurred on 25
   April 2005, claimed 107 lives (passengers and the train driver) and
   injured 562 passengers. The delay in using the brake and the train
   driver's inattention generated confusion and serious errors. The train
   driver's inattentiveness may be attributed to his grave concern over
   reporting personal mistakes to company authorities as it is mandatory
   for erring JR West crew members to go through `learning practices'. The
   phenomenological analyses showed how the unintended consequences of such
   learning practices played a key role in the train incident. This study
   also draws on Foucault's concepts on discipline to analyse the learning
   practices in JR West, and employs the concept of collective myopia to
   account for the reasoning of JR West managers.},

Abstract = {The objectives of this research are first to empirically replicate
   Advanced Manufacturing Technology (AMT) utilization taxonomies
   identified in foregoing research, second to investigate the relationship
   between patterns of AMT utilization and manufacturing capabilities
   attainment, and third to explore differences in context, and performance
   across AMT groups. Theories of performance frontiers and capability
   progression provide the basis for our hypotheses. Data were collected
   from 224 U.S. manufacturing plants in industries considered to have
   potential utilizations of AMTs. A cluster analysis of the data yields a
   solution that closely resembles a previous AMT utilization taxonomy,
   including four groups labeled, respectively, as Traditionalists,
   Generalists, High Investors, and Designers. Significant manufacturing
   capability differences across these four groups indicate that plants
   that utilize a broader scope of AMTs enjoy a greater breadth of
   manufacturing capabilities. The implied capability attainment pattern is
   consistent with cumulative capability theory. However, the results
   suggest that cost capability is not included in the capability mix when
   broad-based AMT utilization is the enabler of capability gains. A post
   hoc exploration of the AMT groups indicates significant differences in
   performance across the groups. Collectively, the results extend prior
   research by providing added insights into the possible rationale and
   impact of AMT utilization patterns.},

Abstract = {A detailed survey of 498 high technology small and medium-sized
   enterprises in the Netherlands shows process innovation by user firms to
   be common practice. Fifty-four percent of these firms reported
   developing entirely novel process equipment or software for their own
   use and/or modifying these, both at significant private expense.
   Twenty-five percent of the user innovations in our sample were
   transferred to commercializing producer firms. Many transfers were made
   without any direct compensation. Very importantly from the perspective
   of effective diffusion of user innovations, innovations with higher
   commercial potential - and more general appeal for users - are much more
   likely to be transferred to producers. The pattern we document of
   frequent innovation by individual user firms at substantial cost,
   followed in many cases by voluntary, no-charge information spillovers to
   producers, suggests that ``open source economics{''} may be a general
   pattern in the economy. (C) 2009 Published by Elsevier B.V.},

Title = {Can Audit Reforms Affect the Information Role of Audits? Evidence from
   the German Market},

Abstract = {We investigate whether audit reforms affect the information role of
   audits in a country where the audit traditionally serves a statutory
   reporting function. Specifically, we investigate the audit market
   effects of audit reforms mandated by the German government in the Act on
   Control and Transparency of Enterprises ({''}the Act{''}). We test for
   differences in the types of audit reports issued, the information
   content of first-time going-concern audit opinions, and the demand for
   dominant audit suppliers before and after the implementation of the Act
   to draw inferences on whether the audit reforms enhanced the information
   role of German audits. We find an increase in the frequency of modified
   audit opinions after the audit objective changed from verifying assets
   in place to identifying and reporting concern uncertainties and
   noncompliant financial reporting practices. We also find an increase in
   the information content of first-time going-concern audit reports issued
   after the audit reforms were implemented. In addition, the results also
   indicate an increase in the demand for dominant audit suppliers in the
   postreform years. Moreover, we document a significant increase in the
   number of auditor lawsuits after the audit reforms went into effect.
   Collectively, our results suggest that audit reforms improved the
   information role of German audits and that German firms responded to the
   improvement in audit reporting by increasing their demand for dominant
   audit suppliers.},

Volume = {26},

Abstract = {We conduct a field survey to investigate whether current mid-level and
   future entry-level managers (collectively ``managers{''}) subjectively
   value stock options and restricted stock consistent with economic
   theory. We find that managers, on average, subjectively value stock
   options at greater than their Black-Scholes value and greater than
   fair-value-equivalent restricted stock. This result contrasts with
   conventional economic wisdom that risk-averse employees discount the
   Black-Scholes value of an option. With respect to stock options, our
   results also reveal that managers, on average, have a lottery ticket
   mentality when subjectively valuing options; they value shorter vesting
   periods, and they value longer terms to maturity. With respect to stock
   options and restricted stock, we find that managers tend to extrapolate
   recently rising stock price trends to arrive at their subjective values.
   Overall, our results suggest that in some cases standard economic theory
   does not accurately reflect how managers appear to subjectively value
   stock options and restricted stock.},

Title = {Are You Having Trouble Keeping Your Operations Focused?},
Journal = {HARVARD BUSINESS REVIEW},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {87},
Number = {9},
Pages = {90+},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {As a business broadens over time, it can lose the operational edge that
   led to its original success. Core strengths atrophy, efficiency or
   quality suffers, and sharper rivals close in to take advantage of the
   loss of focus.
   In his classic article ``The Focused Factory{''} (HBR May-June 1974),
   Wickham Skinner proposed that manufacturers whose product lines had
   proliferated create specialized units, each dedicated to a distinct
   task, To make this economically feasible, he suggested the plant within
   a plant, or PWP, model, whereby an existing facility is physically and
   organizationally divided into autonomous operations.
   Many organizations - from airlines to hospitals to department stores -
   have since adopted the model, in the form of focused units that share
   people, equipment, and other assets to some extent. But they've found it
   difficult to implement. That's because, the author writes, they don't
   give every unit narrowly defined objectives; they underestimate the
   challenges related to sharing resources; they don't fully consider to
   what degree best practices, knowledge, and talent should be shared; and
   they don't anticipate the political tensions that can arise.
   Huckman provides guidelines for setting clear objectives, getting the
   boundaries between units right, establishing rules for sharing, and
   customizing performance criteria. And, he says, leaders must continually
   remind units of their individual and collective goals and purposes
   whenever decisions about resources, performance measurement, and
   compensation are made.},

Abstract = {This article examines whether and to what extent Confucianism as a
   resilient Chinese cultural tradition can be used as a sound basis of
   business practice and management model for Chinese corporations in the
   twenty-first century. Using the core elements of Confucianism, the
   article constructs a notion of a Confucian Firm with its concepts of the
   moral person (Junzi), core human morality (ren, yi, li) and
   relationships (guanxi), as well as benign social structure (harmony),
   articulated in corporate and organizational terms. The basic character
   of the Confucian Firm is described, and its philosophical and cultural
   foundation is critically assessed with respect to its moral legitimacy
   and relevant to today's China. China's recent Corporate Social
   Responsibility (CSR) development is a high profile response to global
   business ethics concerns. Efforts have been made to emulate and develop
   good business practice fashioned in CSR norms and visions. The so-called
   ``human-based{''} and ``virtue-based{''} business practices rooted in
   local cultural heritage have been touted as a Chinese response to this
   problem. This investigation is particularly relevant in the context of
   the increasingly prominence of the Chinese corporations (China Inc.) in
   the wake of the rise of China as a global power. How relevant is
   Confucianism to the building of a modern Chinese corporation that is
   willing and able to practice reasonable norms of business ethics? The
   findings of this discussion, which include the organizational
   implications of the Confucian familial collectivism, have implications
   for other Chinese communities (Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Singapore) where
   Confucian tradition is endorsed and practiced.},

Volume = {37},
Number = {3},
Pages = {328-344},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The meanings of brand and branding have been evolving over the past
   several decades. This evolution is converging on a new conceptual logic,
   which views brand in terms of collaborative, value co-creation
   activities of firms and all of their stakeholders and brand value in
   terms of the stakeholders' collectively perceived value-in-use. The
   authors argue that this new logic parallels and reflects the related,
   evolving service-dominant (S-D) logic in marketing. They provide an
   historical account of the branding literature, organize it into eras,
   and connect it to the evolution in marketing as captured by S-D logic.
   The analysis provides further support for the S-D logic of marketing and
   suggests a related research agenda for furthering the understanding of
   brand and branding. It also suggests that marketing managers might
   benefit from investing resources in building strong brand relationships
   with all of their stakeholders and a service-dominant firm philosophy
   built around brand value co-creation.},

Journal = {MIS QUARTERLY},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {33},
Number = {3},

Abstract = {Agency theory has served as a key basis for identifying drivers of
   offshore information system project success. Consequently, the role of
   relational factors in driving project success has been overlooked in
   this literature. In this paper, we address this gap by integrating the
   social embeddedness perspective and the culture literature to theorize
   how and why relational factors affect the success of offshore IS
   projects that are strategic in nature. We identify organizational and
   interpersonal cultural differences as critical success factors in this
   context. Using data from a longitudinal field study of 155 offshore IS
   projects managed by 22 project leaders, we found evidence of a
   relationship between hypothesized relational factors and two measures of
   offshore IS project success-namely, project cost overruns and client
   satisfaction-over and above the effects of project characteristics and
   agency factors. Specifically, we found that information exchange, joint
   problem solving, and trust reduce project cost overruns and improve
   client satisfaction. We also found a relationship between cultural
   differences at the organizational and team level, and offshore IS
   project success. The model explained 40 percent and 41 percent of the
   variance in project cost overruns and client satisfaction, respectively,
   for projects with a client representative. For projects with no client
   representative, the model explained 35 percent and 3 7 percent of the
   variance in project cost overruns and client satisfaction, respectively.
   Collectively, the results have important theoretical and practical
   implications for how client-vendor relationships should be managed when

Abstract = {Attention to weak cues lies in the eyes of the beholder, but there are
   ways to entice such cues into collective view. To examine the link
   between attention to weak cues and learning from rare events, I use
   longitudinal, qualitative data to develop an attention-based perspective
   on how organizations learn from a crisis, a specific type of rare event.
   Learning from a crisis involves understanding why the crisis occurred
   and developing organizational designs for preventing the crisis from
   reoccurring. My data illustrate how disparity in attention to issues
   across the chain of command and the inability to coherently attend to
   weak signs of danger resulted in an unexpected crisis at Novo Nordisk, a
   world leader in diabetes care. The main contribution of my study is the
   development of the concept of attentional triangulation, which refers to
   the intersection of three interdependent dimensions of organizational
   attention (stability, vividness, and coherence) to identify issues that
   have the potential of having critical consequences for the organization.
   I also elaborate on the structures and processes that organizations can
   enact to facilitate attention triangulation for learning from rare
   events.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF MARKETING},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {73},
Number = {5},
Pages = {30-51},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Using social practice theory, this article reveals the process of
   collective value creation within brand communities. Moving beyond a
   single case study, the authors examine previously published research in
   conjunction with data collected in nine brand communities comprising a
   variety of product categories, and they identify a common set of
   value-creating practices. Practices have an ``anatomy{''} consisting of
   (1) general procedural understandings and rules (explicit, discursive
   knowledge); (2) skills, abilities, and culturally appropriate
   consumption projects (tacit, embedded knowledge or how-to); and (3)
   emotional commitments expressed through actions and representations. The
   authors find that there are 12 common practices across brand
   communities, organized by four thematic aggregates, through which
   consumers realize value beyond that which the firm creates or
   anticipates. They also find that practices have a physiology, interact
   with one another, function like apprenticeships, endow participants with
   cultural capital, produce a repertoire for insider sharing, generate
   consumption opportunities, evince brand community vitality, and create
   value. Theoretical and managerial implications are offered with specific
   suggestions for building and nurturing brand community and enhancing
   collaborative value creation between and among consumers and firms.},

Abstract = {Building consumer trust is important for new or unknown Internet
   businesses seeking to extend their customer reach globally. This study
   explores the question: Should website designers take into account the
   cultural characteristics of prospective customers to increase trust,
   given that different trust-building web strategies have different cost
   implications? In this study, we focused on two theoretically grounded
   practical web strategies of customer endorsement, which evokes unit
   grouping, and portal affiliation, which evokes reputation
   categorization, and compared them across two research sites: Australia
   (individualistic culture) and Hong Kong (collectivistic culture). The
   results of the laboratory experiment we conducted, on the website of an
   online bookstore, revealed that the impact of peer customer endorsements
   on trust perceptions was stronger for subjects in Hong Kong than
   Australia and that portal (Yahoo) affiliation was effective only in the
   Australian site. A follow-up study was conducted as a conceptual
   replication, and provided additional insights on the effects of customer
   endorsement versus firm affiliation on trust-building. Together, these
   findings highlight the need to consider cultural differences when
   identifying the mix of web strategies to employ in Internet store
   websites.},

Abstract = {Despite the popularity of agile methods in software development and
   increasing adoption by organizations there is debate about what agility
   is and how it is achieved. The debate suffers from a lack of
   understanding of agile concepts and how agile software development is
   practiced. This paper develops a framework for the organization of agile
   software development that identifies enablers and inhibitors of agility
   and the emergent capabilities of agile teams. The work is grounded in
   complex adaptive systems (CAS) and draws on three principles of
   coevolving systems: match coevolutionary change rate, maximize
   self-organizing, and synchronize exploitation and exploration. These
   principles are used to study the processes of two software development
   teams, one a team using eXtreme Programming (XP) and the other a team
   using a more traditional, waterfall-based development cycle. From the
   cases a framework for the organization of agile software development is
   developed. Time pacing, self-management with discipline and
   routinization of exploration are among the agile enablers found in the
   cases studies while event pacing, centralized management, and lack of
   resources allocated to exploration are found to be inhibitors to
   agility. Emergent capabilities of agile teams that are identified from
   the research include coevolution of business value, sustainable working
   with rhythm, sharing and team learning, and collective mindfulness.},

Abstract = {Rankings of countries by perceived corruption have emerged over the past
   decade as leading indicators of governance and development. Designed to
   highlight countries that are known to be corrupt, their objective is to
   encourage transparency and good governance. High rankings on corruption,
   it is argued, will serve as a strong incentive for reform. The practice
   of ranking and labeling countries ``corrupt,{''} however, may have a
   perverse effect. Consistent with Social Labeling Theory, we argue that
   perceptual indices can encourage the loss of needed investment and,
   thus, contribute to higher rates of corruption within unfavorably ranked
   countries. In effect, corruption indices may inhibit foreign direct
   investment, the effect of which is to encourage the status quo in terms
   of corruption ranking. Using an experimental study design, we test the
   effects of country corruption rankings on the assessment of country
   investment desirability and find ranking exposure causes shifts in
   country investment desirability for 10 of 12 countries studied. These
   findings suggest that corruption rankings, which are based on
   perceptions of corruption, may cause country isolation and a reduction
   in legitimate means of investment.},

Abstract = {We adopt a multilevel perspective to study the transfer of collective
   and individual knowledge. By making a clear theoretical distinction
   between collective and individual attributes in concepts such as
   knowledge, teaching approach, and absorptive capacity, this study
   extends the knowledge transfer literature and provides fresh insights
   into the ways in which collective and individual knowledge are
   transferred. Based on a survey of the capability transfer activities of
   161 engineering units of multinationals in the Chinese automotive
   industry, we empirically validate the distinction between individual and
   collective teaching activities and absorptive capacity. More
   importantly, we find that the largely underexplored collective-level
   mechanisms, such as collective teaching and collective absorptive
   capacity, are more effective in transferring both collective knowledge
   and individual knowledge in comparison to their individual-based
   counterparts. Our findings also have important implications for
   management of multinationals and international joint ventures,

Abstract = {This article uses sociological role theory to help understand ethical
   challenges faced by Norwegian real estate agents. The article begins
   with an introductory case, and then briefly examines the strengths and
   limitations of using legal definitions and rules for understanding real
   estate agency and real estate agent ethics. It goes on to argue that the
   ethical challenges of real estate agency can be described and understood
   as a system of conflicting roles with associated rights and duties, in
   particular sales agent, intermediary and adviser sub-roles. The
   arguments are developed using exploratory findings from a survey of
   Norwegian real estate agents and from several focus groups. The article
   then suggests the use of various intranet tools as a kind of action
   research aimed at putting ethics on the real estate agents' agenda,
   working to develop a collective conscience and collective self-
   criticism among the agents, and, in doing so, building bridges between
   academic research and the practical working world of the agents.},

Title = {The Contrasting Effects of Culture on Consumer Tolerance: Interpersonal
   Face and Impersonal Fate},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH},

Volume = {36},
Number = {2},
Pages = {292-304},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {This research highlights two cultural tendencies-concern for face and
   belief in fate-that are characteristic of Asian (vs. Western) consumers.
   In three cross-cultural studies on service failures, we show that these
   cultural tendencies have contrasting effects on consumer tolerance, such
   that Asian (vs. Western) consumers are more dissatisfied with social
   failures but less dissatisfied with nonsocial failures. We further
   demonstrate that these contrasting effects of culture are sensitive to
   pertinent contextual factors such as the presence of other consumers or
   a fate-suggestive brand name. Overall, our research evinces the
   multidimensionality of cultural influence and points to the need for a
   sharper focus in conceptualizing cross-cultural consumer behavior.},

Pages = {1267-1279},

Abstract = {Recent research has advanced our understanding of how people use the
   advice of others to update their beliefs. Because groups and teams play
   a significant role in organizations and collectively are wiser than
   their individual members, it is important to understand their influence
   on belief revision as well. I report the results of four studies
   examining intuitions about group wisdom and the informational influence
   of groups. In their overt assessments, experimental participants rated
   larger groups as more accurate than smaller groups and discriminated
   more between them when group size was salient. When provided advice,
   participants relied more on groups than individuals to update their
   beliefs, but were only modestly sensitive to group size. Most were
   suboptimal in the use of that advice, overweighting their initial
   beliefs and underweighting the more valid judgment of the group. Thus
   although acknowledged in principle, the wisdom of crowds is only
   shallowly manifest in observed behavior.},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {It is widely recognized that new product development (NPD) is a highly
   interdependent process, yet efforts to empirically model the
   interdependence and examine its effect on firm performance are scarce.
   Our study addresses this research gap. We model firms' abilities to
   collectively collaborate with suppliers, customers, and internal
   employee teams in NPD as collaborative competence and examine its impact
   on project and market performance. Using responses collected from 189
   NPD managers, we find empirical evidence for collaborative competence
   and its differential impact on project and market performance.
   Specifically, we find that collaborative competence has a direct impact
   on project performance, but its impact on market performance is
   indirect, mediated through project performance. The results have
   significant managerial implications; achieving superior market
   performance from inter- and intra-organizational involvement is
   contingent on achieving superior project performance, and companies that
   fail to achieve desired project performance outcomes will also fail in
   achieving market performance goals. Published by Elsevier B.V.},

Abstract = {The present study reported a meta-analysis of the relationship between

   tripartite model of self concept, we argued that the relationship
   between justice perceptions and outcome variables may be influenced by
   the salience of the personal versus relational/collective dimensions of
   self concept. Specifically, we argued that the salience of the personal
   self concept may lead to larger effect sizes in North America. While we
   also argued that the salience of the relational/collective self concept
   may increase the effect of justice perceptions in East Asia, these
   effects may be potentially eclipsed by the concerns for social harmony
   in this region. Results of our study suggest that in general, the
   effects of justice on outcome variables tend to be greater in North
   America than in East Asia.},

Abstract = {Choices are often identity-based yet the identity-to-choice link is not
   necessarily obvious for reasons articulated by the identity-based
   motivation model (Oyserman, D. (2009). Identity-based motivation:
   Implication for action-readiness, procedural readiness and consumer
   behavior. Journal of Consumer Psychology). Specifically, which
   identities are salient and what identities mean in the moment are highly
   dependent on situational cues. Though they feel stable, identities are
   dynamically shaped by situational affordances and constraints and this
   shaping process can occur without conscious awareness. This implies that
   product use, including use of utilitarian products, can become
   identity-based, as can both self-constructive and self-destructive
   choices. Over time, broader identities are more likely to be cued than
   more narrow ones, though any identity can be cued in the right
   circumstances. The commentaries apply the model to culture-contingent
   effects of power (Shavitt, S., Torelli, C. \& Wong, J. (2009).

Month = {JUL-AUG},
Abstract = {For decades, U.S. companies have been outsourcing manufacturing in the
   belief that it held no competitive advantage. That's been a disaster,
   maintain Harvard professors Pisano and Shih, because today's low-value
   manufacturing operations hold the seeds of tomorrow's innovative new
   products.
   What those companies have been ceding is the country's industrial
   commons-that is, the collective operational capabilities that underpin
   new product and process development in the U.S. industrial sector. As a
   result, America has lost not only the ability to develop and manufacture
   high-tech products like televisions, memory chips, and laptops but also
   the expertise to produce emerging hot products like the Kindle e-reader,
   high-end servers, solar panels, and the batteries that will power the
   next generation of automobiles.
   To rebuild the commons and restore its wealth-generating machine will
   require government and industry in the United States to make two drastic
   changes:
   The government must change the way it supports basic and applied
   scientific research to promote the broad collaboration with business and
   academia needed to tackle society's big problems.
   Corporate management practices and governance structures must be
   overhauled so they no longer exaggerate the payoffs and discount the
   dangers of outsourcing production and cutting investments in R\&D.
   Restoring the ability of enterprises to develop and manufacture
   high-tech products in America is the only way the country can hope to
   pay down its enormous deficits and raise its citizens' standard of
   living. Reprint R0907S},

Title = {From new deal institutions to capital markets: Commercial consumer risk
   scores and the making of subprime mortgage finance},
Journal = {ACCOUNTING ORGANIZATIONS AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {34},
Number = {5},
Pages = {654-674},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {The investment fueled US mortgage market has traditionally been
   sustained by New Deal institutions called government sponsored
   enterprises (GSEs). Known as Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, the GSEs once
   dominated mortgage backed securities underwriting. The recent subprime
   mortgage crisis has drawn attention to the fact that during the real
   estate boom, these agencies were temporarily overtaken by risk tolerant
   channels of lending, securitization, and investment, driven by
   investment banks and private capital players. This research traces the
   movement of a specific brand of commercial consumer credit analytics
   into mortgage underwriting. It demonstrates that what might look like
   the spontaneous rise (and fall) of a `free' market divested of direct
   government intervention has been thoroughly embedded in the concerted
   movement of calculative risk management technologies. The
   transformations began with a sequence of GSE decisions taken in the
   mid-1990's to implement a consumer risk score called a FICO (R) into
   automated underwriting systems. Having been endorsed by the GSEs, this
   scoring tool was gradually hardwired throughout the industry to become a
   distributed and collective `market device'. As the paper will show, once
   modified by specific GSE interpretations the calculative properties
   generated by these credit bureau scores reconfigured mortgage finance
   into two parts: the conventional, risk-adverse, GSE conforming `prime'
   and an infrastructurally distinct, risk-avaricious, investment grade
   `subprime'. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Assessing the External Validity of Analytical Results from National
   Brand and Store Brand Competition Models},
Journal = {MARKETING SCIENCE},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {28},
Number = {4},
Pages = {759-781},
Month = {JUL-AUG},
Abstract = {This research has three objectives: (i) to compile analytical results on
   national brand and store brand marketing obtained from mathematical
   models, (ii) to assess the external validity of those results and thus
   the applicability of the results to practice, and (iii) to identify
   avenues for further research on national brand and store brand
   competition.
   A total of 44 analytical results (29 related to retailer strategies and
   15 related to manufacturer strategies) are compiled from a survey of
   literature published between 1966 and 2006. Three criteria are then used
   to assess the external validity of these results-robustness (R),
   empirical support (E), and credibility (C) (collectively, REC). Each
   result is quantitatively assessed (scored) using these three criteria.
   Robustness is measured as the total number of relevant market conditions
   for which the result has been shown to hold. Empirical support is
   measured as the number of independent empirical studies in which the
   findings are consistent with the analytical result. Credibility is
   measured as the believability of the theoretical result as perceived by
   experienced brand managers and retail executives.
   Thus, the REC scoring approach represents a triangulation of
   perspectives-robustness (modeler perspective), empirical support
   (empiricist perspective), and credibility (managerial perspective). In
   particular, this research serves in part as a bridge between scholars
   and practitioners in the context of national brand and store brand
   marketing.},

Title = {Channel Strategies for Durable Goods: Coexistence of Selling and Leasing
   to Individual and Corporate Consumers},

Abstract = {In durable goods markets, such as those for automobiles or computers,
   the coexistence of selling and leasing is common as is the existence of
   both corporate and individual consumers. Leases to corporate consumers
   affect the price of used goods on the second-hand market which in turn
   affect the buying and leasing behavior of individual consumers. The
   setting of prices (or volumes) for sale and lease to individual and
   corporate consumers is a complicated problem for manufacturers. We
   consider a manufacturer who concurrently sells and leases a finitely
   durable good to both individual and corporate consumers. The interaction
   between the manufacturer and consumers is modeled as a dynamic
   sequential game, where each player seeks to maximize its own payoff over
   an infinite horizon. We study how the corporate channel substitutability
   of new goods and used goods and transaction costs in the second-hand
   market affect the manufacturer's pricing decisions, consumer behavior,
   and social welfare in the retail market. Making a number of simplifying
   assumptions, including two-period lifetime for the finitely durable
   goods, we consider Markov Perfect Equilibrium as the solution concept.
   We show that the manufacturer can maximize her profit by segmenting
   consumers according to their willingness to pay. Selling and leasing are
   the mechanisms used for price discrimination in the retail market. We
   show that as she leases a larger share of her production to the
   corporate consumer, (1) the manufacturer does not necessarily have to
   adjust the optimal selling price of new goods to individual consumers,
   and the volume of sales of new goods to individual consumers can stay
   the same; (2) the manufacturer does increase the retail lease price, and
   the number of individual leases decreases; (3) the net supply of used
   goods on the market increases, leading to a lower market price for used
   goods; and (4) more individual consumers are able to participate in the
   market, and their collective welfare or net utility improves. We also
   show that as production costs increase the manufacturer increases
   prices, reducing volumes across all channels. When transaction costs
   increase, the manufacturer reduces leasing in both corporate and retail
   channels.},

Abstract = {Although marketers often link brands with an aspect of consumer social

   linkages may sometimes have negative consequences. Consumers motivated
   to protect and maintain feelings of individual self-worth alter their
   product evaluations and choices to avoid a threatened aspect of their
   own social identity. Whereas those low in collective self-esteem (CSE)
   tend to exhibit such identity avoidance effects, those high in CSE
   maintain associations with an identity-linked brand even when that
   social identity is threatened. Moreover, when the consumer feels
   positively about the self via self-affirmation, the effect among low CSE
   consumers is mitigated. Finally, it is demonstrated that differences in
   the use of identity as a resource underlie the effects. (C) 2009 Society

   generated by the evaluation of the Mexican PROGRESA program with
   variation attributable to localized rainfall shocks as distribution

   optimality. More specifically, female-specific income changes have
   positive effects on children's goods expenditures, whereas changes due
   to rainfall shocks have a smaller influence on household public goods
   expenditures. The evidence is consistent with female partners having
   greater sensitivity to own-income changes and norms that oblige women to

Title = {Institutional differences and the development of entrepreneurial
   ventures: A comparison of the venture capital industries in Latin

Journal = {JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS STUDIES},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {40},
Number = {5},

Month = {JUN-JUL},
Abstract = {This paper examines how differences in distinct institutional clusters
   of countries impact on the vital entrepreneurial activity of venture
   capital, and how individuals, organizations, and their collective action
   in turn shape those institutions. The focus on venture capital offers
   researchers the opportunity to view an industry that comes from a common
   root, with strong and consistent traditions, in which to examine how the
   differing institutional settings impact on behaviors in different
   markets, and how the institutions themselves may change in these
   settings. We also focus on emerging economies, since such economies
   offer a natural laboratory to study the impact of institutional change.
   Specifically, this paper employs an institutional theory perspective to
   examine venture capital in two regions of the world that form
   institutional clusters of countries - Latin America and Asia. It is
   found that the venture capital industry exhibits a strong consistency
   across many dimensions; yet institutions in these two distinct settings
   result in significant differences in industry practice. Therefore this
   research is able to contribute to both empirical and theoretical
   understanding of emerging economies, institutions in those environments,
   and venture capital. Journal of International Business Studies (2009)

Abstract = {In twentieth century Europe and the USA, industrial relations, labour,
   and workers' rights issues have been handled through collective
   bargaining and industrial agreements between firms and unions, with
   varying degrees of government intervention from country to country. This
   industrial relations landscape is currently undergoing fundamental
   change with the emergence of transnational industrial relations systems
   that complement existing national industrial relations systems. Despite
   the significance of this ongoing change, existing research has only
   started to explore the implications of this change for how workers'
   rights are governed around the globe. This paper addresses this gap by
   outlining an agenda for future research into the transnational
   governance of workers' rights. Fulfilling such a research agenda would
   be both challenging, as it requires combining the so far divergent
   industrial relations and business ethics research streams, and
   rewarding, as it provides ample scope for promising future research.},

   We first summarize extant literature by highlighting both the

   entrepreneurial beliefs and strategies. Thereafter we carefully
   explicate the role that entrepreneurial theorizing plays in the
   emergence of novel beliefs about new opportunities and make links with
   experiential and perceptual arguments. We specifically discuss three key
   mechanisms of entrepreneurial theorizing, namely: (1) the triggering
   role of experiential and observational fragments: (2) the imagination of
   possibilities; and (3) reasoning and justification. Importantly, we also
   explicate the social mechanisms of entrepreneurial theorizing and the
   emergence of entrepreneurial beliefs and novel strategies, specifically
   by discussing the role of social interaction and self-selection in

Abstract = {We provide evidence that firms in more unionized industries
   strategically hold less cash to gain bargaining advantages over labor
   unions and shelter corporate income from their demands. Specifically, we
   show that corporate cash holdings are negatively related with
   unionization. We also find that this relation is stronger for firms that
   are likely to place a higher value on gaining a bargaining advantage
   over unions and weaker for those firms in which lower cash holdings
   provide less credible evidence that a firm is unable to concede to union
   demands. Additionally, we show that for unionized firms increases in
   cash holdings raise the probability of a strike. Finally, we show that
   unionization decreases the market value of a dollar of cash holdings.
   Overall, our findings indicate that firms trade-off the benefits of
   corporate cash holdings with the costs resulting from a weaker
   bargaining position with labor. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {Like many constructs within the managerial sciences, organizational
   justice has traditionally been conceptualized as an individual-level
   phenomenon. In recent years, this has begun to change, as a number of
   research studies have explored justice as a collective or group-level
   construct. The authors provide a review of this literature, historically
   tracing the growth of this research tradition, reviewing measurement
   issues, and discussing available research findings. The authors argue
   that there are at least two viable treatments of unit-level justice.
   Justice climate pertains to the manner in which a team is treated by
   outside agents, such as an authority figure. Intraunit justice climate
   pertains to the manner in which teammates treat one another. Although
   much more research is needed, evidence suggests that both justice
   climate and intraunit fairness are useful predictors of work attitudes
   and behavior.},

Abstract = {Consider a group consisting of S members facing a common budget
   constraint p'xi=1: any demand vector belonging to the budget set can be
   (privately or publicly) consumed by the members. Although the intragroup
   decision process is not known, it is assumed to generate
   Pareto-efficient outcomes; neither individual consumptions nor
   intragroup transfers are observable. The paper analyzes when, to what
   extent, and under which conditions it is possible to recover the
   underlying structure-individual preferences and the decision
   process-from the group's aggregate behavior. We show that the general
   version of the model is not identified. However, a simple exclusion
   assumption (whereby each member does not consume at least one good) is
   sufficient to guarantee generic identifiability of the welfare-relevant
   structural concepts.},

Abstract = {Organizational scholars have recently argued that economic theories and
   assumptions have adversely shaped management practice and human
   behavior, not only leading to the incorporation of trust-eroding market
   mechanisms into organizations, but also unnecessarily creating
   self-interested behavior. A number of highly influential papers have
   argued that the self-fulfilling nature of (even false) theories provides
   the underlying mechanism through which economics has adversely shaped
   not just social science but also management practice and individual
   behavior. We question these arguments and argue that there are important
   boundary conditions to theories falsely fulfilling themselves, boundary
   conditions that have hitherto been unexplored in organizational
   research, and boundary conditions that question the underlying premises
   used by organizational scholars and social scientists to attack
   economics. We specifically build on highly relevant findings from social
   psychology, philosophy, and organizational economics to show how (1)
   objective reality and (2) human nature provide two important boundary
   conditions for theories (falsely or otherwise) fulfilling themselves. We
   also defend organizational economics, specifically the use of
   high-powered incentives in organizations, and argue that self-interest
   (rightly understood) facilitates in creating beneficial individual and
   collective and societal outcomes.},

   these articles, individually and collectively, provide an overview of a
   number of epistemic, normative and practical challenges that confront
   us, articulating the main features of each of these. We end with a call
   for a sustained, critical and extensive `conversation' among researchers

Abstract = {Research on organizational climate has tended to focus on independent
   dimensions of climate rather than Studying the total social context as
   configurations of multiple climate dimensions. The authors examined
   relationships between configurations of unit-level climate dimensions
   and organizational outcomes. Three profile characteristics represented
   climate configurations: (1) elevation. or the mean score across climate
   dimensions (2) variability, or the extent to which scores across
   dimensions vary and (3) shape. or the pattern of the dimensions. Across
   2 Studies (1,120 employees in 120 bank branches and 4,317 employees in
   86 food distribution stores). results indicated that elevation was
   related to collective employee attitudes and service perceptions. while
   shape was related to customer satisfaction and financial performance.
   With respect to profile variability. results were mixed. The discussion
   focuses on future directions for taking a configural approach to
   organizational climate.},

Abstract = {This paper provides an exhaustive characterization of testability and
   identifiability issues in the collective framework in the absence of
   price variation; it thus provides a theoretical underpinning for a
   number of empirical works that have been developed recently. We first
   provide a simple and general test of the Pareto-efficiency hypothesis,
   which is consistent with all possible assumptions on the private or
   public nature of goods, all possible consumption externalities between
   household members, and all types of interdependent individual
   preferences and domestic production technology. The test is proved to be
   necessary and sufficient. We then provide conditions for the
   identification of the sharing rule and the Engel curves of individual
   household members for a variety of different observational schemes.},

Abstract = {The creation of carbon markets is one of the solutions currently
   envisaged to meet the widely recognized challenge of global warming. The
   contributions in this special section of Accounting, Organizations and
   Society show that many controversies nevertheless exist on the ways in
   which these markets are organized, the calculative tools that are
   devised to equip them, and the role that they are supposed to play,
   especially in relation to other types of intervention which favour
   political measures or technological research. In light of these
   controversies, the article considers carbon markets as ongoing
   collective experiments. It is argued that carbon trading is in
   exceptional site for identifying the stakes involved in such experiments
   and for identifying better what the dynamics of civilizing markets could
   be. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

   within their professional networks. Consistent with hypotheses about
   Chinese familial collectivism, an egocentric network survey found that
   affect- and cognition-based trust were more intertwined for Chinese than
   for American managers. In addition, the effect of economic exchange on
   affect- based trust was more positive for Chinese than for Americans,
   whereas the effect of friendship was more positive for Americans than
   for Chinese. Finally, the extent to which a given relationship was
   highly embedded in ties to third parties increased cognition-based trust
   for Chinese but not for Americans. Implications for cultural research
   and international business practices are discussed.},

Abstract = {In the present text, an institution is understood to be an ( observable)
   pattern of collective action, justified by a corresponding norm. By this
   definition, an institution emerges slowly, although it may be helped or
   hindered by various specific acts. From this perspective, an
   institutional entrepreneur is an oxymoron, at least in principle. In
   practice, however, there are and always have been people trying to
   create institutions. This article describes the emergence of the London
   School of Economics and Political Science as an institution and analyzes
   its founders and its supporters during crises as institutional
   entrepreneurs. A tentative theory of the phenomenon of institutional
   entrepreneurship is then constructed by combining elements of sociology
   of translation, actor-network theory and garbage can model. The article
   concludes with a suggestion that the way institutional enterprises are
   narrated may differ from the way they are built, and a genre analysis
   can be of further help in understanding this phenomenon.},

   month more in expected sentence for future crimes reduces the

   Questionnaire surveys were collected from 364 employees in 10 banks in

Abstract = {Two field studies tested and extended the group engagement model (Tyler
   \& Blader. 2000, 2003) by examining the model with regard to employee
   extrarole behavior. Consistent with the group engagement model's
   predictions, results of these studies indicate that the social
   identities employees form around their work groups and their
   organizations are strongly related to whether employees engage in
   extrarole behaviors. Moreover, the studies demonstrated that social
   identity explains the impact of other factors that have previously been
   linked to extrarole behavior. In particular, the findings indicate that
   social identity mediates the effect of procedural justice judgments and
   economic outcomes on supervisor ratings of extrarole behavior. Overall,
   these studies provide compelling indication that social identity is an
   important determinant of behavior within work organizations and provide
   strong support for the application of the group engagement model in

Abstract = {Online open source software platforms, such as Sourceforge.net, play a
   vital role in creating an ecosystem that enables the creation and growth
   of open source projects. However, there is little research exploring the
   interactions between open source stakeholders and the platform. We
   believe that the sustainability of the platform crucially depends on
   financial incentives. While platforms can obtain these incentives
   through multiple means, in this paper we focus on one form of financial
   incentives-voluntary monetary donations by open source community
   members. We report findings from two empirical studies that examine
   factors that impact donations. Study I investigates the factors that
   cause some community members to donate and not others. We find that the
   decision to donate is impacted by relational commitment with open source
   software platform, donation to projects and accepting donations from
   others. Study 2 examines what drives the level of donation. We find that
   the length of association with the platform and relational commitment
   affects donation levels. Published by Elsevier B.V.},

Abstract = {While Peace through Commerce (PTC) started as a conversation among a
   small group of scholars it has grown into an increasingly robust
   movement, giving rise to conferences, books, journal articles, and
   dialogue between scholars, managers, practitioners, government
   officials, and civil society actors, all of whom share an interest in
   the potential of commerce to foster greater peace. Because social
   movement scholarship explores the ability of collective interests to
   achieve social change it provides a useful lens through which to
   consider PTC's maturation and, more broadly, the rise of scholarly
   conversations into social movements its. Increasingly, social movement
   theory has been used to describe and better understand a diverse range
   of social and organizational changes (Strang and Il Jung, 2005)
   including academic endeavors (Hambrick and Chen, 2008). I draw on social
   movement theory to characterize the rise of PTC and to consider its
   future growth. I also suggest broader implications for the transition of
   academic dialogue as it attains movement status.},

Abstract = {Information sharing is a central process through which team members
   collectively utilize their available informational resources. The
   authors used meta-analysis to synthesize extant research on team
   information sharing. Meta-analytic results from 72 independent studies
   (total groups = 4,795; total N = 17,279) demonstrate the importance of
   information sharing to team performance, cohesion, decision
   satisfaction, and knowledge integration. Although moderators were
   identified, information sharing positively predicted team performance
   across all levels of moderators. The information sharing-team
   performance relationship was moderated by the representation of
   information sharing (as uniqueness or openness), performance criteria,
   task type, and discussion structure by uniqueness (a 3-way interaction).
   Three factors affecting team information processing were found to
   enhance team information sharing: task demonstrability. discussion
   structure, and cooperation. Three factors representing decreasing
   degrees of member redundancy were found to detract from team information
   sharing: information distribution, informational interdependence, and
   member heterogeneity.},

Volume = {20},

Abstract = {In contrast to the prevailing interpretation of capabilities as
   collectives, this inductive study of product development in a leading
   design firm highlights the centrality of the myriad ordinary activities
   that may shape the evolution of capabilities. A detailed comparison of
   90 diverse product development processes over a 15-year period shows,
   first, that mindful microactivities carried out by individuals in and
   around the organization and at all levels of the organizational
   hierarchy are central in shaping the content of the product development
   capability and its dynamic adaptation. Understanding organizational
   renewal and competitive advantage may hence require a partial shift in
   focus from capabilities as aggregate entities, to the practical
   realities of core organizational processes. Second, this more
   fine-grained perspective leads to a set of insights on how
   organizational renewal may be partially shaped by timely managerial
   interventions aimed at encoding successful experiments into higher-level
   organizational capabilities. Third, higher-level capabilities resulting
   from the conversion of heterogeneous experiences display higher process
   homogeneity and a permanent increase in performance, because of
   stabilization of managerial attention. My findings contribute to
   unveiling the concept of capabilities, extending prior research on
   dynamic capabilities and organizational renewal and providing a lens for
   research on the microfoundations of capability evolution and
   organizational advantage.},

   to evaluate the different single decisions that were made and
   implemented to make the company meet high ethical standards, but rather
   to focus on three issues and on how they relate to each other: (1) the
   shift from a communitarian Christian set of values to a broader secular
   framework of basic principles; (2) the way in which business people in a
   retailing company cope with issues that seem ethically troublesome, when
   reflected upon from a ethical point of view; and (3) how the process of
   ethical dialogue has led to a typology of the different levels of
   responsibility that retailers are willing to attribute to themselves
   according to the kind of problem at stake. The three issues together
   illustrate how a company that took the business ethics question head-on
   systematically moved into a particular ongoing collective learning

Journal = {MANAGEMENT SCIENCE},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {55},
Number = {2},
Pages = {224-239},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission enacted Rule 10b5-1 to deter
   insiders from trading with private information, yet also protect
   insiders' preplanned, non-information-based trades from litigation.
   Despite its requirement that insiders plan trades when not privately
   informed, the rule appears to enable strategic trade. Participating
   insiders' sales systematically follow positive and precede negative firm
   performance, generating abnormal forward-looking returns larger than
   those earned by nonparticipating colleagues. The observed association
   does not appear to be explained by market transaction disclosure
   response, ``predictable{''} reversion following positive performance, or
   general periodic price declines. There is evidence, however, that a
   substantive proportion of randomly drawn plan initiations are associated
   with pending adverse news disclosures. There is also evidence that early
   sales plan terminations are associated with pending positive performance
   shifts, reducing the likelihood that insiders' sales execute at low
   prices. Collectively, this suggests that, on average, trading within the
   rule does not solely reflect uninformed diversification.},

Abstract = {Three studies investigated the impact of self-construal on impulsive

   beer consumption (study 1a) and state-level problem alcohol consumption
   (study 1b). Experimentally primed independents reported more positive
   attitudes toward immediate beer consumption than did interdependents,
   and this effect was mediated by state impulsivity. Peer presence
   increased impulsive consumption tendencies for independents but
   decreased them for interdependents (studies 2 and 3). The moderating
   effect of self-construal was linked to greater motivation to suppress
   impulsive tendencies for interdependents than for independents (study

Title = {A Theory of Combative Advertising},
Journal = {MARKETING SCIENCE},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {28},
Number = {1},
Pages = {1-19},
Month = {JAN-FEB},
Abstract = {In mature markets with competing firms, a common role for advertising is
   to shift consumer preferences towards the advertiser in a tug-of-war,
   with no effect on category demand. In this paper, we analyze the effect
   of such ``combative{''} advertising on market power. We show that,
   depending on the nature of consumer response, combative advertising can
   reduce price competition to benefit competing firms. However, it can
   also lead to a procompetitive outcome where individual firms advertise
   to increase their own profitability, but collectively become worse off.
   This is because combative advertising can intensify price competition
   such that an ``advertising war{''} leads to a ``price war.{''} Similar
   to price competition, advertising competition can result in a prisoner's
   dilemma where all competing firms make less profit even when the effect
   of each firm's advertising is to enhance consumer preferences in its
   favor. Given such procompetitive effects, we further show that cost of
   combative advertising could be a blessing in disguise-higher unit cost
   of advertising resulting in lower equilibrium levels of advertising,
   leading to higher prices and profits. We conduct a laboratory experiment
   to investigate how combative advertising by competing brands influences
   consumer preferences. Our experimental analysis offers strong support
   for our conclusions.},

Abstract = {The present study integrates institutional factors and employee-based
   collective processes as predictors of 2 key implementation outcomes:
   implementation effectiveness and innovation effectiveness (Klein, Conn.

   factors shape employees' collective implementation efficacy and
   innovation acceptance. The authors further hypothesized that these
   employee-based collective processes mediate the effects of institutional
   factors on implementation outcomes. This integrative framework was
   examined in the context of 47 agencies and ministries of the Korean
   Government that were implementing a process innovation called
   E-Government. Three-wave longitudinal data were collected from 60
   external experts and 1,732 government employees. The results reveal the
   importance of management support for collective implementation efficacy,
   which affected employees' collective acceptance of the innovation. As
   hypothesized, these collective employee dynamics mediated the effects of
   institutional enablers on successful implementation as well as the
   amount of long-term benefit that accrued to the agencies and ministries.},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to contribute to research on organizational
   identity by developing a psychoanalytic perspective. In particular, the
   author draws on Lacanian theorizing to explore how organizational
   identity discourse is informed by imaginary constructions of
   subjectivity. It is proposed that the collective construction of
   coherent, unitary, and definably organizational identity discourse is
   validated by and validates conscious but illusory constructions of the
   self. The resulting discourse is inevitably disrupted by unconscious
   subjectivity and invariably fails. Therefore, the collective
   construction of fragmented, dynamic, and emergent organizational
   identity discourse is equally inevitable. While such discourse can be
   illusory, it also contains the opportunity for engaging in liberating
   struggles with identity as lack. The implications of this perspective
   for the theory and practice of organizational identity are discussed.},

Abstract = {Previous distance-related theories and concepts (e.g., social distance)
   have failed to address the sometimes wide disparity in perceptions
   between leaders and the teams they lead. Drawing from the extensive
   literature on teams, leadership, and cognitive models of social
   information processing, the authors develop the concept of leader-team
   perceptual distance, defined as differences between a leader and a team
   in perceptions of the same social stimulus. The authors investigate the
   effects of perceptual distance on team performance, operationalizing the
   construct with 3 distinct foci: goal accomplishment, constructive
   conflict, and decision-making autonomy. Analyzing leader, member, and
   customer survey responses for a large sample of teams, the authors
   demonstrate that perceptual distance between a leader and a team
   regarding goal accomplishment and constructive conflict have a nonlinear
   relationship with team performance. Greater perceptual differences are
   associated with decreases in team performance. Moreover, this effect is
   strongest when a team's perceptions are more positive than the leader's
   are (as opposed to the reverse). This pattern illustrates the pervasive
   effects that perceptions can have on team performance, highlighting the
   importance of developing awareness of perceptions in order to increase
   effectiveness. Implications for theory and practice are delineated.},

Title = {The Burden of Knowledge and the ``Death of the Renaissance Man{''}: Is
   Innovation Getting Harder?},
Journal = {REVIEW OF ECONOMIC STUDIES},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {76},
Number = {1},
Pages = {283-317},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {This paper investigates a possibly fundamental aspect of technological
   progress. If knowledge accumulates as technology advances, then
   successive generations of innovators may face an increasing educational
   burden. Innovators can compensate through lengthening educational phases
   and narrowing expertise, but these responses come at the cost of
   reducing individual innovative capacities, with implications for the
   organization of innovative activity-a greater reliance on teamwork-and
   negative implications for growth. Building on this ``burden of
   knowledge{''} mechanism, this paper first presents six facts about
   innovator behaviour. I show that age at first invention, specialization,
   and teamwork increase over time in a large micro-data set of inventors.
   Furthermore, in cross-section, specialization and teamwork appear
   greater in deeper areas of knowledge, while, surprisingly, age at first
   invention shows little variation across fields. A model then
   demonstrates how these facts can emerge in tandem. The theory further
   develops explicit implications for economic growth, providing an
   explanation for why productivity growth rates did not accelerate through
   the 20th century despite an enormous expansion in collective research
   effort. Upward trends in academic collaboration and lengthening
   doctorates, which have been noted in other research, can also be
   explained in this framework. The knowledge burden mechanism suggests
   that the nature of innovation is changing, with negative implications
   for long-run economic growth.},

   nationality and educational diversity were positively related to team
   leaders' longitudinal ratings of team performance. These relationships
   were nonsignificant when transformational leadership was low. Age
   diversity was not related to team performance when transformational
   leadership was high, and it was negatively related to team performance
   when transformational leadership was low. Two mediated moderation
   effects help explain these findings. Transformational leadership
   moderated the relationship of the 3 examined diversity dimensions with

   positively associated with team performance. Moreover, transformational
   leadership moderated the relationship of the 3 diversity types with

Volume = {108},
Number = {1},
Pages = {153-163},

Abstract = {This study adopted a contextual framework to examine whether an
   interaction between group culture and economic power influences
   self-interest in a simulated commons dilemma. Full-time managers
   enrolled in executive MBA programs in Germany, Hong Kong, Israel, and
   the United States (US) made decisions in an asymmetric commons dilemma.
   Relative to managers from the US and Germany, Israeli managers were more
   likely to follow an individually rational decision-making approach,
   taking more resources in a high versus low economic power condition. In
   contrast, managers from Hong Kong in a high economic power condition
   followed a collectively rational approach, voluntarily taking fewer
   resources. Egocentrism mediated this interaction effect of group culture
   and economic power for the Israeli managers who were more egocentric and
   believed it was fair to harvest more resources in a high power
   condition. However, egocentrism did not mediate the interaction effect
   for managers from Hong Kong. The theoretical and practical implications
   of the findings highlight the importance of studying the proximal effect
   of group culture on contextual factors, such as economic power
   asymmetry, that influence cooperation in social dilemmas. (C) 2008

Abstract = {Prior research has found that people tend to overestimate their relative

   investigates one source of this bias, and in doing so, identifies an

   people estimate their relative contribution to collective endeavors they
   focus on their own contribution and give less consideration to the
   contribution of their collaborators. This can cause overestimation for
   tasks in which total contributions are plentiful, but underestimation
   for tasks in which total contributions are few-despite the fact that
   both tasks reflect positively on the person who performs them. These
   results extend Ross and Sicoly's (1979) original analysis of bias in

   overestimate one's relative contribution to collaborations is not as

Journal = {JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ETHICS},

Volume = {86},
Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {97-108},
Abstract = {This article critically evaluates current developments in marketing fair
   trade labelled products and ``no sweat{''} manufactured goods, and
   argues that both the fair trade and ethical trade movements increasingly
   rely on strategies for bottom-up change, converting consumers ``one cup
   at a time{''}. This individualistic approach, which we call ``shopping
   for a better world{''}, must, we argue, be augmented by more
   collectivist approaches to affect transformative change. Specifically,
   we look at the concept of mission-driven organizations pursuing
   leadership roles in developing affinity relationships to promote fair
   and ethical trade and developing ethical spaces. Increasingly, a range
   of organizations are restructuring their operations, so that their
   mission is reflected in ethical practices throughout their operations,
   including product sourcing and product sales. First, ethical purchasing
   policies operated by non-profits and public agencies represent markets
   through which fair/ ethical products reach end consumers. The efforts
   discussed to create ethical spaces through direct democracy and
   electoral mandate build on a broad-based affinity with the principles of
   fair and ethical trade. Second, we explore the potential for
   ``mission-driven{''} non-profit organizations, such as zoos and aquaria
   for merging their mission of conservation education with their marketing
   activities through the operation of their shops and cafes. Interesting
   initiatives to link the conservation message to food choices is being
   undertaken by a number of zoos and aquaria, while there is scope for
   increased linkages in the giftware sold in their shops.},

Abstract = {This paper introduces emotional aperture, defined as the ability to
   recognize the composition of diverse emotions in a collective (e. g.,
   group or business unit). We develop the thesis that a leader's ability
   to respond effectively to patterns of shared emotions that arise during
   strategic change and other emotionally turbulent organizational
   processes depends on the leader's ability to use emotional aperture.
   Additionally, we describe key cultural, psychological, and contextual
   enablers and impediments to achieving the necessary focus and accuracy
   that characterize the effective use of emotional aperture in
   organizations. This paper provides an initial conceptualization of how
   individuals can adjust their attention to group-level emotions and thus
   extends existing notions of emotional competencies (e.g., emotional
   intelligence) that have focused more narrowly on individual-level

Abstract = {Using the context of market orientation, we examine how an exemplary
   business's market orientation culture is reflected in managers' mental
   models, evaluate how mental models and perceived behaviours differ
   across hierarchical levels and functions, and compare the cognitive
   values and beliefs or the cognitive aspects of market orientation
   culture with behavioural aspects. Results from a rich, multi-method,
   case study suggest that while managers in the business share core
   beliefs regarding the customer dimension of market orientation, their
   beliefs regarding competitors, technology and inter-functional
   coordination dimensions vary widely across the levels and functions of
   the business. We found differences in terms of both the integration
   between the four dimensions of market orientation and the depth of
   knowledge within the dimensions. Our findings reveal that customer
   rather than competitor beliefs are the most important commonly shared
   beliefs in successful companies, leading us to encourage cognitive
   researchers to move beyond competitor analysis when examining managerial
   cognition. Another implication for future research is that a strong
   market orientation implies common core beliefs regarding customer
   dimensions but does not imply that all beliefs will be or should be
   shared. From the methodological standpoint, we find that cognitive
   mapping techniques provide rich insights into a business's market
   orientation culture that are not gained from behavioural methods alone.},

Title = {THE Quick Wins Paradox},
Journal = {HARVARD BUSINESS REVIEW},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {87},
Number = {1},
Pages = {54+},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Many leaders taking on new roles try to prove themselves early on by
   going after quick wins - fresh, visible contributions to the business.
   But in the pursuit of early results, those leaders often fall into traps
   that prevent them from benefiting from their achievements. To succeed in
   their new positions, leaders must realize that the teams they have
   inherited are also experiencing change. Instead of focusing on an
   individual accomplishment, leaders need to work with team members on a
   collective quick win.
   In a study of more than 5,400 new leaders, the authors found that those
   who were struggling tended to exhibit five behaviors characteristic of
   people overly intent on securing a quick win. They focused too much on
   details, reacted negatively to criticism, intimidated others, jumped to
   conclusions, and micromanaged their direct reports. Some managed to eke
   out a win anyway, but the fallout was often toxic.
   The leaders who were thriving in their new roles, by contrast, shared
   not only a strong focus on results - necessary for early successes - but
   also excellent change-management skills. They communicated a clear
   vision, developed constructive relationships, and built team
   capabilities. They seemed to realize that the lasting value of their
   accomplishment would be the way they managed their teams through the
   transition. Collective quick wins established credibility and prepared
   them to lead their teams to harder-won victories.
   The authors provide a diagnostic tool for identifying opportunities for
   collective quick wins, and they share some advice for organizations:
   When grooming new leaders, don't just shore up their domain knowledge
   and technical skills; help them develop the change-management skills
   they will need as they settle in with their new teams.},

Abstract = {The resource-based view (RBV) has been successful in explaining the
   sustainability of competitive advantages based on the characteristics of
   individual resources but less so for understanding firm profitability
   and the reasons why profits may emerge. This article investigates the
   three conditions for a set of resources to create collectively greater
   returns that they demand from the firm, thus resulting in above-normal
   profits for its shareholders. These conditions for profitability are (a)
   value uncertainty, (b) resources specificity, and (c) firm-level
   innovation. Rather than owners of inherently superior knowledge or
   resources with limited bargaining power as usually portrayed in the RBV,
   profitable firms are fundamentally better combiners and developers of
   resources in the face of uncertainty.},

Title = {From Peer Production to Productization: A Study of Socially Enabled

Journal = {INFORMATION SYSTEMS RESEARCH},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {19},
Number = {4},
Pages = {475-493},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Peer production phenomena such as open source software (OSS) have been
   posited as a viable alternative to traditional production models.
   However, community-based development often falls short of creating
   software ``products{''} in the sense that consumers understand. Our
   research identifies an emerging business network archetype in the OSS
   sector, the open source service network (OSSN), which seeks to address
   the ``productization{''} challenge. To do so, OSSNs must overcome the
   problems associated with exchanging resources between firms. We
   demonstrate that OSSNs overcome exchange problems by primarily relying
   on social, rather than legal, mechanisms; similar to the OSS communities
   from which they emerged. This is made possible because OSSNs use IT
   infrastructures that provide high visibility for primary value-creating
   activities. The research utilizes a multimethod theory-building
   approach, deriving a model from extant research, re. ning the model
   through qualitative case study analysis, and further re. ning the model
   through quantitative analysis of survey data. The paper reveals the
   manifestation of social mechanisms in OSSNs and how these are used for
   coordinating and safeguarding exchanges between firms. Specifically, we
   illustrate the primary importance of a shared macroculture (goals and
   norms) and collective sanctions for punishing firms who violate these
   goals/norms. Furthermore, our research highlights the interplay between
   digital and social networks within OSSNs, demonstrating that the use of
   social mechanisms is inherently dependent upon the underlying IT
   infrastructure.},

Abstract = {Growing interest has emerged in viewing the multinational corporation as
   a knowledge creating and diffusing entity. The importance of sharing
   knowledge across organizational and national boundaries has been
   established in previous research. However, the question of which
   organizational policies lead to knowledge sharing between multinational
   units is still not fully understood. In particular, the link between
   compensation mechanisms and knowledge sharing has not received attention
   in previous studies. By studying 164 foreign-owned subsidiaries located
   in Finland and China, this article attempts to identify the relationship
   between subsidiary bonus pay based on MNC-wide performance and knowledge
   sharing between different units of the MNC. hi line with the
   knowledge-based perspective of the firm, the results suggest that
   incentive pay based on the collective performance of the MNC leads to
   greater knowledge sharing. Copyright (C) 2008 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Abstract = {When designing jobs, the degree of specialization is a key
   consideration. Though functional specialization allows workers to
   develop deep areas of expertise, it also increases the challenge of
   coordinating their work. In this article, we propose the concepts of
   stage- and site-based specialization and posit that together they can
   counteract the divisive effects of functional specialization. Taking
   advantage of a natural experiment in physician job design at a
   Massachusetts hospital, we explore the impact of stage- and site-based
   specialization on coordination and performance outcomes. Building on
   recent interest in relational approaches to job design, this study is
   the first to link relational job design to relational outcomes such as
   coordination. Our findings have practical implications for job design in
   professional service settings such as education, consulting, and health
   care. (C) 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

Abstract = {This paper explores a new phenomenon at the intersection of digital
   networks and organizations-the Internet-based volunteer work
   force-people who use Internet applications to pursue a personal interest
   through volunteering contributions of time and talent that may create
   value for organizations and their customers or members. This work force
   is not centrally organized, managed, or measured. It is an emergent
   phenomenon resulting from discretionary small actions taken by large
   numbers of people, enabled by technology and human initiative. This
   paper proposes a general framework for understanding the phenomenon and
   offers an empirical investigation of one component of it-the role of
   feedback in producing and sustaining high-quality contributions from
   this work force. In a comparative study of Internet-based voluntary
   technical support groups for software problems, we found that in groups
   who implement systematic quality feedback systems (compared to those
   that do not), question askers return over a longer duration, answer
   providers contribute more often, and technical problem resolution is
   more effective. We also found that with systematic feedback, volunteers
   who produce higher quality contributions have longer participation
   duration, and participation duration is positively associated with
   community maintenance contributions.},

Abstract = {This paper proposes a unified conceptual framework to analyze the
   multiple role and consequences of patents in the case of biotechnology
   research tools. We argue that the knowledge/information and
   independent/complementary nature of research tools define heterogeneous
   frameworks in which the patent system plays different roles. In
   particular, using the analogy with the free-libre open source movement
   in software, we show that patents can promote open innovation by
   ensuring the freedom of some pieces of knowledge. A strong conclusion of
   the paper is therefore that, against common belief, an adequate use of
   the patent system may contribute to preserving freedom of access to
   upstream research tools within a framework that we call free-libre

Abstract = {Resource-based theory (RBT) has emerged as a key perspective guiding
   inquiry into the determinants of organisational performance. Since the
   early 1990s, numerous studies have examined RBT's assertion that the
   extent to which organizations possess strategic resources is positively
   related to performance. Although many studies appear to support this
   assertion, there is no consensus regarding how strongly strategic
   resources relate to performance. To help resolve this issue, we
   meta-analyse 125 studies of RBT that collectively encompass over 29,000
   organisations. Our conservative estimate is that the effect size of the
   strategic resources-performance relationship is (r) over bar(c) = 0.22.
   Moderator tests suggests that the resources-performance link is stronger
   (1) when resources meet the criteria laid out in RBT and (2) for those
   performance measures that are not affected by potential value
   appropriation. When resources meet RBT's criteria and when performance
   measures are not affected by potential appropriation, the strength of
   the relationship grows to (r) over bar(c) = 0.29. This suggests that the
   identification, development, and distribution of value from strategic
   resources should be a primary consideration for scholars, managers, and
   shareholders. Copyright (C) 2008 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Abstract = {Drawing on expectancy, equity, and collective effort theories, we argue
   that the level of involvement of individual firms in multifirm alliances
   depends on both individual firms' self-focused interests and factors
   stemming from the firms' membership in the alliance group. We apply our
   theoretical arguments to the context of venture capital syndicates and
   test the hypotheses using data about 160 venture capital firms (VCFs)
   drawn from a survey instrument and a secondary data source. The results
   show that individual firms' involvement in a multifirm alliance is
   somewhat dominated by group effects; specifically, financial stake
   relative to that of the group and the reputation of the other group
   members significantly influence the focal firm's involvement. However,
   focal firms' involvement relates negatively to their own reputation. We
   discuss the implications of these findings for future research. Our
   results imply that firms in multiparty alliances pay attention to the
   characteristics of their alliance partnership to calibrate their own
   behaviour. In our specific setting, VCF involvement in syndicates
   depends more on relative syndicate characteristics than on the focal
   firm's absolute level of investment. Further, because reputation is
   negatively associated with involvement, entrepreneurs and potential
   syndicate entrants should ensure that they fully leverage VCF reputation
   to achieve their goals.},

Title = {When Teams Can't Decide},
Journal = {HARVARD BUSINESS REVIEW},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {86},
Number = {11},
Pages = {121+},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Leadership teams that can't reach consensus wait for the CEO to make the
   final call - and often are disappointed by the outcome. Frisch calls
   this phenomenon the dictator-by-default syndrome. Many companies turn to
   team-building and communication exercises to try to fix the situation.
   But that won't work, the author argues, because the trouble is not with
   the people, it's with the decision-making process. Attempting to arrive
   at a collective preference on the basis of individual opinions is
   inherently problematic. Once leadership teams realize that voting-system
   mathematics are the culprit, they can stop wasting time on irrelevant
   psychological exercises and instead adopt practical measures designed to
   break the impasse.
   They must begin by acknowledging the problem and understanding what
   causes it. When more than two options are on the table, the scene is set
   for the CEO to become a dictator by default. Even yes-or-no choices
   present difficulties, because they always include a third, implied
   alternative: ``Neither of the above.{''}
   When the CEO and the team understand why they have trouble making
   decisions, they can adopt the following tactics to minimize dysfunction:
   Clearly articulate the desired outcome, generate a range of options for
   achieving it, test ``fences{''} (which can be moved) and ``walls{''}
   (which cannot), surface preferences early, state each option's pros and
   cons, and devise new options that preserve the best features of existing
   ones.
   Teams using such tactics need to adhere to two ground rules. First, they
   must deliberate confidentially, because a secure climate for
   conversation allows members to float trial balloons and cut deals. And
   second, members must be given enough time to study their options and
   assess the counterarguments. Only then can they achieve genuine
   alignment.},

Abstract = {This study investigates the ethical climate types presented in the

   identify six ethical climate types and demonstrate significant
   difference and significant influence of the proposed relationships. This
   research contributes to the existing body of academic work by using
   empirical data collected from 820 respondents across 14 companies within
   the Korean tourism industry, to demonstrate the relationship between
   actual ethical climate types and ethical climate related factors. The
   findings of this study identify the new factor `moral caring,' which
   describes an environment characterized by decisions that maximize
   collective interest, but based on an individual employee's personal
   values and ethics. Such a factor has important implications for the
   service industry, where face-to-face encounters typify the relationship

Abstract = {This article reports the findings of a cross-cultural study that
   explored the relationship between nationality, cultural orientation, and
   attitudes toward different ways in which an employee might blow the
   whistle. The study investigated two questions - are there any
   significant differences in the attitudes of university students from
   South Korea, Turkey and the U.K. toward various ways by which an
   employee blows the whistle in an organization?, and what effect, if any,
   does cultural orientation have on these attitudes? In order to answer
   these questions, the study identified six dimensions of whistleblowing
   and four types of cultural orientation. The survey was conducted among
   759 university students, who voluntarily participated; 284 South Korean,
   230 Turkish, and 245 U.K. Although all three samples showed a preference
   for formal, anonymous and internal modes of whistleblowing, there were
   significant variations related to nationality and cultural orientation.
   The findings have some key implications for organizational practice and
   offer directions for future research.},

Abstract = {Voluntary standard-setting organizations (SSOs) are a common feature of
   systems industries, where firms supply interoperable components for a

   intellectual property rights. This paper examines the economic and
   technological significance of SSOs by analyzing the flow of citations to
   a sample of U. S. patents disclosed during the standard-setting process.
   Our main results show that the age distribution of SSO patent citations
   is shifted toward later years (relative to an average patent) and that
   citations increase substantially following standardization. These
   results suggest that SSOs identify promising technologies and influence
   their subsequent adoption.},

Abstract = {In this comparative survey of 191 Egyptian and 92 U.S. executives, we
   explore the relationship between national culture and ethical
   decision-making within the context of business. Using Reidenbach and
   Robin's (1988) multi-criteria ethics instrument, we examine how
   differences on two of Hofstede's national culture dimensions,
   individualism/collectivism, and power distance, are related to the
   manner in which business practitioners make ethical decisions. Egypt and
   the U.S. provide an interesting comparison because of the extreme
   differences in their economies and related business development. Our
   results indicate that respondents from the U.S, individualistic and low
   in power distance, were likely to view the decision making outcome in
   ethics scenarios as more unethical than the more collectivistic and high
   power distance Egyptians, when applying ethical criteria based on
   justice, utilitarianism, relativism, and (contrary to our predictions)
   egoism. However, we also found that both Egyptians and Americans rely on
   justice, utilitarianism, and relativism in predicting their intentions
   to behave ethically, and that Americans substitute egoism for justice,
   when the behavioral intentions of peers are examined.},

   explains crisis regularities such as market-wide capital immobility,

   facility. The benefit is particularly high because public and private

Abstract = {We examine the link between Internal Revenue Service (IRS) monitoring
   and yield spreads on private firms' 144A bond issues. After controlling
   for security-specific and other firm-specific determinants, we provide
   evidence that debt financing is cheaper when the probability of a
   face-to-face IRS audit is higher. Consistent with another prediction, we
   find that IRS oversight has a stronger impact on bond pricing for
   private firms with high ownership concentration, which suffer worse
   agency problems between controlling shareholders and outside investors.
   Collectively, our research implies that IRS monitoring plays a valuable
   corporate governance role by reducing information asymmetry evident in
   borrowing costs. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we explore the impact of individualism and collectivism
   on three basic aspects of ethical decision making-the perception of

   propose a pluralistic approach to post-conventional moral judgment that
   includes developmental paths appropriate for individualist and
   collectivist cultures. Finally, we argue that the link between moral
   judgment and behavior is related to individualism and collectivism.},

   Online Reverse Auctions},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {45},
Number = {5},
Pages = {550-561},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The authors model (1) the impact of the supplier's relationship
   propensity before the auction on the supplier's bidding aggressiveness
   in the auction (in terms of the number of bids it submits, the rate at
   which the bids are submitted, and the price concessions offered) and (2)
   the impact of bidding behaviors in the auction on the buyer-supplier
   relationship after auction through longitudinal survey data from 12
   online reverse auctions across various product categories. The results
   suggest that incumbency, many bidders, and a willingness to make
   specific investments lead to less aggressive bidding, whereas the total
   number of bids from competing suppliers increases aggressiveness. In
   turn, aggressive bidding behavior reduces suppliers' disposition toward
   developing a relationship with the buyer and sours incumbent
   satisfaction with the relationship. Finally, auctions that are longer in
   duration can improve the relationship but may risk bidding competition.
   Collectively, the results suggest that pricing and relationships are
   intertwined and traded off against each other in complex ways and that
   the auction does not operate in isolation of key organizational
   variables.},

Abstract = {Corporate scandals have assumed epidemic proportions. All around the
   globe, even renowned organizations have been felled from their high
   pedestals by the misdeeds of their leaders. This raises an intriguing
   question: How do such resourceful organizations end up with crass
   `impostors' as leaders in the first place? The answer perhaps lies in
   the misplaced emphasis on certain qualities we associate with
   leadership. True leadership requires a balance among three elemental
   pre-requisites: Energy, Expertise and Integrity. When they are
   synchronized, they unleash the latent potential in any organization. Out
   of these three interacting gears of leadership, it is Integrity that
   ensures that an organization is run in the right direction - with a view
   towards collective good rather than selfish motives. Therefore, it is
   the most non-negotiable of the three elements. Henceforth, leaders ought
   not to be selected on the basis of the superficial qualities that have
   blinded us in the past. They must first pass the acid test of Integrity.
   This article suggests a `decision tree' and a `checklist' to help in the
   selection process.},

Title = {How Pixar Fosters collective creativity},
Journal = {HARVARD BUSINESS REVIEW},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {86},
Number = {9},
Pages = {64+},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Many people believe that good ideas are rarer and more valuable than
   good people. Ed Catmull, president of Pixar and Disney Animation
   Studios, couldn't disagree more. That notion, he says, is rooted in a
   misguided view of creativity that exaggerates the importance of the
   initial idea in developing an original product. And it reflects a
   profound misunderstanding of how to manage the large risks inherent in
   producing breakthroughs.
   In filmmaking and many other kinds of complex product development,
   creativity involves a large number of people from different disciplines
   working effectively together to solve a great many inherently
   unforeseeable problems. The trick to fostering collective creativity,
   Catmull says, is threefold: Place the creative authority for product
   development firmly in the hands of the project leaders (as opposed to
   corporate executives); build a culture and processes that encourage
   people to share their work-in-progress and support one another as peers;
   and dismantle the natural barriers that divide disciplines.
   Mindful of the rise and fall of so many tech companies, Catmull has also
   sought ways to continually challenge Pixar's assumptions and search for
   the flaws that could destroy its culture. Clear values, constant
   communication, routine postmortems, and the regular injection of
   outsiders who will challenge the status quo are necessary but not enough
   to stay on the rails, Strong leadership is essential to make sure people
   don't pay lip service to those standards. For example, Catmull comes to
   the orientation sessions for all new hires, where he talks about the
   mistakes Pixar has made so people don't assume that just because the
   company is successful, everything it does is right.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF APPLIED PSYCHOLOGY},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {93},
Number = {5},
Pages = {945-958},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The present study examines the association between dysfunctional learn
   behavior and team performance. Data included measures of teams'
   dysfunctional behavior and negative affective tone as well as
   supervisors' ratings of teams' (nonverbal) negative emotional
   expressivity and performance. Utilizing a field sample of 61 work teams,
   the authors tested the proposed relationships with robust data analytic
   techniques. Results were consistent with the hypothesized conceptual
   scheme, in that negative team affective tone mediated the relationship
   between dysfunctional team behavior and performance when teams'
   nonverbal negative expressivity was high but not when nonverbal
   expressivity was low. On the basis of the findings, the authors conclude
   that the connection between dysfunctional behavior and performance in
   team situations is more complex than was previously believed-thereby
   yielding a pattern of moderated mediation. In sum, the findings
   demonstrated that team members' collective emotions and emotional
   processing represent key mechanisms in determining how dysfunctional
   learn behavior is associated with team performance.},

Abstract = {Culture plays an increasingly important role in information systems
   initiatives, and it receives considerable attention from researchers who
   have studied a variety of aspects of its role in IS initiatives.
   Notwithstanding the contributions of research to date, our knowledge of
   how culture influences and is influenced by-the development and use
   processes and an information system itself remains fragmented. Knowledge
   fragmentation is amplified by the fact that conceptualizations of
   culture differ among researchers. Indeed, most researchers agree that
   culture consists of patterns of meaning underlying a variety of
   manifestations. Researchers diverge, however, on the degree of consensus
   on these interpretations that they assume to be reached within a
   collective. In order to integrate these divergent conceptualizations of
   culture, we adopt the view that no single perspective is sufficient to
   capture the complexity of interplay between culture, the processes of
   developing and using an IS, and the IS itself We have, therefore,
   adopted a conceptualization that views culture from three
   perspectives-integration, differentiation, and fragmentation-that come
   into play simultaneously and jointly. Using this conceptualization, the
   paper synthesizes what is known about the role of culture in IS
   initiatives, and proposes a model of the relationships between culture,
   the development and use processes, and an information system.},

Abstract = {This study illuminates how new markets emerge and how social movements
   can effect cultural change through market creation. We suggest that
   social movements can fuel solutions to three challenges in creating new
   market segments: entrepreneurial production, the creation of collective
   producer identities, and the establishment of regular exchange between
   producers and consumers. We use qualitative data on the grassroots
   coalition movement that has spurred a market for grass-fed meat and
   dairy products in the United States since the early 1990s. Our analysis
   shows that the movement's participants mobilized broad cultural codes
   and that these codes motivated producers to enter and persist in a
   nascent market, shaped their choices about production and exchange
   technologies, enabled a collective identity, and formed the basis of the
   products' exchange value.},

Volume = {61},
Number = {8},
Pages = {1087-1115},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {A number of studies have demonstrated that humor can impact both
   horizontal and vertical relationships in organizations, but little is
   known about the interpersonal processes underlying this link. By
   integrating theory and research from the fields of philosophy, social
   psychology, communications, and leadership, it is possible to illuminate
   a combination of processes which, considered collectively, explain
   humor's ability to create, maintain, impede, or destroy relationships at
   work. I first review the classical theories of humor, which explain what
   motivates individuals to express humor and what determines humor
   enjoyment. However, since these frameworks focus on humor at the
   individual-level of analysis, they cannot speak to the social processes
   involved in a humor exchange. Research in the fields of social
   psychology, communications, and leadership provides insight regarding
   the remaining social mechanisms. In sum, it appears that interpersonal
   humor operates through four related but distinct processes:
   affect-reinforcement, similarity-attraction, self-disclosure, and
   hierarchical salience. These social processes are proposed to function
   in addition to (not in lieu of) the individual-level mechanisms the
   classical humor theories describe. The discussion, thus, culminates in a
   relational process model of humor, contributing a more fine-grained
   understanding of interpersonal humor to the organizational literature.},

   norms. It suggests that normative control, which is always problematic,
   is especially so when agents are subject to the control of two or more
   principals having divergent interests. It is argued that the agent's
   compliance will tend to flow to that principal upon whom the agent is
   most dependent. The analysis is illustrated by the case of the rise and

Abstract = {Existing theories of the firm exhibit significant shortcomings when
   questions turn to intra-organizational power and extra-organizational
   relationships - two issues central to understanding firm operations.
   Here I advance an alternative view, founded on the Montreal School of
   organizational communication's conception of conversation - text
   relations, yet extending it in several ways. In developing a
   communicative theory of the firm, I highlight the functions of, and
   relations between, `concrete' and `figurative' texts, paying particular
   attention to their participation in the construction of an authoritative
   (yet never monolithic) system for cooriented and distributed action.
   Using examples drawn from struggles over power, strategy, and
   organizational form at GM, I show that seeing the firm in textual terms
   presents a very different view of its operations. Doing so, portrays
   individuals and collectives as engaging in sophisticated games where
   firms marshal consent and attract capital through textually mediated
   practice. Moreover, through game playing, the firm's trajectory is
   authored. Building on these arguments, I present two novel and testable
   propositions about the nature of organizational change in interfirm and
   stakeholder relationships.},

Abstract = {Despite an increase in international business ethics research in recent

   respondents from Peru and China are queried about their ethical
   ideologies, firm practices, and commitment to organizational
   performance. The empirical results reveal that Chinese workers are more
   relativistic and less idealistic than their Peruvian counterparts. One
   explanation for the disparity between these two groups is likely the
   variation in collectivism that can be traced to different levels of
   importance across ingroups and outgroups. In addition to a summary of
   the results, future research directions and managerial implications are

Volume = {86},
Number = {7-8},
Pages = {50+},
Month = {JUL-AUG},
Abstract = {Managing the tension between performance and people is at the heart of
   the CEO's job. But CEOs under fierce pressure from capital markets often
   focus solely on the shareholder, which can lead to employee
   disenchantment. Others put so much stock in their firms' heritage that
   they don't notice as their organizations slide into complacency. Some
   leaders, though, manage to avoid those traps and create high-commitment,
   high-performance (HCHP) companies.
   The authors' in-depth research of HCHP CEOs reveals several shared
   traits: These CEOs earn the trust of their organizations through their
   openness to the unvarnished truth. They are deeply engaged with their
   people, and their exchanges are direct and personal. They mobilize
   employees around a focused agenda, concentrating on only one or two
   initiatives. And they work to build collective leadership capabilities.
   These leaders also forge an emotionally resonant shared purpose across
   their companies. That consists of a three-part promise: The company will
   help employees build a better world and deliver performance they can be
   proud of, and will provide an environment in which they can grow.
   HCHP CEOs approach finding a firm's moral and strategic center in a
   competitive market as a calling, not an engineering problem. They drive
   their firms to be strongly market focused while at the same time
   reinforcing their firms' core values. They are committed to short-term
   performance while also investing in long-term leadership and
   organizational capabilities. By refusing to compromise on any of these
   terms, they build great companies.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF MARKETING},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {72},
Number = {4},
Pages = {12-28},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Guanxi refers to the durable social connections and networks a firm uses
   to exchange favors for organizational purposes. This study examines how
   and when guanxi operates as a governance mechanism that influences firm
   marketing competence and performance in the transitional economy of
   China. Drawing on social capital theory, the authors propose an
   integrative framework that unbundles the benefits and risks of guanxi
   and delineates the organizational processes to internalize guanxi as a
   corporate core competence. The authors surveyed senior executives in 282
   firms in China's consumer products industries. The findings confirm
   guanxi's direct effects on market performance and its indirect effects
   mediated through channel capability and responsive capability. The
   authors also confirm that technological turbulence and competition
   intensity can be effective structure-loosening forces, thus reducing the
   governance effects of guanxi. The findings suggest that firms can
   improve market access and growth through guanxi networks, but managers
   need to capitalize on them from the personal to the corporate level. In
   addition, managers should be aware of guanxi's dark sides, which include
   reciprocal obligations and collective blindness. This study shows that
   personal networks are popular universally, but in China, they have
   unique, distinct ways of operation.},

Abstract = {This paper examines coworker networks in the American, Chinese, German,
   and Spanish divisions of a global retail bank. Because the bank has
   standardized structure and policies across countries, it is possible to
   examine how norms rooted in national culture impact on various features
   of informal ties. We propose that cultures vary in the models on which
   coworker interaction norms are based, with market, family, law, and
   friendship relations serving as alternative templates. In elucidating
   these templates, we generate hypotheses about how each culture's norms
   influence the content and structure of employees' interactions with
   coworkers. Results from an egocentric network survey largely support the
   hypotheses. We discuss implications for organizational behavior research
   on culture as well as practical implications for multinational firms.},

Abstract = {On September 11, 2001, the passengers and crew members aboard Flight 93
   responded to the hijacking of their airplane by organizing a
   counterattack against the hijackers. The airplane crashed into an
   unpopulated field, causing no damage to human lives or national
   landmarks beyond the lives of those aboard the airplane. We draw on this
   story of courageous collective action to explore the question of what
   makes this kind of action possible. We propose that to take courageous
   collective action, people need three narratives - a personal narrative
   that helps them understand who they are beyond the immediate situation
   and manage the intense emotions that accompany duress, a narrative that
   explains the duress that has been imposed upon them sufficiently to make
   moral and practical judgments about how to act, and a narrative of
   collective action - and the resources that make the creation of these
   narratives feasible. We also consider how the creation of these
   narratives is relevant to courageous collective action in more common
   organizational circumstances, and identify how this analysis suggests
   new insights into our understanding of the core framing tasks of social
   movements, ways in which social movement actors draw on social
   infrastructure, the role of discourse and morality in social movements,
   the formation of collective identity, and resource mobilization.},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {A decade after founding SKS Micro-finance, CEO Akula explains how to
   make money at the bottom tier of the economic pyramid while raising the
   living standards of the people who occupy it. His company, which
   provides many small-business loans and other financial services to poor
   women in India, has a customer base that has been nearly tripling each
   year and now numbers more than 2 million.
   Akula attributes his firm's success in part to heeding three principles:
   Adopt a profit-oriented approach in order to access commercial capital;
   boost capacity by standardizing products, training, and other processes;
   and use the latest technology to reduce costs and limit errors.
   Collectively, these for-profit maxims reflect a rethinking of the
   conventional microfinance model, which simply aims to break even,
   Instead, SKS scales up to achieve growth; the margins are razor thin,
   but the volume is staggering - 160,000 new customers every month.
   Numbers like that give the company great leverage with partners -
   insurers, telecom providers, consumer goods manufacturers, and so on
   -whose products SKS's clients need.
   Customers are indeed central to Akula's enterprise. Every SKS loan
   officer is required to do what's best for the client, even if it
   undermines the firm's short-term interests. That means everything from
   traveling far and wide to meet with prospective borrowers on their
   schedules to scratching out repayment plans in the dirt with them. Such
   commitment scales up customer loyalty, which ultimately improves the
   fortunes of not only the clients themselves but also the company and its
   investors.},

Volume = {29},

Abstract = {This paper examines the role of teaming in corporate restructuring.
   Drawing from two viewpoints of organizational learning, absorptive
   capacity and organizational improvisation, we examine whether experience
   with corporate restructuring modes (sell-offs, spin-ofts) influences
   subsequent restructuring and financial performance. Consistent with an
   absorptive capacity view, cumulative and repetitive experience with
   sell-offs was related to the adoption of an ensuing sell-off and to
   higher performance. Conversely, and consistent with an organizational
   improvisation view, short-term and contemporaneous experience with
   spin-ofts was related to the subsequent use of spin-offs and to
   increases in financial performance. The findings contribute to a dynamic
   explanation of corporate restructuring and its influence on financial
   performance, illustrate differences between learning in a repetitive
   situation and teaming when repetition is rare, and indicate when
   absorptive capacity and organizational improvisational views are most
   profitable. Overall, these findings show that different kinds of
   restructuring experiences were associated with different modes of
   restructuring and performance records. Considered collectively, the
   organizational learning perspective offers insights into why some
   corporate restructuring strategies appear as intentional and deliberate
   actions while others resemble more spontaneous and simultaneous
   responses. Copyright (C) 2008 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

   deepen our understanding of sources of variation in the era of ferment,

Abstract = {This study examines whether the framing mode (narrow versus broad)

   Motivated by the experimental evidence, which suggests that separate
   decisions are more likely to be narrowly framed than simultaneous
   decisions, we propose trade clustering as a proxy for narrow framing.
   Using this framing proxy, we show that investors who execute more
   clustered trades exhibit weaker disposition effects and hold
   better-diversified portfolios. We also find that the degree of trade
   clustering is related to investors' stock preferences and portfolio
   returns. Collectively, the evidence indicates that the choice of
   decision frames is likely to be an important determinant of investment
   decisions.},

Abstract = {This article describes several field and laboratory experiments that
   investigate an identity congruency effect on donations. Experiment 1 is
   a field experiment showing that consumers give more money to a public
   radio station if they are told that a previous donor who shares their
   identity also made a large contribution. This effect is more likely to
   occur when consumers have high collective-identity esteem (measured in
   Experiment 2a) and when attention is focused on others (manipulated in
   Experiment 2b). The authors measure these two moderators simultaneously
   and observe and replicate a three-way interaction. Again, the identity
   congruency effect is the strongest when consumers have high
   collective-identity esteem and when attention is focused on others
   (Experiment 3a and Experiment 3b). These results provide a novel
   understanding of the causes of the identity congruency effect on
   donations. The authors conclude with a discussion of the theoretical and
   substantive implications of these findings.},

Abstract = {While a large amount of work has been done to understand public good and
   to construct conceptual models explaining the antecedents of collective
   action, current literature is flawed in that most of them only examine
   the lower-level public good and attribute people's participation in
   collective action to external variables. It pays little to the
   developmental nature of collective action. Utilizing Ken Wilber's theory
   of integral psychology, this paper proposes a holistic definition of
   public good, emphasizing its different levels of development. The paper
   also introduces an integral model of collective action that explains the
   antecedents of collective action in terms of not only the external
   individual behavior and social factors but also the internal aspects of
   individuals, organization, and society.},

Title = {A transmutation theory of inter-organizational exchange relations and

Journal = {HUMAN RELATIONS},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {61},
Number = {6},
Pages = {875-899},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {This article outlines a critical realist approach to
   inter-organizational relations and networks. It reviews existing
   criticisms of the main theoretical contributions within this substantive
   topic area and argues that most have explained outcomes by referring to
   the structural antecedents that condition the different contexts which
   actors behave within. This downplays the impact of social processes and
   how these are shaped by the behavioural orientations of actors within
   these structures. Critical realism can be used to address this
   limitation. It provides a perspective on agency and social process that
   facilitates sophisticated analyses of the behavioural orientations of
   actors and how these combine to condition processes and outcomes. A
   three-step approach to analysing inter-organizational relations and
   networks is outlined and case study data are used in the effort to
   demonstrate that this approach is less susceptible to the existing
   criticisms of the field.},

Abstract = {Prior research on backing-up behavior has indicated that it is
   beneficial to teams (C. O. L. H. Porter, 2005; C. O. L. H. Porter et
   al., 2003). This literature has focused on how backing-up behavior aids
   backup recipients in tasks in which workload is unevenly distributed
   among team members. The authors of the present study examined different
   contexts of workload distribution and found that, in addition to the
   initial benefits to backup recipients, there are initial and subsequent
   costs. Backing-up behavior leads backup providers to neglect their own
   taskwork, especially when workload is evenly distributed. Team members
   who receive high amounts of backing-up behavior decrease their taskwork
   in a subsequent task, especially when a team member can observe their
   workload. These findings indicate that it is important to consider both
   the benefits and costs of engaging in backing-up behavior.},

Title = {The effort and risk-taking effects of budget-based contracts},
Journal = {ACCOUNTING ORGANIZATIONS AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {33},
Number = {4-5},
Pages = {436-452},
Month = {MAY-JUN},
Abstract = {We investigate how the budget levels embedded in budget-based contracts
   affect individual effort and risk-taking. We show that, from a wealth
   maximization perspective, a tradeoff exists between motivating effort
   and encouraging risk-taking. We illustrate an inverted-U relation
   between budget levels and effort. Budget levels and effort are
   positively correlated until budgets become very difficult, at which
   point individuals ``give up.{''} We illustrate an opposing, U-shaped,
   relation between budget levels and risk-taking. Low budgets provide the
   flexibility to take greater risks, whereas high budgets induce
   individuals to ``play it safe{''} to ensure budget attainment. Risky
   projects provide the greatest probability of reaching very high
   (stretch) budgets. We conduct a laboratory experiment to empirically
   test this economic proposition vis-A-vis extant psychology research.
   Consistent with security-potential/aspiration theory, we find that
   individuals are willing to sacrifice expected wealth to either meet the
   budget or increase their potential payoffs. Our results suggest that the
   effort-risk tradeoff is mitigated at low budget levels, thereby
   increasing firm welfare, but is exacerbated at high budget levels,
   reducing firm welfare. Collectively, our results highlight the
   importance of understanding how managerial accounting practices such as
   budgets affect the various determinants of performance and not just
   performance per se. Our results also help reconcile conflicting evidence
   regarding where budget difficulty levels should be set. (c) 2007

Title = {The impact of power and relationship commitment on the integration

Journal = {JOURNAL OF OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {26},
Number = {3},
Pages = {368-388},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Supply chain integration (SCI) has received increasing attention from
   scholars and practitioners in recent years. However, our knowledge of
   what influences SCI is still very limited. Although marketing and
   management researchers have investigated power and relationship
   commitment issues between organizations, few have examined their impact
   on SCI. This paper extends the power-relationship commitment theory
   established in Western marketing literature and links it with SCI in
   China, through examining the relationship between power, relationship
   commitment and the integration between manufacturers and their
   customers. We propose and empirically test a model using data collected
   from 617 manufacturing companies in China. The results show that
   different types of customer power impact manufacturers' relationship
   commitment in different ways. Expert power, referent power and reward
   power are important in improving manufacturers' normative relationship
   commitment, while reward power and coercive power enhance instrumental
   relationship commitment. We also found that normative relationship
   commitment had a greater impact on customer integration than
   instrumental relationship commitment. These findings are interpreted in
   light of national culture differences between China and the U.S. in
   terms of power distance and collectivism, which provide a new
   perspective on SCI. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {I investigate ultimate control and ownership patterns in Russian

   Private owners widely exploit legal loopholes that allow them to mask

   reveals that the typical anonymous owners are insiders and that in
   virtually all cases the market participants ``know{''} who the real

   across product categories and retail stores. Examining nearly 370,000
   inventory records from 37 stores of one retailer, we find 65\% to be
   inaccurate. We characterize the distribution of IRI and show, using
   hierarchical linear modeling (HLM), that 26.4\% of the total variance in
   IRI lies between product categories and that 2.7\% lies between stores.
   We identify several factors that mitigate record inaccuracy, such as
   inventory auditing practices, and several factors that exacerbate record
   inaccuracy, such as the complexity of the store environment and the
   distribution structure. Collectively, these covariates explain 67.6\%
   and 69.0\% of the variance in IRI across stores and product categories,
   respectively. Our findings underscore the need to design processes to
   reduce the occurrence of IRI and highlight factors that can be
   incorporated into inventory planning tools developed to account for its
   presence.},

Abstract = {``Small treasuries{''} (xiaojinku) are off-book accounts found in many
   large enterprises in China for the purpose of rewarding managers and
   their subordinates, building up guanxi (personal networks), and even
   financing the business operations of their danwei (work units). We
   analyze CESTs with reference to their antecedents, constructs, and
   consequences. Our analysis indicates that while CESTs can, in some
   cases, help organizations deal with immediate financial problems, they
   have negative impacts on organizational performance in relation to the
   moral hazard of managers, as well as the allocation of organizational
   resources, in respect of sustainability of strategic advantages and
   growth, and mismanagement of organizations. Because of the involutionary
   behavior of managers in Chinese enterprises, we propose that it will
   require not only organizational controls, but also a fundamental change
   in these managers' ideology for solving the problems of CESTs.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to critically examine the
   institutionalization of demand-driven modes of working in the R\&D
   planning process and reveal possible weaknesses, through an analysis of
   a system of collective R\&D funding by farmers. The findings indicate
   that, although end-users have the opportunity to raise issues that lead
   to R\&D, queries are influenced by several actors in the R\&D planning
   process in such a way that they do not adequately reflect farmers'
   innovation needs. Conclusions are that more emphasis is required on
   joint demand articulation and involvement of end-users and other
   stakeholders in the innovation process, and on the institutional
   development of R\&D funding organizations in order to adopt a more
   inclusive view on innovation. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Journal = {JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ETHICS},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {79},
Number = {1-2},
Pages = {43-55},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {This paper studies the relationship between organizational ethical
   climate and the forms of organizational citizenship behavior (OCB),
   including in-role and extra-role behaviors, and examines the mediating
   effect of employee loyalty. A sample of employees from a traditional
   Hong Kong-based company was used as a study group. The purpose of this
   study was to examine the causes and implications of how various ethical
   work climates affect employee performance. Based on a model proposed by
   Victor and Cullen, ethical climate is arranged from lower levels to
   higher levels. The results suggest that lower levels of ethical climate
   (instrumentality and independence), characterizing a weak relational
   contract between employee and employer, are associated with negative
   extra-role behavior. In contrast, higher levels of ethical climate
   (caring and law-and-code), symbolic of a strong relational contract at
   work, are associated with positive extra-role behavior. Moreover,
   normative commitment mediated a positive relationship between caring and
   identification with the company, whereas attitudinal loyalty mediated
   the negative relationship between independence and altruism.
   Implications for future research and practice are discussed.},

Abstract = {This article applies the dialectical logic of loose coupling to
   interpartner exchanges in order to analyze the dynamics of global
   strategic alliances. We develop a typology of control and cooperation
   that defines alliance states or situations according to their level of
   cooperation under private and collective control. In the private
   control-cooperation interplay, contending, honeymoon, and coopetition
   situations arise, depending on the levels of private control and
   cooperation. In the collective control-cooperation interplay, the
   loosely connected, the equity hostage, the tightly integrated, and the
   trusting states emerge according to the levels of collective control and
   cooperation. We illustrate how an individual partner strategically
   responds to the control cooperation interplay under each situation or
   state, and develop hypotheses explicating how these strategic responses
   are influenced by relational characteristics such as goal congruity,
   resource complementarity, and bargaining asymmetry between foreign and
   local partners.},

Abstract = {We integrate the resource-based view, transaction cost economics, and

   small-to-medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in environments of weak
   infrastructure and institutions help them achieve greater collective
   efficiencies and access to global markets. Using survey data from 232
   Argentine furniture SMEs, we found that different types of ties matter
   in different ways for these SMEs' collective efficiencies. For instance,
   vertical ties yield manufacturing productivity along the supply chain,
   while horizontal ties enable collective resource use as well as joint
   product innovation. These collective efficiencies, in turn, serve as
   competitive currencies helping SMEs access global markets.},

Abstract = {This paper studies collective-action games in which the production of a
   public good requires teamwork. A leading example is a threshold game in
   which provision requires the voluntary participation of m out of n
   players. Quantal-response strategy revisions allow play to move between
   equilibria in which a team successfully provides, and an equilibrium in
   which the collective action fails. A full characterization of long-run
   play reveals the determinants of success; these include the correlation
   between players' costs of provision and their valuations for the good.
   The addition of an extra ``bad apple{''} player can ``spoil the
   barrel{''} by destabilizing successful teams and so offers a rationale
   for limiting the pool of possible contributors.},

Abstract = {The challenge of organizational adaptation is often presented in terms
   of the tension between the exploration of new possibilities and the
   exploitation of existing accomplishments. Whether framed in the language
   of invention versus refinement or local search versus long jumps, the
   spirit of the argument is of an explicit trade-off that
   resource-constrained organizations must make to secure their survival
   and success. While we do not dispute the fundamental truth that
   underlies this tension, we do believe this dominant characterization of
   the process of exploration may be masking key drivers of this tension
   and potential paths towards its resolution. We argue that, from the
   perspective of an actor, all activities are inherently exploitative in
   their nature, in the sense that they are undertaken with the explicit
   expectation that they may achieve meaningful progress on some dimension
   of performance. The key distinction regards the extent to which the
   dimension of performance is recognized and legitimated from the
   perspective of the organizational context in which the actor is
   operating. Acts perceived as `exploratory' are, thus, more accurately
   characterized as acts of exploitation directed along new performance
   dimensions. We consider the organizational challenges that such
   exploratory action poses and the implications for entrepreneurial
   initiatives. From the perspective of the focal actor engaged in the
   exploratory initiative, the challenge is to identify `projections' of
   the payoff of the initiative they are pursuing, either onto those
   dimensions of performance that are of interest to the organization, or
   onto more concrete measures of product-market acceptance and financial
   return. Low-dimensional representations of the business landscape are an
   inevitable by-product of bounded rationality and the need for
   organizations and their strategies to coordinate and direct collective
   action. In this regard, the most powerful form of entrepreneurship may
   be the initiation of the cognitive shifts that offer a different
   topology of the competitive landscape. Copyright (C) 2008 Strategic

Abstract = {This article maintains that the consistent application of subjectivism
   helps reconcile contemporary entrepreneurship theory with the strategic

   The article synthesizes theoretical insights from Austrian economics,

   focusing on the essential subjectivity of the entrepreneurial process.
   This new synthesis describes entrepreneurship as a creative team act in
   which heterogeneous managerial mental models interact to create and
   arrange resources to produce a collective output that is creatively

Title = {Self-perception-based versus transference-based trust determinants in

Volume = {24},

Abstract = {This study examines the impact of culture on trust determinants in
   computer-mediated commerce transactions. Adopting trust-building
   foundations from cross-culture literature and focusing on a set of
   well-established cultural constructs as groups of culture (Type I and
   Type 11), this study develops a theoretical model of
   self-perception-based versus transference-based consumer trust in
   e-vendors, and empirically tests the model using cross-cultural data.
   The results show that transference-based trust determinants (i.e.,
   ``perceived importance of third-party seal{''} and ``perceived
   importance of positive referral{''}) are more positively related to
   consumer trust in e-vendors in a Type II (i.e., collectivist-strong
   uncertainty avoidance-high long-term orientation-high context) culture
   than in a Type I (i.e., individualistic-weak uncertainty avoidance-low
   long-term orientation-low context) culture. Unlike the initial
   hypothesized expectations, self-perception-based trust determinants
   (i.e., perceived security protection, perceived privacy concern, and
   perceived system reliability) do not show stronger roles to consumer
   trust in e-vendors in a Type I culture than in a Type II culture,
   although the stronger negative effect of perceived privacy concerns is
   observed on consumer trust in e-vendors in a Type I culture than in a
   Type II culture. Theoretical contributions for e-commerce cross-culture
   literature and implications for multinational online business managers
   are discussed.},

Abstract = {Given the assumption that most employers would like to gain the trust of
   their employees, what would initiate this trust? This study explores the
   joint role of the employee-organization relationship (EOR) and
   supervisory sup-port in initiating trust among middle managers. The
   results from a study of 545 middle managers in China show that both EOR
   and supervisory support are important in creating trust, with
   supervisory support having a stronger influence than EOR. Further,
   supervisors play a synergistic role by accentuating the positive
   influence of the mutual investment EOR approach and attenuating the
   negative influence of the quasi-spot contract EOR with the managers.
   Results reinforce the importance of both formal structure and social
   processes in cultivating employee trust in the organization. We discuss
   implications of these findings for future research and human resource

Year = {2008},
Volume = {77},
Number = {4},
Pages = {463-479},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {In this article, we analyzed the effect of various factors on moral
   judgment and ethical attitudes of working persons. It was found that the
   effect of various socio-demographic factors on ethical attitudes varied
   between the two different categories of ethical issues under study,
   issues which involve explicit violation of laws vis-a-vis issues which
   involved social concerns. Our results did not support the implication of
   Callahan's hypothesis that males are more sensitive to rule-based
   ethical issues while women are to issues involving social concerns; it
   was found that females have a lower acceptability of unethical behaviors
   related to both categories of issues in Hong Kong, whereas gender effect
   was not statistically significant in Mainland China. University
   education also had no significant effect on ethical attitudes. Religion
   played an important role in affecting ethical attitudes, however, its
   effect varied with different types of religions; Christianity was found
   to be most favorable to higher ethical standards, but people of
   traditional Chinese religion had a higher acceptability of unethical
   behaviors involving social concerns compared to people with no religion.
   Our finding also indicated that employees in state-owned enterprises,
   private employees, employees in foreign-investment firms, and employers
   in Mainland China all had a higher acceptability of unethical
   law-breaking behaviors compared to workers in collectives, throwing
   doubt on the validity of convergence theory in Mainland China.},

Abstract = {Based on three case studies, we constructed an inductive process model

   phases through which an escalating interaction process that culminates
   in collective turnover unfolds. First, two or more members of an
   organizational group experience unresolved dissatisfaction with some
   aspect of their organization. Second, individual negative experiences
   are transformed into shared group perceptions through group sensemaking
   and emotional contagion that occurs in cohesive groups that view
   themselves as superior to others. Third, when group members feel no hope
   of improvement but have other opportunities available and few
   constraints on leaving, they collectively decide to leave their
   organization, begin searching for placements, and, turn over. We propose
   theoretical and practical implications of this model.},

Title = {Using the PET assessment instrument to help students identify factors

Journal = {JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ETHICS},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {77},
Number = {2},
Pages = {129-145},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {We present an instrument developed to explain to students the concept of
   the personal ethical threshold (PET). The PET represents an individual's
   susceptibility to situational pressure in his or her organization that
   makes moral behavior more personally difficult. Further, the PET varies
   according to the moral intensity of the issue at hand, such that
   individuals are less vulnerable to situational pressure for issues of
   high moral intensity, i.e., those with greater consequences for others.
   A higher PET reflects an individual's greater likelihood of adhering to
   the morally correct path, even in the face of high situational pressures
   (personal costs) and low moral intensity (collective importance). PET
   questionnaires were completed by 506 students representing eight
   business schools throughout the United States. Relationships between
   respondents' PET and their gender, age, and major field of study, as
   well as the geographical location of their school, are explored. Results
   indicate that older students have higher PETs and that students

Title = {The language of teamwork: Reproducing professional divisions in the

Journal = {HUMAN RELATIONS},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {61},
Number = {1},
Pages = {103-130},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Bringing together arguments from organizational studies and medical
   sociology, this study views teamwork as a discursive resource through
   which the social world is constituted in particular ways. Drawing upon
   an ethnographic case study of the operating theatre department, the
   nature and effects of these constitutive practices are examined.
   Significantly, this article argues that rather than unifying the
   professions, teamwork produces unintended divisive effects. Teamwork is
   used to promote unity, whilst at the same time pursuing divergent
   professional interests around the nature of collectivity. Employing
   distinct interpretive repertoires, professions construct different
   versions of team work and make competing legitimacy claims. These
   discursive practices both reflect and reproduce structural inequality
   between the professions. Ultimately, the privileged position of surgeons
   and anaesthetists over nurses and operating department practitioners is
   legitimated and maintained. This discursive action has far-reaching
   effects beyond the control of team members, with implications for
   policy-makers and organizational management. Exposing its performative
   and ideological nature, this analysis highlights teamwork discourse as
   co-constitutive with the structural context in which it occurs. The
   importance of critical reflection on the nature of teamwork as a concept
   is demonstrated.},

Abstract = {Code reuse is a form of knowledge reuse in software development that is
   fundamental to innovation in many fields. However, to date there has
   been no systematic investigation of code reuse in open source software
   projects. This study uses quantitative and qualitative data gathered
   from a sample of six open source software projects to explore two sets
   of research questions derived from the literature on software reuse in
   firms and open source software development. We find that code reuse is
   extensive across the sample and that open source software developers,
   much like developers in firms, apply tools that lower their search costs
   for knowledge and code, assess the quality of software components, and
   have incentives to reuse code. Open source software developers reuse
   code because they want to integrate functionality quickly, because they
   want to write preferred code, because they operate under limited
   resources in terms of time and skills, and because they can mitigate
   development costs through code reuse.},

Abstract = {In the face of systemic challenges to corporate legitimacy, scholars and
   managers alike have been rethinking traditional answers to the question:
   What does it take to be a good company? We approach this question in two
   novel ways. We offer a normative answer, grounded in virtue ethics, by
   introducing a threefold typology of organizational forms. The moral
   goodness of each form depends on the congruence between its purpose and
   virtues. But we also offer a positive answer in the form of a processual
   model which traces corporate goodness to its empirical antecedents and
   consequences. The model defies a view of organizations as innately good
   or evil, but rather portrays virtue as the sediment of a value infusion
   process. We predict that if managers succeed in establishing in their
   organizations the kind of virtues necessary to support collective moral
   agency, they can expect to reap gains like enhanced effectiveness and
   legitimacy. However, when they neglect their moral responsibilities, the
   result will likely be organizational demise.},

Abstract = {Decision making groups often exchange and integrate distributed
   information to a lesser extent than is desirable for high-quality
   decisions. We propose that group members' shared task representations
   play an important role in this respect, because groups are often
   insufficiently attuned to the task's information elaboration
   requirements. Task representations emphasizing elaboration of
   decision-relevant information should therefore enhance decision-making
   performance. This should hold especially when group members realize that
   they share these task representations, because this realization removes
   psychological barriers to introducing new insights. Testing these
   hypotheses, we compared information elaboration and decision-making
   performance of control groups and groups receiving instructions
   emphasizing information elaboration in two experiments. Half of the
   experimental groups were also made to realize that they shared the
   elaboration instructions. As predicted, groups with task representations
   emphasizing information elaboration and the realization they shared
   these representations outperformed groups in the other conditions. This
   effect was mediated by information elaboration. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

Volume = {86},
Number = {1},
Pages = {123+},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Unless we challenge long-held assumptions about how business leaders are
   supposed to act and where they're supposed to come from, many people who
   could become effective global leaders will remain invisible, warns
   Harvard Business School professor Hill. Instead of assuming that leaders
   must exhibit take-charge behavior, broaden the definition of leadership
   to include creating a context in which other people are willing and able
   to guide the organization. And instead of looking for the next
   generation of global leaders in huge Western corporations and elite
   business schools, expand the search to developing countries.
   In this conversation with HBR senior editor Paul Hemp, Hill describes
   the changing nature of leadership and what we can learn from parts of
   the world where people have not, until recently, had opportunities to
   become globally savvy executives. In South Africa, for instance, the
   African National Congress has provided rigorous leadership preparation
   for many black executives. Hill has also observed two approaches - in
   developed and developing economies alike -that she believes will be
   necessary in an increasingly complex business environment. The first,
   leading from behind, involves letting people hand off the reins to one
   another, depending on their strengths, as situations change. The second,
   leadership as collective genius, calls for both unleashing and
   harnessing individuals' collective talents, particularly to spur
   innovation.
   Through her descriptions of these approaches in such companies as
   Sekunjalo Investments, HCL Technologies, and IBM, Hill highlights the
   challenges of finding and preparing people who can lead by stepping back
   and letting others come forward to make their own judgments and take
   risks.},

Abstract = {I propose an alternative approach to industry classification that
   reflects the way in which firms self-organize into industries and
   sectors. The systems-based approach to industry classification takes the
   sector as the primary unit of analysis, defines a sector on the basis of
   similarity in needs to which firms collectively respond, and
   disaggregates sectors into subsectors and industries on the basis of
   recursive hierarchical dependency. The result is an approach to industry
   classification that reflects industry structure, reduces egregious cases
   of between-class homogeneity and within-class heterogeneity, and
   accommodates changes in technology. The approach is illustrated in a
   communications equipment subsector application. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Title = {A distributed cognition perspective on newcomers' change processes: The
   management of cognitive uncertainty in two investment banks},
Journal = {ADMINISTRATIVE SCIENCE QUARTERLY},
Year = {2007},
Volume = {52},
Number = {4},
Pages = {507-557},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {This paper examines newcomers' cognitive change processes in two
   investment banks during their socialization. A two-year ethnographic
   study examines how the two banks managed the duration of junior bankers'
   cognitive uncertainty differently, which resulted in distinct forms of
   individual cognitive change and cognition at the organizational level.
   Red Bank reduced cognitive uncertainty such that bankers experienced it
   as transient. It conveyed abstract concepts so that bankers could solve
   problems independently using deduction. This created an
   individual-centric organizational cognition. To highlight situational
   uniqueness, Amp Bank amplified cognitive uncertainty such that bankers
   experienced it as persistent. This created a collective-centric
   organizational cognition: because demands exceeded individuals'
   cognitive capacity, bankers used organizational resources to solve
   problems inductively. A grounded theory depicts the mutual constitution
   of individual and organizational cognition, including the relation of
   these levels over time and how the same individual cognitive process
   operates differently in a different organizational cognitive context. It
   uses a distributed cognition framework to contribute to theory
   development on how cognition becomes diversified and specialized in
   organizations.},

Abstract = {Entrepreneurs are often portrayed as rugged individualists who go it
   alone to build new organizations and programs that maximize their
   self-interests. This portrayal is incomplete, because it does not
   account for the fact that entrepreneurs also pursue collective
   interests. It fails to recognize a basic paradox in human beings of
   simultaneously seeking individual and collective interests. We argue
   that an appreciation of the dialectical nature of human beings leads to
   fundamentally different conceptions of entrepreneurship than those
   commonly found in literature on entrepreneurship theory and practice. To
   illustrate our central premise, we focus on entrepreneurial opportunity
   realization, resource mobilization, and running in packs. Copyright (C)

Volume = {38},
Number = {6},
Pages = {855-877},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Building on economic and social exchange theories, this study develops
   an integrated model in which curtailing opportunism in international
   joint ventures (IJVs) requires four interrelated sets of suppressing
   forces: (1) contractual ordering (contractual inclusiveness and
   contractual obligatoriness); (2) structural ordering (managerial
   governance and equity captiveness); (3) relational ordering (interparty
   attachment and boundary-spanner ties); and (4) justice ordering
   (procedural justice and distributive justice). Using a sample of 192
   lJVs in an emerging market, this study finds general support for our
   theoretical model. Our research validates that countering opportunism
   involves a system-wide effort that integrates economic and social
   mandates, unifies ex ante and ex post mechanisms, controls both egoistic
   and non-egoistic motivations, and combines organizational-level and
   individual-level forces. For partners from individualist cultures,
   economic ordering forces (contractual and structural) are stronger than
   social ordering forces (relational and justice) in relation to
   opportunism resistance, whereas for partners from a collectivistic
   culture, social ordering forces are relatively stronger than economic
   ordering forces for this end.},

   of the user's entrepreneurial process. Users are often `accidental'
   entrepreneurs who happen upon an idea through their own use and then
   share it with others; more specifically, the development of an idea and
   subsequent experimentation, adaptation, and preliminary adoption often
   occur before that idea is formally evaluated as the basis of a
   commercial venture. Users also tend to engage in collective creative
   activity prior to firm formation-often within the social context
   provided by user communities-that results in the improvement of ideas.

   and suffer many health problems from mouth-blowing a clay pot filled

   established a factory and self-help, micro-credit collectives to enable
   other villagers to improve their socioeconomic condition. The case
   chronicles the project's development, including opportunity recognition,
   and new technology development and implementation. An overview of the

Abstract = {This paper examines the impact of take-back laws within a
   manufacturer/remanufacturer competitive framework. Take-back laws
   require that firms take responsibility for the collection/disposal costs
   of their products. We consider two alternative implementations of
   take-back laws that are distinguished by the degree of control that the
   manufacturer has on returns sold to the remanufacturer. In one
   implementation, known as collective WEEE take-back, the manufacturer has
   no control over returns sold to the remanufacturer. The other
   implementation, known as individual WEEE take-back, gives complete
   control to the manufacturer. We develop a general two-period model to
   investigate questions of interest to policy-makers in government and
   managers in industry. Our results suggest that, in some settings,
   enactment of collective WEEE take-back will result in higher
   manufacturer and remanufacturer profits while simultaneously spurring
   remanufacturing activity and reducing the tax burden on society. A
   negative effect is higher consumer prices in the market. In other
   settings, we find that collective WEEE take-back introduces a structural
   change to the industry-creating an environment where remanufacturing
   becomes profitable when it is not profitable without a take-back law.
   With respect to individual WEEE take-back, we find that the manufacturer
   often benefits from allowing the remanufacturer to enter the market,
   though from a government policy-maker perspective, there are clear risks
   of monopolistic behavior. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The effects two values held by founder-CEOs (collectivism and novelty)
   on companies' post-start-up performance are investigated. By integrating
   congruence and organizational lifecycle literatures, the authors
   hypothesized that the effects of both values are moderated by company
   age and size, such that collectivism exerts stronger beneficial effects
   in older and larger firms, whereas novelty exerts stronger beneficial
   effects in younger and smaller firms. Results based on 92 small- to
   medium-sized enterprises offer support for most predictions, thus
   demonstrating the influence of founders' values on new venture

   members settled on a shared conception of authority, it was more

Abstract = {Given the recent ethics scandals in the United States, there has been a
   renewed focus on understanding the antecedents to ethical
   decision-making in the research literature. Since ethical norms and
   standards of behavior are not universally consistent, an individual's
   choice of referent may exert a large influence on his/her ethical
   decision-making. This study used a social identity theory lens to
   empirically examine the relative influence of the macro- and micro-level
   variables of national culture and peers on an individual's intention to
   behave ethically. Our sample consisted of respondents from Germany,
   Italy, and Japan. The results indicated that both national culture and
   peers were found to act as significant referents in ethical
   decision-making dilemmas. Although peers exerted a much stronger
   influence on an individual's ethical decision-making, the impact of
   peers varied depending on the national culture levels of individualism
   and power distance.},

   business ethics},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ETHICS},
Year = {2007},
Volume = {74},
Number = {3},
Pages = {253-266},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Kant is gaining popularity in business ethics because the categorical
   imperative rules out actions such as deceptive advertising and
   exploitative working conditions, both of which treat people merely as
   means to an end. However, those who apply Kant in this way often hold
   businesses themselves morally accountable, and this conception of
   collective responsibility contradicts the kind of moral agency that
   underlies Kant's ethics. A business has neither inclinations nor the
   capacity to reason, so it lacks the conditions necessary for constraint
   by the moral law. Instead, corporate policies ought to be understood as
   analogous to legal constraints. They may encourage or discourage certain
   actions, but they cannot determine a person's maxim - which for Kant is
   the focus of moral judgment. Because there is no collective intention
   apart from any intentions of the individual agents who act as members of
   the corporation, an organization itself has no moral obligations. This
   poses a dilemma: either apply the categorical imperative to the actions
   of particular businesspeople and surrender the notion of collective
   responsibility, or apply a different moral theory to the actions of
   businesses themselves. Given the diffusion of responsibility in a
   bureaucracy, the explanatory usefulness of collective responsibility may
   force business ethicists to abandon Kant's moral philosophy.},

Volume = {104},
Number = {1},
Pages = {61-82},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {This study develops a culture-contingent model of trust formation in
   emergent relationships by comparing how trust-warranting signs shape
   attributions of trustworthiness to unfamiliar trustees in collectivist
   versus individualist cultures. We predict and find that the
   effectiveness of dispositional and contextual signs varies
   systematically depending on trustors' national culture. Collectivists
   tend to rely less on dispositional signs and more on situational signs
   than individualists. This difference fosters distinct trust-building
   pathways. Individualists bestow trust based on a trustee's perceived
   ability and integrity, collectivists' trusting choices depend to a
   greater extent on predictable, benevolent interactions with a potential
   partner. These findings suggest that, in cross-cultural encounters,
   signs aligned with trustors' cultural expectations hasten trust
   production. Mismatched signs are impotent, even off-putting. (c) 2007

Title = {Leveraging standard electronic business interfaces to enable adaptive
   supply chain partnerships},
Journal = {INFORMATION SYSTEMS RESEARCH},
Year = {2007},
Volume = {18},
Number = {3},
Pages = {260-279},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Adaptive supply chain partnerships are a key factor in driving the
   ability of extended enterprise partners to achieve long-term goals in an
   environment characterized by disruptive environmental shifts. Adaptive
   extended enterprise arrangements allow participating enterprises to
   leverage their combined assets for collective exploration and
   exploitation. In the context of extended enterprises, where significant
   investments have been directed toward instituting common interfaces,
   this study examines the question: How does the use of standard
   electronic business interfaces (SEB1s) enable supply chain partnerships
   to become more adaptive?
   This study conceptualizes the use of SEBIs as a boundary-spanning
   mechanism that helps overcome boundaries that impede knowledge transfer
   between enterprises in supply chains. SEBIs enables partners to gain
   insight into their broader environments, enriching each partner's
   perspective (enhanced bridging). SEBIs also help strengthen the
   cooperative ties between partners, motivating each partner to adapt for
   collective gain (enhanced bonding).
   Our research model is empirically tested using data collected from 41
   demand-side supply chain partnerships (between original equipment
   manufacturers (OEMs), distributors, and retailers) in the information
   technology (IT) industry. The results show that collaborative
   information exchange (CIE) between supply chain partners mediates the
   relationship between use of SEBIs and mutual adaptation (MA) and
   adaptive knowledge creation between supply chain partners.
   Interestingly, the use of SEBIs is found to be directly associated with
   MA but only indirectly associated with adaptive knowledge creation.
   The study points out that the strategic impacts of SEBIs go well beyond
   the exchange of transaction information and process integration. It also
   shows that multilateral, quasi-open, and information exchange-and
   process linkage-oriented SEBIs can result in both bonding and bridging
   across supply chain partners without binding them inflexibly to specific
   partners. Based on the model and results, the study offers practical
   implications for how SEBIs should be developed, adopted, and used.},

Year = {2007},
Volume = {60},

Pages = {1331-1360},

Abstract = {This article examines the role of leadership in mobilizing collective
   resistance in the workplace. Given the scarcity of dialogue between
   critical scholars and leadership studies, relatively little
   consideration is given to the role of leadership in resisting and
   potentially transforming structures of domination. The article describes
   some of the reasons why these areas of research have produced so little
   mutual work. We then make the argument that theories of leadership can
   be useful to the study of resistance by providing a grounded approach to
   theorizing agency, highlighting the role of mobilization and influence
   in change, and emphasizing participant attributions. In doing so,
   leadership studies gain important insights about the influence of deep
   structure power issues on perceptions of leaders, as well as material
   and symbolic limits on mobilization. The article adopts a dialectical
   perspective as a way of understanding issues of resistance leadership,
   and then discusses how existing literatures, read with this dialectical
   approach, can be brought to bear on significant questions concerning the
   practices of resistance leadership.},

Title = {Introduction to the special issue on innovative data sources for

Abstract = {All research methods have strengths and weaknesses. The two dominant
   empirical methodologies in operations management are the survey and the
   case study. Reliance on a limited number of methodologies can influence
   the body of knowledge that that a field generates - and even the
   problems that the field collectively chooses to investigate or not
   investigate. The special issue attempts to ``push the envelope{''} in
   terms of the data sources used in operations management. In particular,
   the following data sources are used: laboratory study, customer comment
   data, third-party web site quality ratings, process characteristics
   collected from e-commerce web sites themselves, environmental
   performance reports, and a publicly available research database.
   Researchers contemplating their data gathering strategy must consider
   the strengths and weaknesses of each approach. The introduction to
   special issue discusses positives and negatives of both conventional and
   innovative data sources. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {The process management triangle: An empirical investigation of process
   trade-offs},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2007},
Volume = {25},

Pages = {1015-1034},
Month = {AUG 31},
Abstract = {Advancing theory and understanding of process management issues
   continues to be a central concern for operations management research and
   practice. While an insightful body of knowledge - based primarily on
   studies at the process-level exists on the management of capacity and
   inventory, the dynamism characterizing most operating and competitive
   systems poses an ongoing challenge for managers having to mitigate the
   impact of variability across different levels of operating systems
   (e.g., production processes, facilities, and supply chains). This paper
   builds on a conceptual framework, derived from queuing theory and termed
   the ``process management triangle{''}, to explore the extent to which
   fundamental trade-offs between capacity utilization, variability and
   inventory (CVI) generalize to complex operations and business systems.
   To do so, empirical analyses utilizing comparatively unique data for the
   study of these process management issues - and collected from two
   distinct, vastly different levels of analysis - are presented. First, a
   simulation-based facility-level analysis using teaching case study data
   is presented. Second, an industry-level analysis employing archival
   economic data spanning three multi-year periods is considered.
   Collectively, these empirical analyses provide exploratory support for
   the generalization and extension of analytical insights on CVI
   trade-offs to both complex operations and business systems, although
   with decreasing explanatory power. The implications of these studies for
   furthering process management theory and understanding are framed around
   additional research propositions intended to guide future investigation
   of CVI trade-offs. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {We investigated the attempt of a high-technology R\&D organization to
   transform into a market-oriented organization by ``grafting{''} new,
   nontechnological knowledge. The intended strategic transformation did
   not succeed for reasons with wide implications for theory and research.
   Our findings suggest that the intersection of organizational identity,
   knowledge, and practice hindered the development of the new knowledge
   and undermined the broader strategic transformation effort itself. The
   failure of the graft revealed a previously underrecognized relationship
   between identity and knowledge that manifested itself in organization
   members' efforts to preserve the collective practices that characterized
   how they used knowledge in accomplishing their work.},

   according to the scientific curricula of the inventors. The first cup
   consists of patents whose inventors are all authors of at least one
   scientific publication in NST, while the second is made up of patents
   invented by individuals who have no scientific publication in the field.
   Thirdly, we isolated those patents that have at least one inventor who
   is also author of at least one scientific publication in NST. The
   underlining presumption of this classification is that of a proxy of
   different institutional complementarities of inventive collective action

Title = {Familiarity, complexity, and team performance in geographically

Journal = {ORGANIZATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2007},
Volume = {18},
Number = {4},
Pages = {613-630},

Abstract = {While prior research has found that familiarity is beneficial to team
   performance, it is not clear whether different kinds of familiarity are
   more or less beneficial when the work has different types of complexity.
   In this paper, we theorize how task and team familiarity interact with
   task and team coordination complexity to influence team performance. We
   posit that task familiarity is more beneficial with more complex tasks
   (i.e., tasks that are larger or with more complex structures) and that
   team familiarity is more beneficial when team coordination is more
   difficult (i.e., for larger or geographically dispersed teams). Finally,
   we propose that the effects of task familiarity and team familiarity on
   team performance are complementary. Based on a field study of
   geographically distributed software teams, two of our hypotheses are
   disconfirmed: Our results show that the beneficial effects of task
   familiarity decline when tasks are more structurally complex and are
   independent of task size. Conversely, the hypotheses for team
   familiarity are confirmed as the benefit of team familiarity for team
   performance is enhanced when team coordination is more challenging-i.e.,
   when teams are larger or geographically dispersed. Finally,
   surprisingly, we find that task and team familiarity are more
   substitutive than complementary in their joint effects on team
   performance: Task familiarity improves team performance more strongly
   when team familiarity is weak and vice versa. Our study contributes by
   revealing how different types of familiarity can enhance team
   performance in a real-world setting where the task and its coordination
   can be highly complex.},

Abstract = {Work-family conflict research has focused almost exclusively on
   professional, White adults. The goal of this article was to expand the
   understanding of culture and industry in shaping experiences and
   consequences of work-family conflict. Using in-depth interview data (n =
   26) and structured survey data (n = 200) from immigrant Latinos employed
   in the poultry processing industry, the authors evaluated predictions
   drawn from emerging models emphasizing the influence of cultural
   characteristics such as collectivism and gender ideology on work-family
   conflict. Results indicated that immigrant Latinos in poultry processing
   experienced infrequent work-to-family conflict; both the level and the
   antecedents of work-to-family conflict differed by gender, with physical
   demands contributing to greater conflict for women but not men. In
   addition, there was little evidence that work-family conflict was
   associated with health in this population. These results demonstrate how
   traditional models of work-family conflict need to be modified to
   reflect the needs and circumstances of diverse workers in the new global
   economy.},

Abstract = {We study the problem of cooperative behavior emerging in an environment
   where individual behaviors and interaction structures coevolve. Players
   not only learn which strategy to adopt by imitating the strategy of the
   best-performing player they observe, but also choose with whom they
   should interact by selectively creating and/or severing ties with other
   players based on a myopic cost-benefit comparison. We find that scalable
   cooperation-that is, high levels of cooperation in large populations-can
   be achieved in sparse networks, assuming that individuals are able to
   sever ties unilaterally and that new ties can only be created with the
   mutual consent of both parties. Detailed examination shows that there is
   an important trade-off between local reinforcement and global expansion
   in achieving cooperation in dynamic networks. As a result, networks in
   which ties are costly and local structure is largely absent tend to
   generate higher levels of cooperation than those in which ties are made
   easily and friends of friends interact with high probability, where the
   latter result contrasts strongly with the usual intuition.},

Abstract = {To expand on the understanding of how affective states are linked within

   member's affect over time, even after controlling for team performance.
   In addition, they found that these affective linkages were moderated by
   individual differences in susceptibility to emotional contagion and

   stronger for those high in susceptibility and those with collectivistic

Abstract = {This field study investigated contextual antecedents of free riding by
   franchisees on franchisor brand reputation and effects of free riding on
   performance in a multinational corporation's franchising network.
   Structural elements (increased formalization, decentralized
   decision-making), interactions between franchisor representatives and
   franchisee dealers, and market-related factors (external competition)
   were associated with lower levels of franchisee free riding. The
   findings also indicated that free riding has deleterious effects on
   franchisee performance. The results support theoretical arguments that
   both economic and social exchange perspectives are valuable in examining
   free riding and provide important practical guidance in designing and
   managing franchise systems. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {This paper develops a theoretical framework that situates institutional
   entrepreneurship by drawing from Gramsci's concept of hegemony to
   understand the contingent stabilization of organizational fields, and by
   employing his discussion of the Modern Prince as the collective agent
   who organizes and strategizes counter-hegemonic challenges. Our
   framework makes three contributions. First, we characterize the
   interlaced material, discursive, and organizational dimensions of field
   structure. Second, we argue that strategy must be examined more
   rigorously as the mode of action by which institutional entrepreneurs
   engage with field structures. Third, we argue that institutional
   entrepreneurship, in challenging the position of incumbent actors and
   stable fields, reveals a `strategic face of power', particularly useful
   for understanding the political nature of contestation in issue-based
   fields.},

Abstract = {This study analyzes the effects of group membership change on group
   cognition and performance to determine how groups can simultaneously
   leverage oldtimers' collective knowledge and a newcomer's expertise. Our
   analysis focuses specifically on the interrelated effects of the two
   components of a transactive memory system (TMS)-TMS structure and TMS
   processes-to explain the cognitive mechanisms through which membership
   change affects group performance. Results from a laboratory study show
   that groups that experience partial membership change tend to rely on
   the TMS structure that oldtimers developed in their original group, and
   that doing so is ultimately detrimental to performance because it
   creates inefficient TMS processes. Results from a supplemental study
   indicate that these TMS process inefficiencies can be avoided when
   oldtimers are instructed to reflect upon their collective knowledge
   prior to task execution. We discuss the implications for managing group
   cognition in organizations where membership change is prevalent. (c)

Journal = {REVIEW OF ECONOMIC STUDIES},
Year = {2007},
Volume = {74},
Number = {3},
Pages = {857-895},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {In this paper, a formal test of intra-household commitment is derived
   and performed. To that end, two models of household intertemporal
   behaviour are developed. In both models, household members are
   characterized by individual preferences. In the first formulation,
   household decisions are always on the ex ante Pareto frontier. In the
   second model, the assumption of intra-household commitment required by
   ex ante efficiency is relaxed. It is shown that the full-efficiency
   household Euler equations are nested in the no-commitment Euler
   equations. Using this result, the hypothesis that household members can
   commit to future allocations of resources is tested using the Consumer
   Expenditure Survey. I strongly reject this hypothesis. It is also shown
   that the standard unitary framework is a special case of the
   full-efficiency model. However, if household members are not able to
   commit, household intertemporal behaviour cannot be characterized using
   the standard life-cycle model. These findings have two main
   implications. First, policy makers can change household behaviour by
   modifying the decision power of individual household members. Second, to
   evaluate programmes designed to improve the welfare of household
   members, it would be beneficial to replace the standard unitary model
   with a characterization of household behaviour that allows for lack of
   commitment.},

Abstract = {We argue that the collective assumptions of firms drive their actions
   and practices, and create the conditions of industry velocity. In our
   view, cognitive construction by firms is the primary driver of industry
   velocity. This is in contrast to the contingency views common in the
   literature, which hold that industry velocity plays a role by
   constraining and shaping firm strategies. Specifically, we suggest that
   firms develop unique assumptions, social networks, and feedback
   mechanisms; that these mechanisms perpetuate patterns of changes in
   collective beliefs and aggregate actions; and that these patterns in
   turn shape high- and low-velocity conditions. We examine these
   assertions by tracing the collective beliefs of three aircraft
   (low-velocity) and semiconductor (high-velocity) firms over a 20-year
   period (1977-1997). Our results suggest that the cognitive construction
   view of industry velocity is reasonable.},

Abstract = {Studies on institutional change generally pertain to the

   to spearhead change despite constraints. In many complex fields,
   however, change also needs cooperation from numerous dispersed actors

   ensuring that these actors engage in collective action when individual
   interests favor lack of cooperation. We draw on complementary insights
   from institutional and regime theories to identify drivers of collective

   is applied to the field of global climate policy to illustrate how

Title = {The new deal at the top},
Journal = {HARVARD BUSINESS REVIEW},
Year = {2007},
Volume = {85},
Number = {6},
Pages = {98+},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {What makes a company strategically agile - able to alter its strategies
   and business models rapidly in response to major changes in its market
   space, and to do so repeatedly without major trauma? Three years of
   in-depth case research on a dozen large companies worldwide showed the
   authors that one key factor is a new leadership model at the top.
   Senior executives at agile companies assume collective rather than
   individual responsibility for results. They build interdependencies
   among units and divisions, motivating themselves to engage with one
   another, and carefully manage their dealings to promote collaboration
   that is frequent, intense, informal, open, and focused on shared issues
   and the long term. Challenges to conventional thinking are encouraged.
   This is the new deal, and it's not easy to strike, because it requires
   executives to act in ways that are far from comfortable. After all, the
   corporate ladder at most firms favors independent types with a deep need
   for power and autonomy. At executive meetings, disagreement is
   suppressed or expressed passive-aggressively, eroding any real sense of
   belonging to a team. Switching to the new deal almost always requires a
   huge shift in the company's culture, values, and norms of interaction.
   The authors describe three approaches to making the shift: Executives
   can be given formal responsibility not for a business unit but for
   different stages in the company's value chain. This worked well for SAP,
   which has a relatively focused business portfolio. When a company's

Abstract = {Coordination is important in software development because it leads to
   benefits such as cost savings, shorter development cycles, and
   better-integrated products. Team cognition research suggests that
   members coordinate through team knowledge, but this perspective has only
   been investigated in real-time collocated tasks and we know little about
   which types of team knowledge best help coordination in the most
   geographically distributed software work. In this field study, we
   investigate the coordination needs of software teams, how team knowledge
   affects coordination, and how this effect is influenced by geographic
   dispersion. Our findings show that software teams have three distinct
   types of coordination needs-technical, temporal, and process-and that
   these needs vary with the members' role; geographic distance has a
   negative effect on coordination, but is mitigated by shared knowledge of
   the team and presence awareness; and shared task knowledge is more
   important for coordination among collocated members. We articulate
   propositions for future research in this area based on our analysis.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ETHICS},

Volume = {72},
Number = {4},
Pages = {359-374},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {In the economic literature on the firm, especially in the
   transaction-cost tradition, a sharp distinction is drawn between
   so-called ``market transactions{''} and ``administered transactions.{''}
   This distinction is of enormous importance for business ethics, since
   market transactions are governed by the competitive logic of the market,
   whereas administered transactions are subject to the cooperative norms
   that govern collective action in a bureaucracy. The widespread failure
   to distinguish between these two types of transactions, and thus to
   distinguish between adversarial and non-adversarial relations, has led
   many business ethicists to develop a ``uniform{''} moral code. Yet in
   market transactions, the checks and balances built into the system of
   commercial exchange are such as to permit more instrumental forms of
   behavior. In administered transactions, by contrast, these checks and
   balances are absent, and thus the institutional context calls for much
   greater exercise of moral restraint. In this paper, I begin the task of
   developing an adversarial ethic for business. According to this view,
   the competitive environment licenses a greater range of
   ``self-interested{''} behavior, but also imposes its own constraints on
   the strategies that firms may adopt in the pursuit of their interests.},

   Collectivists judged paired products as less similar than individualists
   did, but only at the higher level of a category hierarchy (studies 1 and
   2). Further, collectivists were more context driven in product ratings
   in a categorization task (study 3). Study 4 focused on high-level pairs
   and found that under high involvement, chronic self-construal dominated
   judgments. Under low involvement, chronic and situational construals
   interacted: individualists (collectivists) were less (more) amenable to
   the situational construal. Implications for self-construal and

Abstract = {Expatriate managers of international businesses in emerging countries
   often struggle to mobilize their workforces. They sometimes perceive
   profound cultural differences as a barrier to the progress of their
   organizations. Some international businesses may adopt a paternalistic
   attitude toward their employees; but this questionable strategy brings
   mixed results. Are there ways out of paternalism for international
   businesses in emerging areas? This paper examines the diverging views
   held by foreign managers and local personnel of a foreign-owned
   production plant in Mexico, which managed to mobilize its workforce by
   building a strong sense of community, allowing a certain form of
   collective control to replace the paternalistic model, with its bonds of
   personal allegiance. Contrasting perspectives between Mexican and
   foreign employees show that intercultural misunderstandings, rather than
   the peculiarities of the local culture, are the greatest challenge to
   cooperation.},

Abstract = {We conduct an ethnographic case study of poor migrant women living in a

   important context. Poor migrants have no choice but to engage Turkish
   consumer culture because it is hegemonic and it conflicts ideologically
   with their village culture, and they do so with few resources. Our
   dominated consumer acculturation model specifies three modes of
   acculturation structured by this context: migrants reconstitute their
   village culture in the city, shutting out the dominant ideology; or they
   collectively pursue the dominant ideology as a myth through ritualized
   consumption; or they give up on both pursuits, resulting in a shattered
   identity project.},

Abstract = {This study sought to unify the team composition literature by using
   meta-analytic techniques to estimate the relationships between specified

   composition variable and team performance relationships was moderated by
   the study setting (lab or field) and the operationalization of the team
   composition variable. In lab settings, team minimum and maximum general
   mental ability and team mean emotional intelligence were related to team
   performance. Only negligible effects were observed in lab settings for
   the personality factor and team performance relationships, as well as
   the value and team performance relationships. In contrast, team minimum
   agreeableness and team mean conscientiousness, openness to experience,
   collectivism, and preference for teamwork emerged as strong predictors
   of team performance in field studies. Results can be used to effectively
   compose teams in organizations and guide future team composition

Abstract = {Although estimations typically possess correct answers, these answers
   may be difficult to demonstrate to others. However, providing external
   information may increase their demonstrability. In this experiment,
   individuals (N = 60) and 6-person groups (N = 360) generated estimations
   with or without frames of reference. We hypothesized that estimations
   involving frames of reference would be best fit by models predicting
   intra-group influence based on the accuracy of alternatives or of
   members in general. Conversely, we hypothesized that estimations not
   involving frames of reference would be best fit by models predicting
   influence based on member extroversion or proposal centrality. Results
   indicate that groups outperformed individuals and that estimations
   generated in the presence of frames of reference were superior to those
   generated in their absence. Accuracy and expertise schemes provided the
   best fit when frames of reference were provided, whereas an extroversion
   scheme provided the best fit when they were not. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

Abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to build theory on peak performance at the
   group level. Peak performance transcends ordinary performance and is
   associated with a subjective experience in which one loses a sense of
   time and space as well as feels great joy and bliss. We chose to study
   this phenomenon at the group level through a methodology of participant
   observation in an orchestra. We found that groups can be transformed by
   their own performance in a reflexive process in which virtuosity, or
   individual peak performance, becomes collective. We offer a
   propositional model of collective virtuosity in organizations, and offer

Abstract = {In this article, we address the question of how organizational practices
   are diffused within networks of practice. We do so by drawing on the
   results of an ethnographic study of the diffusion of a complex mental
   health care treatment modality - the Democratic Therapeutic Community -
   that involved the attempted spread of novel work practices within a
   professional network of psychiatrists and their associated
   multi-disciplinary teams at two new clinical sites. We orientate the
   study within the networks of practice (NOP) literature on the diffusion
   of new work practices, considering in particular the issue of
   organizational power, which has been neglected hitherto. After
   presenting our ethnographic material, we draw attention to the role of
   clinical ideology, derived from founders and upheld by new, local
   clinical leaders in the appropriation process. By bringing in a concern
   for organizational power, we add to the existing literature through
   stressing the importance of ideological power, in supplying collective
   meaning, and the influential role of founders as creators and
   `institutionalizers' of underlying ideologies.},

Title = {Poweract and organizational work: Gerard Mendel's socio-psychoanalysis},
Journal = {ORGANIZATION STUDIES},
Year = {2007},
Volume = {28},
Number = {3},
Pages = {409-428},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {One of the principal merits of Gerard Mendel's socio-psychoanalysis lies
   in the fact that it strives to understand how organizational reality
   influences individual psychic reality, including in its unconscious
   dimension. A collective practice, it aims to study how actors, in the
   framework of their daily professional activity, and organized into
   specific groups (homogeneous in terms of profession), reflect by
   themselves on the forces that impact their personality. The working
   hypothesis of socio-psychoanalysis is that the hold of organizations on
   individuals is such that the latter have very little power over their
   acts of work; whence the negative psychological effects with their
   harmful socio-economic consequences. For Mendel, it seems necessary to
   intervene right from the beginning of the socio-psychoanalytic process
   in the dimension of the organization of work. The intervention
   methodology adopted is that of an institutional system whose function is
   to counter, as much as possible, the pathogenic effects of the
   organization of work by neutralizing the hierarchical, technical, social
   and organizational divisions that run through it, in order to trigger a
   `movement of appropriation of the act' (poweract). Thus, when the
   conditions are in place for individuals to exercise real power over
   their productive acts, then pleasure, creativity, motivation,
   participation and a sense of responsibility may all develop in them. In
   so doing, the system endeavours not only to act on the concrete reality
   of work, but also to enable certain psychosocial changes in the
   personality.},

Volume = {24},

Note = {20th Contemporary Accounting Research Conference, Montreal, CANADA, 2005},
Abstract = {Longer-term alliances between corporate buyers and sellers are now
   commonplace. Extant research predominantly models these
   interorganizational. relationships as dyads. This field study seeks to
   extend the current research in two ways. First, it analyzes a supply
   alliance as nested within a larger network of interorganizational
   relationships. The paper demonstrates that network ties with
   ``significant others{''} influence the operation of accounting controls
   in the focal supply alliance. That is, ties with third and fourth
   parties materially affect the management control of an alliance. Second,
   it shows that, like other social collectives such as firms and
   societies, networks are embedded in implicit normative and interpretive
   frameworks that influence and are influenced by accounting controls.
   Evidence is provided as to how tacit beliefs about ``fair{''} pricing
   and ``appropriate{''} supplier behavior affect the performance
   management of the focal supply alliance, thus making it difficult to
   draw the distinction between accounting as a ``technical{''} control as
   opposed to a form of ``social{''} control.},

Volume = {71},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Arriving at a moral judgment is not a straightforward or linear process
   in which ethical theories are simply applied to cases. Instead it is a
   process in which the formulation of the moral problem, the formulation
   of possible ``solutions{''}, and the ethical judging of these solutions
   go hand in hand. This messy character of moral problems, however, does
   not rule out a systematic approach. In this article, we describe a
   systematic approach to problem solving that does justice to the complex
   nature of moral problems and ethical judgment: the ethical cycle. Our
   goal is to provide a structured and disciplined method of addressing
   moral problems, which helps to guide a sound analysis of these problems.
   We will illustrate the usefulness of this cycle with an example.
   Further, we will discuss two general issues in applied ethics in
   relation to the proposed ethical cycle: the role of ethical theories and
   the place of individual judgment versus collective deliberation.},

Abstract = {This article analyses how participants in a not-for-profit service
   organization (the `Incubator'(I)) drew on understandings of `ethics' in
   order to make sense of their individual and collective selves.
   Identities are theorized as being constituted within discursive regimes,
   and notions of ethics are conceived as discursive resources on which
   individuals and groups may draw in their attempts to author versions of
   their self and organizational narratives. We show how conceptions of
   ethics were a rich vein on which organizational members drew to
   elaborate narratives that legitimated particular modes of working and
   which cohered an otherwise quite disparate community of individuals. The
   research contribution of this article is twofold. First, we discuss how
   a discourse focused on ethics may be a strategic resource for identity
   work. Second, we analyse how talk and writing about issues of ethics are
   implicated in relations of power and ongoing struggles for control over
   organizations conceived as discursive spaces. In so doing, this article
   advances our understanding of ethics as discursively complex
   constructions, which require the micro-analysis of language practices in
   situated contexts for action.},

Year = {2007},

Abstract = {While marketing activities increasingly involve personalizing product
   offers to individually elicited preferences, these unique specifications
   may not be universally important for product choice. Providing evidence
   of the limits of treating each customer differently, three experiments
   show that individuals who exhibit interdependent or collectivistic
   tendencies tend to be more receptive to recommendations that are not
   personalized to their own preferences, but instead to the collective
   preferences of relevant in-groups. However, we find that cultural
   orientation affects responses to personalized recommendations for only
   those products whose consumption or choice decision is subject to public
   scrutiny. We further demonstrate that the favorability of thoughts
   elicited by ads offering targeted versus personalized offers mediates
   the effect of cultural orientation on responses to personalization.
   Finally, both individualistic and collectivistic consumers respond more
   favorably to offers of targeted recommendations when they believe
   relevant others share their preferences and when their level of
   expertise is relatively low.},

Abstract = {T his research attempts to understand and test a core assumption in
   neoinstitutional theory, i.e., that institutional logics shape
   individual attitudes and preferences, by studying cross-national
   differences in people's attitudes toward the continuous learning model
   of employee training-an increasingly popular model of training. I
   propose that national institutional logics regarding the individual's
   role (empowered versus limited) can shape people's preferences for the
   new model of training. By using a historically grounded typology of
   national politics depicting the organization of authority (statism) and
   society (corporateness), I suggest how these two dimensions carry
   distinct logics about the individual's role and, in turn, shape people's
   training orientation. Training attitudes of people in 16 European (EU)
   countries/regions are examined using data from the 1995 Eurobarometer
   Training Survey. Results from hierarchical models show that, beyond the
   influence of individual characteristics, people from nonstatist (i.e.,
   collective authority is located in civil society rather than in the
   state) and noncorporatist (i.e., individuals are incorporated into the
   society as autonomous actors rather than members in collectives)
   countries are more likely to prefer the continuous learning model of
   training, By explicitly linking institutional logics with individual
   attitudes, this study contributes to the neoinstitutional perspective,
   studies on training attitudes, and cross-national research.},

Journal = {HUMAN RELATIONS},
Year = {2007},
Volume = {60},
Number = {3},
Pages = {403-434},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Findings from two field studies support the proposition that the way
   individuals define their role, or their role orientation, is a powerful
   influence on their behaviour, resulting in more or less effective job
   performance. The first study showed that, within a relatively
   self-managing context, flexible role orientation predicted supervisory
   assessments of overall job performance, as well as a change in job
   performance. The second study showed flexible role orientation predicted
   job performance in high autonomy jobs but not low autonomy jobs. In both
   studies, role orientation predicted performance more strongly than other
   work attitudes, including job satisfaction, generalized self-efficacy,
   locus of control, and job aspiration. Collectively, the findings suggest
   that the development of a more flexible role orientation represents a
   relatively unexplored avenue for enhancing employee performance,
   particularly in self-managing contexts. As such, further research on the
   process of shaping and promoting employees' role orientation is
   recommended.},

Title = {Contributing to public document repositories: A critical mass theory
   perspective},
Journal = {ORGANIZATION STUDIES},
Year = {2007},
Volume = {28},
Number = {3},
Pages = {327-346},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Public document repositories (PDRs) are valuable resources available on
   the Internet and are a component of the broader information commons
   freely accessible to the public., Instances of PDRs include the
   repository of reviews at Amazon.com and the online encyclopedia at
   Wikipedia. These repositories are created and sustained by the voluntary
   contributions of individuals who are not compensated for their inputs.
   This paper draws on and extends critical mass theory in the context of
   PDRs. Using data on the reviews written by prolific reviewers at
   Amazon.com and the text of their personal profiles, we find the critical
   mass of contributors at the PDR not only to be prolific and contributing
   high-quality reviews, but also to be among the earliest contributors of
   reviews on products. Reviewer profiles revealed the presence of multiple
   self-oriented motives (self expression, personal development,
   utilitarian motives, and enjoyment) and other-oriented motives (social
   affiliation, altruism, and reciprocity) for contribution. We find that
   the quality and quantity of contributions are inversely related and the
   motives for quantity of contribution are different from those related to
   the quality of contribution. The study highlights that PDRs are viewed
   by contributors as social contexts even though making contributions is
   an individual act that does not involve social interaction.},

   addition, we examine the moderating influence of three individual

   interaction propensity. We empirically test our framework using
   self-reported and objective data from 203 members of a firm-hosted
   technical support community. In addition to several interesting
   moderating effects, we find that a customer's online interaction

Journal = {ADMINISTRATIVE SCIENCE QUARTERLY},
Year = {2007},
Volume = {52},
Number = {1},
Pages = {1-31},

Abstract = {In this paper, we bring structural holes theory to different cultural
   contexts by studying the effect of structural holes in four high- tech
   companies in China and assessing whether they confer the benefits to
   individuals occupying the brokering position in a career network that
   have been found in Western contexts. On the level of national culture,
   we propose that the typical collectivistic culture of China will dampen
   the effects of structural holes. On the organizational level, we propose
   that in organizations that foster a high- commitment culture - a culture
   that emphasizes mutual investment between people - the control benefits
   of structural holes are dissonant with the dominant spirit of
   cooperation, and the information benefits of structural holes cannot
   materialize due to the communal-sharing values in such organizations.
   Empirical results of network surveys confirm our hypotheses, and
   interview data add depth to our explanations. Brokers do not fit with
   the collectivistic values of China. Further, the more an organization
   possesses a clan- like, high- commitment culture, the more detrimental
   are structural holes for employees' career achievements such as salary
   or bonus, even after controlling for a host of other factors that may
   influence these career outcomes. In high commitment organizations, the
   `` integrators{''} who bring people together to fill structural holes
   enjoy greater career benefits.},

Abstract = {The idea of tacit knowledge plays an important role in many areas of
   academic debate, not least automation and its role in management. Here
   it is shown that tacit knowledge comes in two distinct types, with
   different causes and consequences. The first kind,,somatic-limit tacit
   knowledge', has to do with the limitations of the human body and brain
   and has no consequences for encoding knowledge into machines. The second
   kind, `collective tacit knowledge', is more `ontological' than
   biological, having to do with its location in the social collectivity.
   Here the human body and brain's unique capacity gives it special access
   to the tacit knowledge; known and foreseeable machines do not have this
   capacity.},

Title = {`Helping the family': The mediating role of outside directors in ethnic
   Chinese family firms},
Journal = {HUMAN RELATIONS},
Year = {2007},
Volume = {60},
Number = {2},
Pages = {285-314},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {This article explores the nature and process of non-executive director
   (NED or non-executive) influence in quoted, family-controlled firms
   (FCFs) through two company case studies in Singapore. Existing views of
   the non-executive role in such firms have been derived from theory, with
   traditional and `new' agency approaches and resource dependence theory
   each offering differing prescriptions of the role. The article reviews
   this literature and suggests the potential value of qualitative research
   for understanding and reconciling competing prescriptions of the NED
   role. It then presents two case studies which explore the processes
   whereby independent non-executives seek to influence decision-making
   during critical incidents in the life of two FCFs. Based on these cases
   the article critiques the zero-sum view of power and the `nuclear'
   conception of the family that informs much of the suspicious and hostile
   perspective of family control held by some agency scholars. In contrast,
   the article argues for a relational conception of power through which
   NEDs, despite the reality of family power and control, achieve effective
   influence through playing a vital mediating role in a web of firm and
   family relationships. This involves NEDs in defending the collective
   interest in the continuity of an `extended' family of the firm against
   the damaging intrusion of `family altruism' and managerial opportunism.
   Such a role can augment the authority of non-executives and the board
   whilst allowing necessary changes to be implemented.},

Title = {Raising Haier},
Journal = {HARVARD BUSINESS REVIEW},
Year = {2007},
Volume = {85},
Number = {2},
Pages = {141+},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Zhang Ruimin's leadership of the renowned Haier Group began before the
   Chinese company even carried that name. More than 20 years ago, Zhang
   was appointed director of the Qingdao Refrigerator Factory, which faced
   enormous debt and didn't seem likely to survive, let alone prosper. The
   main challenge in those early days was boosting the morale of his
   workers, who had gone unpaid for months and grown deeply dispirited.
   Zhang borrowed money so he could catch up on payroll and make other
   improvements -and his employees took heart.
   Once he had won their goodwill, Zhang explains in this first-person
   account, he started demanding good work. There was very little
   discipline in the factory up to that point. Rules and regulations
   existed in writing but had never been seriously upheld. Zhang guaranteed
   the payment of salaries, but only on the condition that people obeyed
   the policies he established-some as simple as ``Stealing company
   property is prohibited.{''} Those who violated factory rules could be
   given demerits or even deprived of factory membership (that is, no
   longer allowed to be part of the company's collective ownership). Far
   from intimidating employees, this boost in discipline gave people a
   sense of security and hope.
   Now that Haier is a world-class operation competing in global markets,
   Zhang's focus as chief executive has shifted from setting a strong
   example to giving employees room to make their own decisions and realize
   their goals. To that end, he is striving to create an organizational
   structure that is as flat and has as few boundaries as possible. He is
   also emphasizing what will serve the market, not what will please
   someone further up in the company hierarchy. Employees, he believes,
   should feel that they have a customer to answer to, more so than a
   superior.},

Title = {What leads organizational members to collectivize? Injustice and
   identification as precursors of union certification},
Journal = {ORGANIZATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2007},
Volume = {18},
Number = {1},
Pages = {108-126},
Month = {JAN-FEB},
Abstract = {This paper presents the results of two studies that examine the impact
   of both social psychological and economic concerns on organizational
   members' decisions to support or oppose union formation. The studies
   test the predictions that procedural justice judgments and social
   identification-two social psychological factors that shape the nature of
   how people relate to their organizations-have a significant influence on
   people's support for union certification and on the votes they cast in a
   union certification election. Importantly, it was predicted that these
   effects would emerge even after accounting for the influence of people's
   economic concerns, which have been the primary focus of previous efforts
   to understand whether people support union formation. The results
   confirm these predictions and demonstrate that respondents' positions on
   the unionization issue are shaped by procedural justice (Studies 1 and
   2) and social identity (Study 2) even after accounting for economic
   factors. Furthermore, Study 2 shows that the impact of procedural
   justice judgments on union certification was partially mediated by
   social identity. More generally, the results highlight the importance of
   integrating both social psychological and economic concerns in models
   designed to explain organizational phenomena such as the formation of
   unions.},

Journal = {ACCOUNTING ORGANIZATIONS AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2007},
Volume = {32},
Number = {1-2},
Pages = {101-129},

Abstract = {Accounting research has increasingly been concerned to investigate
   professional expertise. This paper contributes to this interest by
   examining the process by which state (or government) auditors may become
   recognized as possessing expertise relevant to guiding and implementing
   new public management reforms. We analyze this process in the Canadian
   province of Alberta to understand the construction of a claim to
   expertise, drawing on theories in the social study of science and
   technology. Specifically, through our study of the development and
   consolidation of a network of support, we examine how the Office of the
   Auditor General of Alberta anchored its claims to expertise in the
   corpus of knowledge on measurement of government performance; the
   various devices that the Office used to sustain these claims; and the
   ways in which government and public servants reacted to them. In
   particular, our paper provides insights into how standards of ``good
   practices{''} develop through a process of ``fact{''} building, which
   involves the undertaking of local experiments by practitioners, the,
   production of inscriptions in reports, and their subsequent validation
   by other practitioners. The production of inscriptions in sites of
   occupational practice such as those operated by government audit
   offices, and the collective process of validation that subsequently
   takes place in the practitioner community, are significant aspects in
   the construction of networks of support around claims to expertise. (c)

Abstract = {Consider a Bayesian collective decision problem in which the preferences

   that the utility costs associated with incentive constraints become
   negligible when the decision problem is linked with a large number of
   independent copies of itself. This is established by defining a
   mechanism in which agents must budget their representations of
   preferences so that the frequency of preferences across problems mirrors
   the underlying distribution of preferences, and then arguing that
   agents' incentives are to satisfy their budget by being as truthful as
   possible. We also show that all equilibria of the linking mechanisms
   converge to the target utility levels. The mechanisms do not require
   transferable utility or interpersonal comparisons of utility, and are
   immune to manipulations by coalitions.},

   the importance of both actions and interactions of corporate centre and

   shows that acting and knowing of these teams is dynamic, collective and
   distributed within the multi-business firm across two interrelated
   levels: within the team and across teams, each involving both recursive
   and adaptive activities. Our article is divided into three parts. The
   first outlines the theoretical and methodological issues for studying
   the practice of strategy teams in multi-business firms. In the second,
   our empirical findings are reported. Finally, the third part presents

Abstract = {In organizational groups, often a majority has aligned preferences that
   oppose those of a minority. Although such situations may give rise to
   majority coalitions that exclude the minority or to minorities blocking
   unfavorable agreements, structural and motivational factors may
   stimulate groups to engage in integrative negotiation, leading to
   collectively beneficial agreements. An experiment with 97 3-person
   groups was designed to test hypotheses about the interactions among
   decision rule, the majority's social motivation, and the minority's
   social motivation. Results showed that under unanimity rule, minority
   members block decisions, thus harming the group, but only when the
   minority has proself motivation. Under majority rule, majority members
   coalesce at the minority's expense, but only when the majority has a
   proself motivation. Implications for negotiation research and group
   decision making are discussed.},

Year = {2007},
Volume = {31},

Abstract = {New venture success often depends on how the founding team collectively
   understands its world, estimates effects of possible actions, makes
   decisions, and allocates appropriate resources. Drawing on recent work
   in managerial cognition and entrepreneurship, this article argues for
   the importance of examining cognition at the team level. New venture
   strategy is used as a springboard to discuss collective cognition,
   although other important critical decision domains in new ventures may
   also be used to illustrate the arguments. In this and other such
   decision domains, collective cognition mediates between individual
   cognitions and firm actions and performance. A method for assessing
   entrepreneurial top management team cognition is developed and then
   tested in an exploratory study of technology-based new ventures. Two
   structural characteristics of collective cognition ( differentiation and
   integration) are strongly related to firm performance, suggesting
   interesting opportunities for future entrepreneurship research in
   cognition.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT STUDIES},
Year = {2006},
Volume = {43},
Number = {8},
Pages = {1753-1773},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {This paper presents a dynamic framework that describes how firms
   allocate limited resources between improving their competitive position
   relative to rivals and their communal position shared with rivals. This
   dynamic framework outlines how organizational field-level dynamics
   influence industry attractiveness and thereby alter a firm's incentive
   to engage in communal strategy relative to competitive strategy.
   Communal strategy, in turn, can influence the institutions governing an
   organizational field and thereby shape industry attractiveness. Overall,
   the interplay between factors exogenous and endogenous to an industry
   cause change in an organizational field and so determine the nature of
   the communal environment shared by a firm and its rivals over time.
   Analysis of this interplay provides insight into the micro-level drivers
   of macro-level change and furthers understanding of the conditions under
   which rivalrous firms voluntarily contribute to collective betterment of
   their industry despite collective rationality.},

Abstract = {The concept of collective efficacy within virtual teams has yet to be
   studied. This study developed and rigorously validated a domain-specific
   measure of collective efficacy, entitled virtual team efficacy, within a
   comprehensive research framework. Over a two-year period we collected
   field study data from multiple samples of information systems project
   teams-in all, 52 virtual teams comprising 318 students from the United
   States, Great Britain, and Hong Kong. As we hypothesized, group potency
   and computer collective efficacy act as antecedents to virtual team
   efficacy, and virtual team efficacy is in turn predictive of perceptual
   and objective measures of performance. Further, consistent with efficacy
   theory, we also find that virtual team efficacy acts on performance
   outcomes through specific mediating processes. This paper contributes to
   the academic and practitioner communities by providing a comprehensive
   model of virtual team efficacy and performance and by providing
   validated instrumentation that can be immediately applied during further
   research in this area.},

Title = {Ownership concentration in privatized firms: The role of disclosure

Journal = {JOURNAL OF ACCOUNTING RESEARCH},
Year = {2006},
Volume = {44},
Number = {5},
Pages = {889-929},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {We rely on a unique data set to estimate the impact of disclosure
   standards and auditor-related characteristics on ownership concentration
   in 190 privatized firms from 31 countries. Accounting transparency can
   help alleviate the agency conflict between minority investors and
   controlling shareholders, which is evident in the extent of ownership
   concentration, since the expropriation of corporate resources hinges on
   these private benefits remaining hidden. After controlling for other
   country-level and firm-level determinants, we find weak (no) evidence
   that extensive disclosure standards (auditor choice) reduce ownership
   concentration. In contrast, we report strong, robust evidence that
   ownership concentration is lower in countries with securities laws that
   specify a lower burden of proof in civil and criminal litigation against
   auditors, consistent with Ball's {[}2001] predictions. Collectively, our
   research implies that minority investors worldwide value legal
   institutions that discipline auditors in the event of financial
   reporting failure over both the presence of a Big 5 auditor and better
   disclosure standards. Re-estimating our regressions on a broad sample of
   western European public firms provides similar evidence on all of our
   predictions.},

Abstract = {In studying the relationship between individualism-collectivism and team
   performance, empirical research has shown that individualistic team
   members exert a negative influence on team performance. However,
   theoretical understanding of why this relationship exists is lacking.
   Addressing this gap in the literature, this research proposes a
   theoretical model of the relationship between individualism-collectivism
   and team performance by integrating two previously distinct theories,
   social identity theory and the social relations model. Drawing upon
   these theories, we propose that team identification, meta-perception
   accuracy, and team identity will mediate the relationship between
   individualism-collectivism and team performance. Further, we posit that
   task interdependence will moderate the relationship between
   individualism-collectivism and team identification. In developing our
   work, we formulate testable propositions which are aligned with the
   specific relationships shown in our model. After presenting our model
   and propositions, we discuss the theoretical and practical implications
   of our work, and suggest areas for future research.},

Abstract = {In this paper we model the pathways commonly traversed as user
   innovations are transformed into commercial products. First, one or more
   users recognize a new set of design possibilities and begin to innovate.
   They then join into communities, motivated by the increased efficiency
   of collective innovation. User-manufacturers then emerge, using
   high-variable/low-capital cost production methods. Finally, as user
   innovation slows, the market stabilizes enough for high-capital,
   low-variable cost manufacturing to enter. We test the model against the
   history of the rodeo kayak industry and find it supported. We discuss
   implications for ``dominant design{''} theory and for innovation
   practice. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The paper argues that accounting historians can help us to understand
   the origins of the British Industrial Revolution (BIR) by explaining the
   contribution of accounting to financial success. It re-examines the
   archive of the Carron Company (hereafter, `Carron') from its formation
   in 1759 to around 1850 to explore the theory derived from Marx that
   class conflict, the capitalist mentality, its social relations of
   production, and accounts, drove the BIR. It shows that, contrary to the
   currently accepted view that Carron's early financial accounts were a
   `shambles', its partners used integrated financial and management
   accounts based on double entry bookkeeping to impose capitalist
   accountability on their managers and workers. The paper argues that
   zealous accounting was critical to Carron's financial success because
   accountability for capital drove orgamisational and technical innovation
   and it underlay the partners' early social solidarity. Carron's partners
   worked collectively during the company's difficult formative period up
   to the 1780s, using accounts to hold the managing partner and his
   subordinates accountable to them for the circulation of capital and to
   conduct class war against their workers. From the 1790s, the managing
   partner exploited a weakness in Carron's system of corporate governance
   to understate its profits to demoralise other partners into selling
   their shares to give him control, which he used to divert a
   disproportionate share of its accumulating wealth to him and his family.
   The paper concludes that Carron's history supports the Marxist theory
   that accounts played an important role in fuelling the BIR by giving
   capitalists a technology for controlling production for profit, what
   Marx called controlling the `valorization process', and for promoting
   the social cohesion of capital. It calls on accounting historians to
   test this theory by revisiting the archives of other leading BIR firms,
   so that we can construct a history of this pivotal shift in the
   trajectory of world economic development on solid empirical foundations.

Abstract = {This article draws upon Karl Weick's insights into the nature of
   theorizing, and extends and refines his conception of theory
   construction as `disciplined imagination'. An essential ingredient in
   Weick's `disciplined imagination' involves his assertion that thought
   trials and theoretical representations typically involve a transfer from
   one epistemic sphere to another through the creative use of metaphor.
   The article follows up on this point and draws out how metaphor works,
   how processes of metaphorical imagination partake in theory
   construction, and how insightful metaphors and the theoretical
   representations that result from them can be selected. The paper also
   includes a discussion of metaphors-in-use (organizational improvisation
   as jazz and organizational behaviour as collective mind) which Weick
   proposed in his own writings. The whole purpose of this exercise is to
   theoretically augment and ground the concept of `disciplined
   imagination', and in particular to refine the nature of thought trials
   and selection within it. In doing so, I also aim to provide pointers for
   the use of metaphorical imagination in the process of theory
   construction.},

Abstract = {We study a class of multi-level collective actions, in which each
   individual is simultaneously engaged in an intragroup conflict and
   intergroup competition. The intragroup conflict is modeled as an
   n-person Prisoner's Dilemma game, in which the dominant strategy is to
   contribute nothing. The intergroup competition is for an exogenous and
   commonly known prize shared by members of the winning group. We focus on
   the effects on the level of contribution of the two most common sharing
   rules for dividing the prize, equal and proportional. Our results show
   that (1) embedding the intragroup conflict in intergroup competition
   markedly reduces free riding; (2) the proportional profit sharing rule
   significantly outperforms the egalitarian rule, and the difference
   between the two increases with experience; (3) under egalitarian but not
   under proportional sharing, there is over-contribution compared to
   theoretical predictions, and (4) a simple reinforcement-based learning
   model accounts for the aggregate results of all five experimental
   conditions. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Year = {2006},
Volume = {17},

Abstract = {An emerging body of institutional scholarship emphasizes the role played
   by private decentralized institutions in facilitating colletctive action
   among organizations. However, these institutions often suffer from free
   riding and opportunism. This may lead firms to exit the institution and
   eventually cause its collapse. In this paper, we explore how private
   decentralized institutions may be sustained despite these problems. We
   focus on one form of private decentralized institution-trade
   association-sponsored industry self-regulatory programs. We advance two
   alternative hypotheses to explain the sustained existence of industry
   self-regulatory institutions: (a) Firms participate to gain a
   participation-contingent benefit, and (b) firms participate to maintain
   a generally beneficial institution. Using a 10-year panel of data from
   the chemical industry, we find evidence consistent with the latter
   hypothesis for at least one prominent example of self-regulation. Our
   findings have implications for both specific models of industry
   self-regulation and general theories of collective action.},

   Meglino and Korsgaard's model focuses on the distinction between
   rational self-interest and other orientation, whereas the approach taken
   by De Dreu focuses on the distinction between rational self-interest and
   collective rationality. In this response, the authors clarify this
   distinction, address discrepancies between these two approaches,
   consider the effect of goals and rationality on other-orientated
   behavior, and suggest directions for future research.},

Abstract = {When disaster strikes, many corporations respond generously. After the
   2004 tsunami, for instance, U.S. firms alone contributed more than half
   a billion dollars in cash and in-kind donations. But a host of reactive
   efforts don't produce the best results-and may even get in the way.
   To make the most of their humanitarian efforts, companies need to
   address two fundamental questions: What kind of aid do we want to
   contribute-philanthropic (money and in-kind don ations) or integrative
   (backroom, operational assistance)? And how do we want to contribute
   it-by working one-on-one with a single agency or by joining a
   consortium? The permutations of those two decisions lead to four
   different approaches, each with its own strengths and challenges.
   Single-company philanthropic partnerships work well when there's a good
   match between what a company wants to contribute and what an agency
   needs, as with Coca-Cola's donations of water to the Red Cross. More
   diffuse, but also potentially more effective, a re the benefits of
   joining a multicompany philanthropic partnership, which enables the
   resources of many firms to be matched to the missions of many agencies.
   More difficult to establish but more fundamental in its impact is a
   single-company integrative partnership, in which a corporation works to
   improve the way an aid agency operates, as the logistics giant TNT has
   done to help the distribution efforts of the World Food Programme. And
   most difficult to implement-but potentially most effective-is a
   multicompany integrative partnership, which brings to bear the
   collective best practices of many companies to improve the response
   capabilities of multiple agencies.
   Ifs easy to see why the image of a relief worker carrying a sack of
   grain delivers an emotional wallop, but the behind-the-scenes work of
   process enhancement is just as crucial to humanitarian efforts. The
   sooner executives realize this, the better positioned the world will be
   to respond to global disasters.},

Abstract = {This paper examines the competitive consequences of interfirm mobility.
   Because the loss of key members (defined as top decision makers) to
   competing firms may amount to a replication of a firm's higher-order
   routines, we investigate the conditions under which interfirm mobility
   triggers transfer of routines across organizational boundaries. We
   examine membership lists pertinent to the Dutch accounting industry to
   study key member exits and firm dissolutions over the period 1880-1986.
   We exploit information on the type of membership migration (individual
   versus collective) and the competitive saliency of the destination firm
   as inferred from the recipient status (incumbent versus start-up) and
   its geographic location (same versus. different province). The
   dissolution risk is highest when collective interfirm mobility results
   in a new venture within the same geographic area. The theoretical
   implications of this study are discussed.},

   Moreover, consistent with noise trader models, we find that systematic
   retail trading explains return comovements for stocks with high retail
   concentration (i.e., small-cap, value, lower institutional ownership,
   and lower-priced stocks), especially if these stocks are also costly to
   arbitrage. Macroeconomic news and analyst earnings forecast revisions do
   not explain these results. Collectively, our findings support a role for

Title = {The speed of learning in noisy games: Partial reinforcement and the

Journal = {AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW},
Year = {2006},
Volume = {96},
Number = {4},
Pages = {1029-1042},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {In an experiment, players' ability to learn to cooperate in the repeated
   prisoner's dilemma was substantially diminished when the payoffs were
   noisy, even though players could monitor one another's past actions
   perfectly. In contrast, in one-time play against a succession of
   opponents, noisy payoffs increased cooperation, by slowing the rate at
   which cooperation decays. These observations are consistent with the
   robust observation from the psychology literature that partial
   reinforcement (adding randomness to the link between an action and its
   consequences while holding expected payoffs constant) slows learning.
   This effect is magnified in the repeated game: when others are slow to
   learn to cooperate, the benefits of cooperation are reduced, which
   further hampers cooperation. These results show that a small change in
   the payoff environment, which changes the speed of individual learning,
   can have a large effect on collective behavior. And they show that there
   may be interesting comparative dynamics that can be derived from careful
   attention to the fact that at least some economic behavior is learned
   from experience.},

Title = {Failure to mobilize in reliability-seeking organizations: Two cases from

Journal = {JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT STUDIES},
Year = {2006},
Volume = {43},
Number = {6},
Pages = {1375-1393},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {There is a considerable line of research on organizations dealing with
   large scale, intrinsic hazards. We know a good deal, as a result, about
   both the causation of catastrophic failure and its avoidance. Past work
   has explained failure in terms of (for example) structural
   vulnerabilities and organizational degradation - and reliability in
   terms of collective mindfulness, rigorous enculturation and high levels
   of social redundancy. This paper presents a study, based on a
   qualitative analysis of two disastrous collisions on the UK railway, of
   organizations that are strongly reliability seeking yet ultimately
   experience catastrophic failure. It argues that these cases implicated
   an organizational incapacity to mobilize systemic reform. The
   possibility of the two failures had been well-known in the organizations
   before their occurrence, but this knowledge could not be converted into
   modification. A model is presented to explain how processes of systemic
   reform co-exist with a set of phenomena that tend to undermine them. It
   is these that need to be the principal focus of efforts at managing
   catastrophic failure risks.},

Abstract = {Rose's and Mishler and Rose's `hourglass' construction of post-Soviet
   Russian society illustrates that the civil space traditionally occupied
   by advocacy and community groups continues to be constricted. Such
   groups fail to successfully bridge the space between the individual and
   the state, thereby holding the fledgling Russian democracy to account.
   In this paper, to shed light on reasons for the continuing constriction
   of Russian civil space, the behavior of the environmental movement in
   one Russian region - Samara Oblast - is observed through the lens of
   social capital. By utilizing Adler and Kwon's schema for assessing the
   benefits and risks arising from social capital stocks possessed by
   collectives, it will illustrate that the Russian environmental movement
   is inward looking and parochial; built on pre-existing friendships or
   elite connections; and uninterested in forming a mass movement or
   actively engaging with the Russian public. Moreover, rather than being
   situated within the constricted civil space of Russian society, the
   majority of groups within the Samara environmental movement are
   themselves situated firmly in either half of the hourglass. Groups
   within each half successfully span gaps between each other, but no
   activity is undertaken to bridge or reshape the constricted space
   between the halves.},

Abstract = {The increasing implementation of self-managing teams (SMTs) in service
   delivery suggests the importance of developing confidence beliefs about
   a team's collective competence. This research examined causality in the
   linkage between employee confidence beliefs and performance for
   boundary-spanning SMTs delivering financial services. The authors
   distinguish between task-specific (i.e., team efficacy) and generalized
   (i.e., group potency) employee confidence, as well as between
   customer-based (i.e., customer-perceived service quality) and financial
   (i.e., service revenues) performance. They analyzed employee and
   customer survey data as well as financial performance data from 51 SMTs
   at two points in time using lagged analyses. The findings reveal
   divergent results for team efficacy and group potency, suggesting that
   team efficacy has reciprocal, causal relationships with service revenues
   and customer-perceived service quality. In contrast, group potency has
   no causal relationship with service revenues. Finally,
   customer-perceived service quality predicts group potency, whereas no
   evidence for the reverse effect is provided.},

Abstract = {W e know that organizations of different but related kinds greatly
   influence each other's evolution. Although empirical findings abound,
   the theories behind them are still being developed. We advance a model
   of ecological interdependence between emergent and established
   populations. Our model is based on three main ideas. First, we consider
   related populations to be those that overlap in identity and resource
   space and that simultaneously exhibit competitive and mutualistic
   relationships, the latter leading to legitimacy transfer. Second, we
   build on the idea that legitimated forms codify prescriptive sanctions
   for deviations from identity blueprints, and predict that when an
   emergent population overlaps with an established one in identity space,
   its early proliferation will manifest violations of established social
   identities and will trigger prescriptive sanctions. Third, we rely on
   the notion of a focused identity to argue that organization-level
   changes affect external perceptions of the population's collective
   identity, and hamper legitimacy. Analysis of the survival rates of
   financial cooperatives in Singapore - a population overlapping the
   identity and resources of commercial banks - confirms our predictions.},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {A frequent characterization of open source software is the somewhat
   outdated, mythical one of a collective of supremely talented software
   hackers freely volunteering their services to produce uniformly
   high-quality software. I contend that the open source software
   phenomenon has metamorphosed into a more mainstream and commercially
   viable form, which I label as OSS 2.0. I illustrate this transformation
   using a framework of process and product factors, and discuss how the
   bazaar metaphor, which up to now has been associated with the open
   source development process, has actually shifted to become a metaphor
   better suited to the OSS 2.0 product delivery and support process.
   Overall the OSS 2.0 phenomenon is significantly different from its free
   software antecedent. Its emergence accentuates the fundamental
   alteration of the basic ground rules in the software landscape,
   signifying the end of the proprietary-driven model that has prevailed
   for the past 20 years or so. Thus, a clear understanding of the
   characteristics of the emergent OSS 2.0 phenomenon is required to
   address key challenges for research and practice.},

Title = {Relevance of Baldrige constructs in an international context: A study of
   national culture},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2006},
Volume = {24},
Number = {5},
Pages = {583-603},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Because of the wide acclaim received by the Malcolm Baldrige Award, it
   has served as a model for national quality awards by many countries
   throughout the world. Some countries have adopted both the MBNQA
   criteria and weights, while others have adapted the criteria categories
   or weights somewhat. The relevance of this conceptual framework across
   national cultures has yet to be established, despite its use as the
   foundation for numerous national quality awards. This study uses
   Hofstede's dimensions of national culture to examine whether the
   theoretical constructs underlying the Baldrige criteria are relevant
   across national cultures. Correlation analysis, stepwise regression and
   analysis of variance are used to analyze hypotheses in manufacturing
   plants in the U.S., Japan, Germany, Italy and England. There were many
   interactions between dimensions of national culture and the Baldrige
   constructs advanced in this study. The findings indicate that national
   culture plays a strong role in the effectiveness of the Baldrige
   constructs, with the exception of customer and market focus. The
   findings are interpreted in light of the need for countries to develop
   awards and quality initiatives tailored to their national cultures. (c)

Note = {4th Conference on Organizational Discourse, London, ENGLAND, 2002},
Abstract = {This article builds on constructs that authors have labelled strategic
   ambiguity, interpretative viability, umbrella constructs, and boundary
   objects, and suggests that these constructs all articulate a central
   concern for collective action and the role of ambiguity therein. It
   characterizes as pragmatic ambiguity the condition of admitting more
   than one course of action, and elucidates and operationalizes this new
   construct. Drawing on the sociology of translation (Callon, 1986;
   Latour, 1987),({[}1]) it argues that pragmatic ambiguity is both the
   result and the resource of a collective process of interessement
   occurring during the rise in popularity of a new management approach.
   Following Benders and van Veen (2001), the article posits that pragmatic
   ambiguity increases during the rise of a management fashion. It provides
   empirical evidence in support of this claim by means of a longitudinal
   analysis of quality management (QM) concepts as articulated by several
   authors both before and during the Quality Movement of the 1980s and
   1990s. The analyses of QM texts show that concepts became vaguer, more
   ambiguous, and more general as the Quality Movement gained momentum,
   suggesting the presence of a positive feedback loop between pragmatic
   ambiguity and popularity. In addition, the data illustrate how pragmatic
   ambiguity was achieved and sustained textually, and how it was supported
   by a variety of social, linguistic and rhetorical factors.},

Title = {Selective revealing in open innovation processes: The case of embedded
   Linux},
Journal = {RESEARCH POLICY},
Year = {2006},
Volume = {35},
Number = {7},
Pages = {953-969},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {This paper provides a quantitative study (N = 268) of patterns of free
   revealing of firm-developed innovations within embedded Linux, a type of
   open source software (OSS). I find that firms, without being obliged to
   do so, contribute many of their own developments back to public embedded
   Linux code, eliciting and indeed receiving informal development support
   from other firms. That is, they perform a part of their product
   development open to the public-an unthinkable idea for traditionally
   minded managers. Such openness obviously entails the challenge of
   protecting one's intellectual property. I find that firms address this
   issue by revealing selectively. They reveal, on average, about half of
   the code they have developed, while protecting the other half by various
   means. Revealing is strongly heterogeneous among firms. Multivariate
   analysis can partly explain this heterogeneity by firm characteristics
   and the firm's purpose behind revealing. An analysis of reasons for
   revealing and of the type of revealed code shows that different types of
   firms have different rationales for openness. Implications for
   management are that the conflict between downsides and benefits of
   openness appears manageable. Provided selective revealing is practiced
   deliberately, the opportunities of open development dominate. (c) 2006

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The purpose of the study is to shed light on the antecedents and
   consequences of tension felt during international business negotiations.
   A total of 176 American and Chinese executives participated in simulated
   international business (buyer-seller) negotiations. The negotiations
   were videotaped, and the participants completed questionnaires. Each
   participant was also asked to review his/her videotaped negotiation,
   rate the tension felt on a videotape review form, and briefly describe
   the antecedents of the tension felt. The data collected were then
   analyzed using first a structural equations approach and then a more
   exploratory content analysis. Both Chinese and American executives felt
   tension during the negotiations. For the Chinese, greater levels of
   tension led to an increased likelihood of agreement, but also led to
   lower levels of interpersonal attraction and in turn lower trust for
   their American counterparts. For the Americans, tension felt decreased
   marginally the likelihood of an agreement, did not affect interpersonal
   attraction, but did have a direct negative effect on trust. A series of
   other cultural differences are also reported. The measure of tension
   felt developed in the study appears to be useful methodologically,
   theoretically, and practically.},

Abstract = {Some international organizations are governed by unanimity rule, others

   assume that the decisions made by voting are perfectly enforceable, have
   a hard time explaining the observed variation in governance mode, and in
   particular the widespread occurrence of the unanimity system. We present
   a model whose main departure from standard voting models is that the
   organization cannot rely on external enforcement mechanisms: each
   country is sovereign and cannot be forced to comply with the collective
   decision or, in other words, the voting system must be self-enforcing.
   The model identifies conditions under which the organization adopts the
   unanimity rule, and yields rich comparative-statics predictions on the
   determinants of the mode of governance.},

Year = {2006},
Volume = {101},

Abstract = {Evolutionary biological theories of group cooperation predict that (1)
   group members will tend to judge cooperative co-members favorably, and
   freeriding co-members negatively and (2) members who themselves
   cooperate more frequently will be especially likely to make these social
   judgments. An experiment tested these predictions among Shuar
   hunter-horticulturalists. Subjects viewed depictions of pairs of workers
   who varied in the extent to which they had contributed to, and benefited
   from, a team project. Subjects were then asked to judge which worker
   deserved more respect, and which deserved more punishment. When judging
   between unequal-contributors, all subjects tended to favor more
   cooperative (i.e., higher-contributing) workers. However, when judging
   between equal-contributors/unequal-benefiters, male subjects who
   themselves often engaged in team cooperation tended to favor more
   cooperative (i.e., lower-benefiting) workers, while subjects who were
   female and who therefore rarely engaged in team cooperation tended to
   favor less cooperative (i.e., higher-benefiting) workers. (c) 2006

Abstract = {This paper raises the question and provides empirical evidence regarding
   the status of the evolution of the state-owned enterprises (SOEs) in
   China today. In this study, we compare the SOEs to domestic
   private-owned enterprises (POEs) and foreign-controlled businesses
   (FCBs) in the context of their organizational cultures. While a new
   ownership form, many of the POEs evolved from former collectives that
   reflect the traditional values of Chinese business. Conversely, the FCBs
   are much more indicative of the large global MNCs. Therefore, we look at
   the SOES in the context of these two reference points. We conclude that
   the SOEs of today have substantially transformed to approximate a
   configuration desired by the Chinese government when it began the SOE
   transformation a couple of decades ago to make them globally
   competitive. The SOEs of today appear to be appropriately described as
   China's economic dynamic dynamo for the future. Copyright (c) 2006 John

Title = {The role of espoused national cultural values in technology acceptance},
Journal = {MIS QUARTERLY},
Year = {2006},
Volume = {30},
Number = {3},
Pages = {679-704},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Prior research has examined age, gender, experience, and voluntariness
   as the main moderators of beliefs on technology acceptance. This paper
   extends this line of research beyond these demographic and situational
   variables. Motivated by research that suggests that behavioral models do
   not universally hold across cultures, the paper identifies espoused
   national cultural values as an important set of individual difference
   moderators in technology acceptance. Building on research in
   psychological anthropology and cultural psychology that assesses
   cultural traits by personality tests at the individual level of
   analysis, we argue that individuals espouse national cultural values to
   differing degrees. These espoused national cultural values of
   masculinity/femininity, individualism/collectivism, power distance, and
   uncertainty avoidance are incorporated into an extended model of
   technology acceptance as moderators. We conducted two studies to test
   our model. Results indicated that, as hypothesized, social norms are
   stronger determinants of intended behavior for individuals who espouse
   feminine and high uncertainty avoidance cultural values. Contrary to
   expectations, espoused masculinity/femininity values did not moderate
   the relationship between perceived usefulness and behavioral intention
   but, as expected, did moderate the relationship between perceived ease
   of use and behavioral intention.},

Title = {Blaming leaders for organizational accidents: Proxy logic in collective-

Journal = {ORGANIZATIONAL BEHAVIOR AND HUMAN DECISION PROCESSES},
Year = {2006},
Volume = {101},
Number = {1},
Pages = {36-51},

Abstract = {The current research investigates whether observers blame leaders for
   organizational accidents even when these managers are known to be
   causally uninvolved. Past research finds that the public blames managers
   for organizational harm if the managers are perceived to have personally
   played a causal role. The present research argues that East Asian
   perceivers, who are culturally oriented to focus on the causal influence
   of groups {[}Menon, T., Morris, M. W., Chiu, C., \& Hong, Y. (1999).
   Culture and the construal of agency: Attribution to individual versus
   group dispositions. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 76,
   701-717.], blame managers based on the behavior of the group, not only
   based on the behavior of the individual managers. We argue that
   perceivers first assign responsibility to the collectivity, the
   organizational unit or some group within it, and then extend
   responsibility to the manager representing it. We tested this proposal
   in a series of studies with a community sample in Japan and matched
   student samples of Japanese and Americans. Results show that perceivers
   who are culturally oriented to focus on collective-level causality
   (Japanese, more so than Americans; Asian Americans, more so than
   European Americans) blame leaders through proxy logic. Implications of
   this intuitive logic and of the cultural difference are discussed. (c)

Abstract = {This paper investigates how groups or coalitions of players can act in

   equilibrium play is not assumed. The main idea is that each member of a
   coalition will confine play to a subset of their strategies if it is in
   their mutual interest to do so. An iterative procedure of restrictions
   is used to define a noncooperative solution concept, the set of
   coalitionally rationalizable strategies. The procedure is analogous to
   iterative deletion of never best response strategies, but operates on
   implicit agreements by different coalitions. The solution set is a
   nonempty subset of the rationalizable strategies.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ETHICS},
Year = {2006},
Volume = {67},
Number = {2},

Abstract = {Marcoux argues that job candidates ought to embellish non-verifiable
   information on their resumes because it is the best way to coordinate
   collective action in the resume game'. I do not dispute his analysis of
   collective action; I look at the larger picture, which throws light on
   the role game theory might play in ethics. I conclude that game theory's
   conclusions have nothing directly to do with ethics. Game theory
   suggests the means to certain ends, but the ethics of both the means and
   ends must be assessed separately before any ethical recommendation can
   be made. Marcoux makes several highly disputable assumptions in order to
   fit resumes into game theory; his analysis does not take into account
   the consequences that embellishing has beyond the submission and
   assessment of resumes; his argument depends on his claim that a resume
   system in which everyone embellishes is attainable; and finally, his
   argument relies on an idealization of human motivation, rather than
   abstraction. I conclude that candidates should never embellish their
   resumes.},

Title = {Industry-wide information systems standardization as collective action:
   The case of the US residential mortgage industry},
Journal = {MIS QUARTERLY},
Year = {2006},
Volume = {30},
Number = {SI},
Pages = {439-465},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Vertical information systems (VIS) standards are technical
   specifications designed to promote coordination among the organizations
   within (or across) vertical industry sectors. Examples include the bar
   code, electronic data interchange (EDI) standards, and RosettaNet
   business process standards in the electronics industry. This
   contribution examines VIS standardization through the lens of collective
   action theory, applied in the literature to information technology
   product standardization, but not yet to VIS standardization, which is
   led by heterogeneous groups of user organizations rather than by IT
   vendors. Through an intensive case analysis of VIS standardization in
   the U.S. residential mortgage industry, VIS standardization success is
   shown to be as problematic as IT product standardization success, but
   for different reasons.
   VIS standardization involves two linked collective action
   dilemmas-standards development and standards diffusion characteristics,
   such that a solution to the first may fail to resolve the second.
   Whereas prior theoretical and empirical research shows that IT product
   standardization efforts tend to splinter into rival factions that
   compete through standards wars in the marketplace, successful VIS
   standards consortia must encompass heterogeneous groups of user
   organizations and IT vendors without fragmenting. Some tactics
   successfully used to solve the collective action dilemma of VIS
   standardization (e.g., governance mechanisms and policies about
   intellectual property protection) are also used by IT product
   standardization efforts, but some are different, and successful VIS
   standardization requires a package of solutions tailored to fit and
   jointly resolve the specific dilemmas of particular VIS standards
   initiatives.},

Title = {When collections of creatives become creative collectives: A field study
   of problem solving at work},
Journal = {ORGANIZATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2006},
Volume = {17},
Number = {4},
Pages = {484-500},
Month = {JUL-AUG},
Abstract = {This paper introduces a model of collective creativity that explains how
   the locus of creative problem solving shifts, at times, from the
   individual to the interactions of a collective. The model is grounded in
   observations, inter-views, informal conversations, and archival data
   gathered in intensive field studies of work in professional service
   firms. The evidence suggests that although some creative solutions can
   be seen as the products of individual insight, others should be regarded
   as the products of a momentary collective process. Such collective
   creativity reflects a qualitative shift in the nature of the creative
   process, as the comprehension of a problematic situation and the
   generation of creative solutions draw from-and reframe-the past
   experiences of participants in ways that lead to new and valuable
   insights. This research investigates the origins of such moments, and
   builds a model of collective creativity that identifies the
   precipitating roles played by four types of social interaction: help
   seeking, help giving, reflective reframing, and reinforcing.
   Implications of this research include shifting the emphasis in research
   and management of creativity from identifying and managing creative
   individuals to understanding the social context and developing
   interactive approaches to creativity, and from a focus on relatively
   constant contextual variables to the alignment of fluctuating variables
   and their precipitation of momentary phenomena.},

Abstract = {Qualitative interviews and observations were conducted to study the
   cross-border transfer of organizational learning systems to the
   subsidiaries of five Japanese manufacturing companies operating in South
   China. This paper develops a holistic model of the overall process, by
   integrating knowledge-oriented, routine-oriented, and social/contextual
   perspectives, each of which plays a necessary role in explaining
   essential aspects. One feature of the transfer of organizational
   learning systems entailed arranging local access to, and opportunity to
   replicate, various types of knowledge repository that contained
   corporate values as well as technical expertise. A second feature
   involved the development of collective learning routines through dynamic
   interplay with evolving, locally based, knowledge repositories. A third
   feature, in two companies, entailed the creation of enterprise contexts
   that reproduced the socialization and corporate culture maintenance
   rituals, and the open plan factory and office designs, that were
   hallmarks of the respective parent companies, and which appeared highly
   conducive to the transfer of collective learning routines to the local
   sites. Findings indicate that successful cross-border transfer of
   organizational learning systems entails the development and
   implementation of an overall heuristic design for cultivating collective
   learning routines through the engineering of enterprise contexts and the
   responsive management of knowledge repositories.},

Title = {Psychological collectivism: A measurement validation and linkage to
   group member performance},

Volume = {91},

Pages = {884-899},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {The 3 studies presented here introduce a new measure of the
   individual-difference form of collectivism. Psychological collectivism
   is conceptualized as a multidimensional construct with the following 5
   facets: preference for in-groups, reliance on in-groups, concern for
   in-groups, acceptance of in-group norms, and prioritization of in-group
   goals. Study I developed and tested the new measure in a sample of
   consultants. Study 2 cross-validated the measure using an alumni sample
   of a Southeastern university, assessing its convergent validity with
   other collectivism measures. Study 3 linked scores on the measure to 4
   dimensions of group member performance (task performance, citizenship
   behavior, counter-productive behavior, and withdrawal behavior) in a
   computer software firm and assessed discriminant validity using the Big
   Five. The results of the studies support the construct validity of the
   measure and illustrate the potential value of collectivism as a
   predictor of group member performance.},

Title = {Strategic interaction and knowledge sharing in the KDE developer mailing
   list},
Journal = {MANAGEMENT SCIENCE},
Year = {2006},
Volume = {52},
Number = {7},
Pages = {1031-1042},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {In stark contrast with the fully participative ``bazaar{''} imagery of
   open source software (OSS) development, some recent empirical research
   has pointed out that much of the OSS development is carried out by a
   small percentage of developers. This raises serious concerns that
   concentration of development effort on a few will limit knowledge
   sharing and underutilize the available resources. Using the notion of
   strategic interaction, this paper argues that individual developers
   often interact strategically with other highly resourceful developers by
   forming a smaller but better organized structure to intensify the types
   of epistemic interactions that matter most to the OSS development. A
   general framework of strategic interaction including participation
   inequality, conversational interactivity, and cross-thread connectivity
   is proposed to examine its impact on knowledge sharing, and validated
   using 128 discussion threads from the K Desktop Environment (KDE)
   developer mailing list. The findings indicate that strategic interaction
   has expanded knowledge sharing but with the caveat that extreme
   concentration of development could have an opposite effect. For
   researchers, this study dovetails the incentive logic by proposing and
   validating the strategic aspects of OSS participation to better
   understand the collective dynamics underpinning OSS development.
   Practitioners can use this approach to evaluate and better support
   existing knowledge-sharing initiatives.},

Abstract = {This paper focuses on the role of knowledge in intentionally created
   business networks called nets. Nets are seen to offer firms collective
   benefits beyond those of a single firm or market transaction. We propose
   that the types of knowledge and learning required in the management of
   different types of business net are dependent on the value creation
   characteristics of the net types. Based on this we suggest a
   classification of three generic net types - `current business nets',
   `business renewal nets', and `emerging new business nets' - and argue
   that they pose different conditions for management in nets. Using this
   framework and integrating notions from the industrial network approach,
   strategic management and dynamic capabilities view, and organizational
   learning we make a number of observations and propositions about the
   role of knowledge and learning in the three types of business net. The
   paper contributes to the emerging theory of network management.},

Journal = {ORGANIZATIONAL BEHAVIOR AND HUMAN DECISION PROCESSES},
Year = {2006},
Volume = {100},
Number = {2},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Justice climates are considered to be an emergent phenomenon, which
   originates in the cognition, affect and behaviors of individuals, but is
   amplified by their interactions and manifests itself as a collective
   construct (see Kozlowski \& Klein, 2000). However, researchers have
   given little attention to the role of social interaction in the
   convergence of member justice perceptions in teams. Using conversational
   data from 372 students working in a team business simulation with two
   levels each of procedural treatment and outcome favorability, this study
   examines how treatment fairness arouses sense-making in teams and the
   features of such sensemaking processes that give rise to shared justice
   perceptions. The results highlight an interactive effect of outcomes and
   procedures on team sensemaking, which is shown to influence justice
   climate strength. The results also provide insight into the effects of
   discussion content, intensity and duration on the emergence of justice
   climates. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Motivation, governance, and the viability of hybrid forms in open source
   software development},
Journal = {MANAGEMENT SCIENCE},
Year = {2006},
Volume = {52},
Number = {7},
Pages = {1000-1014},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Open source software projects rely on the voluntary efforts of thousands
   of software developers, yet we know little about why developers choose
   to participate in this collective development process. This paper
   inductively derives a framework for understanding participation from the
   perspective of the individual software developer based on data from two
   software communities with different governance structures.
   In both communities, a need for software-related improvements drives
   initial participation. The majority of participants leave the community
   once their needs are met, however, a small subset remains involved. For
   this set of developers, motives evolve over time and participation
   becomes a hobby. These hobbyists are critical to the long-term viability
   of the software code: They take on tasks that might otherwise go undone
   and work to maintain the simplicity and modularity of the code.
   Governance structures affect this evolution of motives. Implications for
   firms interested in implementing hybrid strategies designed to combine
   the advantages of open source software development with proprietary
   ownership and control are discussed.},

Abstract = {The authors examine how country characteristics systematically moderate

   privacy/security protection on perceived value is stronger for people
   from countries with a weak rule of law, whereas people from countries
   that are high on national identity give more weight to whether there is
   cultural congruity between the site and themselves. People who live in
   more individualistic countries give more weight to pleasure, to
   privacy/security protection, and to customization in their perceived
   value judgments than people from collectivistic countries. The authors

Journal = {JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT STUDIES},
Year = {2006},
Volume = {43},
Number = {4},
Pages = {731-753},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {From a narrative perspective, organizations' identities are discursive
   (linguistic) constructs constituted by the multiple identity-relevant
   narratives that their participants author about them, and which feature,
   for example, in documents, conversations and electronic media. By
   defining collective identities as the totality of such narratives I draw
   attention to their complex, and often fragmented and heterogeneous
   nature. My approach contrasts with much of the theorizing in this field
   which has tended to homogenize collective identities by emphasizing what
   is common or shared, failed to capture the interplay between different
   communities within organizations, and produced bland, undifferentiated
   empirical research. In particular, the theoretical framework that I
   outline focuses attention on the importance of reflexivity, voice,
   plurivocity, temporality, and fictionality to an understanding of
   collective identities as locales for competing hegemonic claims. In
   combination, these notions form a unique conceptual model for theorizing
   and researching collective identities. This said, a narrative approach
   also has its limitations, and is proposed as an additional, not
   exclusive, interpretive lens.},

   of the individual lose sight of the whole corporate entity, and views
   which think of the corporation as a collective lose sight of the
   individual. A view which rejects both these alternatives sees the
   corporation as a type of community where there is a dynamic tension
   between the corporation as a whole and the individuals who are part of
   the organization. This view has implications relative to the focus of
   efforts to integrate ethics throughout an organization.},

Abstract = {Prisoner's dilemmas can lead rational people to interact in ways that
   lead to persistent inefficiencies. These dilemmas create a problem for
   institutional designers to solve: devise institutions that realign
   individual incentives to achieve collectively rational outcomes. I will
   argue that we do not always want to eliminate misalignments between
   individual incentives and efficient outcomes. Sometimes we want to
   preserve prisoner's dilemmas, even when we know that they systematically
   will lead to inefficiencies. No doubt, prisoner's dilemmas can create
   problems, but they also create opportunities to practice the cooperative
   norms that make market institutions possible in the first place. An
   ethical market culture, I argue, benefits from the presence of
   prisoner's dilemmas. I first consider standard approaches for solving
   prisoner's dilemmas. I then argue for the value of prisoner's dilemmas.
   Finally, I show the significance of this argument for advocating codes
   of business ethics.},

Abstract = {International surveys reveal wide differences between the views held in
   different countries concerning the causes of wealth or poverty and the
   extent to which people are responsible for their own fate. At the same
   time, social ethnographies and experiments by psychologists demonstrate
   individuals' recurrent struggle with cognitive dissonance as they seek
   to maintain, and pass on to their children, a view of the world where
   effort ultimately pays off and everyone gets their just desserts. This
   paper offers a model that helps explain i) why most people feel such a
   need to believe in a ``just world{''}; ii) why this need, and therefore
   the prevalence of the belief, varies considerably across countries; iii)
   the implications of this phenomenon for international differences in
   political ideology, levels of redistribution, labor supply, aggregate
   income, and popular perceptions of the poor. More generally, the paper
   develops a theory of collective beliefs and motivated cognitions,
   including those concerning ``money{''} (consumption) and happiness, as
   well as religion.},

Volume = {100},

Abstract = {Current research in organizational behavior suggests that organizations
   should adopt collectivistic values because they promote cooperation and
   productivity, while individualistic values should be avoided because
   they incite destructive conflict and opportunism. In this paper, we
   highlight one possible benefit of individualistic values that has not
   previously been considered. Because individualistic values can encourage
   uniqueness, such values might be useful when creativity is a desired
   outcome. Although we hypothesize that individualistic groups should be
   more creative than collectivistic groups, we also consider an important
   competing hypothesis: given that collectivistic groups are more
   responsive to norms, they might be more creative than individualistic
   groups when given explicit instructions to be creative. The results did
   not support this competing hypothesis and instead show that
   individualistic groups instructed to be creative are more creative than
   collectivistic groups given the same instructions. These results suggest
   that individualistic values may be beneficial, especially when
   creativity is a salient goal. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights

   organizations in both countries. We also maintain that differences in
   the essence of collectivism as well as in the extent of collectivism in

   sharing in Chinese and Russian organizations. Finally, we discuss

Abstract = {This article explores the structure of the ``metafield{''} of
   entrepreneurship in two related ways. First, author co-citation analysis
   establishes a collective view of the structure of the entrepreneurship
   literature as perceived by its research-active members. The co-citation
   frequencies of 78 prominent entrepreneurship researchers were analyzed
   using multivariate techniques. Cluster analysis and multidimensional
   scaling were used to explore the intellectual structure of
   entrepreneurship research by identifying groups of scholars whose work
   falls into similar areas. Factor analysis was then used to identify the
   underlying themes that characterize and define the field. Finally, the
   scholars within these nominal groupings were approached using
   individualized questionnaires to explore what social interactions might
   parallel, reflect, or underpin the intellectual ones. The study has
   given empirical support to a number of oft-quoted beliefs about
   entrepreneurship as a field of study, such as: (1) the occurrence of
   fragmentation from an early stage in its development; (2) that the
   difficulty of categorizing subfields unambiguously mirrors that in the
   metafield itself; (3) that there is a relative paucity of scholarship
   cited across-as opposed to within-these subfields; and (4) that there is
   evolution within the meta-field of national differences in the topics
   studied and citation patterns thereto. In addition, the study
   demonstrates that there are real and robust social and collaborative
   networks underlying the generation of the work which is cited jointly by
   third parties. The latter authors may be unaware of these networks.
   Equally, the co-cited authors, while recognizing overlapping interests,
   may have difficulty in categorizing this commonality in their
   contributions. Entrepreneurship research is shown to be very much a
   social activity, although this may be invisible to outsiders or
   novitiates.},

Abstract = {High-definition televisions should, by now be a huge success. Philips,
   Sony, and Thompson invested billions of dollars to develop TV sets with
   astonishing picture quality. From a technology perspective, they've
   succeeded: Console manufacturers have been ready for the mass market
   since the early 1990s. Yet the category has been an unmitigated failure,
   not because of deficiencies, but because critical complements such as
   studio production equipment were not developed or adopted in time.
   Under-performing complements have left console producers in the position
   of offering a Ferrari in a world without gasoline or highways-an
   admirable engineering feat, but not one that creates value for
   customers.
   The HDTV story exemplifies the promise and peril of innovation
   ecosystems-the collaborative arrangements through which firms combine
   their individual offers into a coherent, customer-facing solution. When
   they work, innovation ecosystems allow companies to create value that no
   one firm could have created alone. The benefits of these systems are
   real. But for many organizations the attempt at ecosystem innovation has
   been a costly failure. This is because, along with new opportunities,
   innovation ecosystems also present a new set of risks that can brutally
   derail a firm's best efforts.
   Innovation ecosystems are characterized by three fundamental types of
   risk: initiative risks-the familiar uncertainties of managing a project;
   interdependence risks the uncertainties of coordinating with
   complementary innovators; and integration risks-the uncertainties
   presented by the adoption process across the value chain. Firms that
   assess ecosystem risks holistically and systematically will be able to
   establish more realistic expectations, develop a more refined set of
   environmental contingencies, and arrive at a more robust innovation
   strategy. Collectively, these actions will lead to more effective
   implementation and more profitable innovation.},

Abstract = {Given the importance and prevalence of new venture failure, having a
   better understanding of the factors that affect its occurrence is a
   paramount research objective. In view of the increased focus on venture
   capital firms (VCFs) as important stakeholders for entrepreneurial
   ventures, in this study we examined the relationship between VCFs'
   investment strategies and their portfolio failure rates. We examined two
   aspects of a VCF's investment strategy: (1) the extent to which the VCF
   develops specialized expertise and (2) the extent to which the VCF
   undertakes investments in cooperation with other investors through
   syndication. We tested our hypotheses on longitudinal data of the
   realized strategies of 200 U.S.-based VCFs over a 12-year period. We
   found that a VCF's specialized development stage expertise had a
   negative effect on the proportion of defaults in the VCF's portfolio. We
   also found that the level of syndication positively-rather than
   negatively-affected the proportion of defaults. We discuss our findings
   from both theoretical and practical points of view.},

   architecture of an organization interacts with agency and emergent
   features to affect the extraction, generation, coordination, and

Journal = {INFORMATION SYSTEMS RESEARCH},
Year = {2006},
Volume = {17},
Number = {1},
Pages = {20-37},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Although its popularity is widespread, the Web is well known for one
   particular drawback: its frequent delay when moving from one page to
   another. This experimental study examined whether delay and two other
   website design variables (site breadth and content familiarity) have
   interaction effects on user performance, attitudes, and behavioral
   intentions. The three experimental factors (delay, familiarity, and
   breadth) collectively impact the cognitive costs and penalties that
   users incur when making choices in their search for target information.
   An experiment was conducted with 160 undergraduate business majors in a
   completely counterbalanced, fully factorial design that exposed them to
   two websites and asked them to browse the sites for nine pieces of
   information. Results showed that all three factors have strong direct
   impacts on performance and user attitudes, in turn affecting behavioral
   intentions to return to the site, as might be expected. A significant
   three-way interaction was found between all three factors indicating
   that these factors not only individually impact a user's experiences
   with a website, but also act in combination to either increase or
   decrease the costs a user incurs. Two separate analyses support an
   assertion that attitudes mediate the relationship of the three factors
   on behavioral intentions. The implications of these results for both
   researchers and practitioners are discussed. Additional research is
   needed to discover other factors that mitigate or accentuate the effects
   of delay, other effects of delay, and under what amounts of delay these
   effects occur.},

Abstract = {In two studies, we examined the joint effects of employed participants'
   self-concept levels and perceptions of fairness on organizational
   attitudes and citizenship behavior intentions. We examined the effects
   of chronic self-concept activation in Study 1, whereas we primed the
   working self-concept in Study 2. Combining the results of both studies,
   we found support for our hypotheses that particular self-concept levels
   and organizational justice dimensions interact to predict various
   work-related outcomes. Specifically, we observed interactions between
   the relational self-concept and interactional justice, and between the
   collective self-concept and procedural justice, such that the
   justice-outcome relationships were stronger for those experiencing
   higher activation on the relevant self-concept level. Thus, as
   hypothesized, justice information is weighted differently depending on
   the particular level of self-concept that is active. In addition,
   interesting direct effects of employees' self-concepts were also
   observed. We discuss the implications of these findings and the
   importance of considering the self-concept in conjunction with
   organizational justice. (c) 2006 Published by Elsevier Inc.},

Title = {Inside the mind of the Chinese consumer},
Journal = {HARVARD BUSINESS REVIEW},
Year = {2006},
Volume = {84},
Number = {3},
Pages = {68+},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {For the past three decades, the torrid pace of GDP growth in China has
   fascinated companies around the world. Western companies, in particular,
   have viewed the Middle Kingdom as a production powerhouse, a
   multinational marketer's dream come true, or an increasingly capable
   competitor in branded goods marketing. But are those views grounded in
   reality?
   To find out, the Gallup Organization undertook an ambitious ten-year,
   nationwide survey of Chinese consumers and employees. The group found
   that many of the perceptions held by companies outside-and even
   inside-China are inaccurate. Specifically, the findings belie at least
   four commonly held notions. The first is that the Chinese people,
   unmoored from collectivism, are now focused chiefly on working hard and
   getting rich. The second is that the Chinese workers now flooding the
   factories and offices of large cities are highly ambitious and actively
   engaged. The third is that the new prosperity in China allows consumers
   there to buy much of what they want. And the fourth is that there
   remains an endless hunger for household basics.
   Indeed, the survey found that most Chinese citizens are more interested
   in expressing their individuality than in getting rich. it also showed
   that Chinese workers are not as engaged by their jobs as the world might
   think. What's more, with the average citizen making less than \$1,800
   per year, only the affluent have extra money to spend. Finally, the
   average Chinese consumer is more interested in buying luxury and
   entertainment items than in purchasing basic household goods.
   The Gallup survey provides much-needed scope and depth of hard data
   documenting the Chinese consumer-giving policy makers and executives the
   tools to manage the opportunities and challenges in China.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT STUDIES},
Year = {2006},
Volume = {43},
Number = {2},
Pages = {343-365},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The theme of this paper is the relationship between emotion, management
   and organization, specifically, how emotions are transformed by
   rationalizations, and vice versa. It is argued that managers' tendency
   to rationalize emotion creates additional emotional dynamics, and that
   these provide opportunities for organizing reflection. This idea also
   points to a limitation of approaches that are concerned with how
   emotions can be managed through emotional intelligence. The study took
   place during a turbulent period in the history of a company, while it
   was being taken over. Managers in Hyder plc, formerly the largest stock
   market listed corporation in Wales, UK, carried a tension into their
   work roles. This was created from particular emotions (pain and shame)
   and their rationalizations of, or detachment from, these emotions
   (self-interest and disinterest). Such tension was a necessary part of
   maintaining their managerial role under difficult and emotionally
   charged circumstances. The study also showed how fears about personal
   position undermined the ability of managers to enact their authority and
   to act collectively within the organization. The conclusion discusses
   the relationship between collective emotional dynamics (political
   relatedness) and the organization of reflection, as well as providing
   questions for further research.},

Abstract = {The western-based leadership and ethics literatures were reviewed to
   identify the key characteristics that conceptually define what it means
   to be an ethical leader. Data from the Global Leadership and
   Organizational Effectiveness (GLOBE) project were then used to analyze
   the degree to which four aspects of ethical leadership -
   Character/Integrity, Altruism, Collective Motivation, and Encouragement
   - were endorsed as important for effective leadership across cultures.
   First, using multi-group confirmatory factor analyses measurement
   equivalence of the ethical leadership scales was found, which provides
   indication that the four dimensions have similar meaning across
   cultures. Then, using analysis of variance (ANOVA) tests each of the
   four dimensions were found to be universally endorsed as important for
   effective leadership. However, cultures also varied significantly in the
   degree of endorsement for each dimension. In the increasingly global
   business environment, these findings have implications for organizations
   implementing ethics programs across cultures and preparing leaders for

   deeply ingrained in our social fabric and richly portrayed in

   of injuries and losses experienced earlier in the lifetime of a system,
   fed by an institution's inability to acknowledge guilt and to integrate
   love and hate, and driven by the desire for `repair' via retaliation. As
   open and direct acts of both revenge and violence are largely taboo,
   they are broadly denied in contemporary society at large and in
   organizations in particular. Despite that denial, the underlying
   feelings and the desire to persecute remain real. Thus revenge often is
   wreaked unconsciously by sophisticated and hidden means. This article is
   guided by the working hypothesis that vengeance from a socio-analytic
   perspective is a psychosocial phenomenon and a dynamic of the
   collective, that is, the community or polis of related people. In social
   (political and economic) contexts, its inherent aggression and
   annihilation is often hidden behind an apparent logic of rationality
   justice, and competition.},

   Study 2, 148 master of business administration students were exposed to
   a task interdependence manipulation and then rated the importance of OCB
   in their evaluations of employee performance. In Study 3, 130 managers
   rated the task interdependence in their unit of principal responsibility
   and the importance of OCB in their overall evaluations of employee
   performance. The results suggest task interdependence may affect the
   importance attributed to OCB by evaluators. Implications of these

   choice is greater for consumers who rate high on either collectivism or
   uncertainty avoidance. Credible brands provide more value to
   collectivist consumers because such consumers perceive these brands as
   being of higher quality (i.e., reinforcing group identity). Credible
   brands provide more value to high-uncertainty-avoidance consumers

Abstract = {This paper develops an expectancy model for Chinese-American differences
   in conflict-avoiding, and tests this model using a scenario study with
   respondents from Taiwan and the US. Our results show that a higher
   Chinese tendency to avoid conflict is explained by higher Chinese
   expectations that direct conflict will hurt the relationship with the
   other party, and by greater concern for the other party among Chinese.
   It is not, however, explained by differences in the expected career
   costs/benefits of good/bad relations with others. Also, Chinese are more
   sensitive to hierarchy than Americans, so that avoiding is heightened
   more for Chinese than for Americans when the other party is of higher
   status. Qualitative results suggest that Chinese-American differences in
   time frames may also explain differences in avoiding. Implications for
   businesses and management are suggested.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ETHICS},
Year = {2006},
Volume = {63},
Number = {2},
Pages = {149-154},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Several attempts have been made to transfer the concept of informed
   consent from medical and research ethics to dealing with affected groups
   in other areas such as engineering, land use planning, and business
   management. It is argued that these attempts are unsuccessful since the
   concept of informed consent is inadequate for situations in which groups
   of affected persons are dealt with collectively (rather than
   individually, as in clinical medicine). There are several reasons for
   this. The affected groups from which informed consent is sought cannot
   be identified with sufficient precision. Informed consent is associated
   with individual veto power, but it does not appear realistic to give
   veto power to all individuals who are affected for instance by an
   engineering project. Most importantly, the concept of informed consent
   puts focus on the public's acceptance of ready-made proposals rather
   than on its participation in the decision-making process as a whole,
   which includes the development of alternatives for the decision.
   Therefore, the concept of informed consent is not applicable to a
   company's relations with groups and collectives. It may, however, be
   applicable to a company's relations with individual persons such as
   customers and employees.},

   In this paper, we analyze the concept of cronyism and argue that it
   comes in various guises arising from different motivational bases and
   power dependence relations. We distinguish cronyism from related
   constructs and posit that it is a form of corruption with different
   dynamics from other forms. We advance propositions on its likelihood of

Volume = {27},

Abstract = {Through a rich empirical study of forms of collective action in Ghana,
   this paper examines how groups sustain co-operation in the absence of
   strong legal institutions and mechanisms (such as legal contracts or
   regulated loan finance) that are often taken for granted in most
   `western' economies. It presents evidence from case studies of
   micro-saving groups, palm oil processing groups and transport
   associations, which indicate that co-operation is based on trust and
   power, both of which are based on culturally specific norms. Decisions
   to co-operate are shaped by a combination of conscious calculations,
   habitual actions and unquestioning compliance or obedience. The way that
   trust and power are articulated also varies according to local context,
   and attempts to facilitate and support co-operative activities have to
   build on the existing co-operative structures that are embedded in the
   local, culturally specific, social relations.},

Abstract = {Applied ethicists say little about resume embellishment. Presumably,
   this is so because resume embellishment seems obviously wrong; an
   instance of ordinary lying, familiar moral prohibitions against which
   cover the case completely. Analysis of resume embellishment merely as
   ordinary lying overlooks its collective action aspects. Taking account
   of those aspects and their implications, I argue on consequentialist
   grounds that, given some plausible background conditions, a limited form
   of resume embellishment is morally permissible (and perhaps required).
   This outcome is a particular instantiation of a more general principle
   about how one ought to act when participating in a morally valuable
   co-ordinative practice. I conclude by identifying implications for how
   employers ought to use resumes in hiring decisions.},

Volume = {16},

Pages = {45-56},
Abstract = {Two studies investigated the effects of charity advertising on
   perceptions of moral obligation to help others and gauged ad evaluation.
   This was done in cultures that were similar in individualism but
   differed in either masculinity (United States and Canada) or femininity
   (Denmark and Norway). Participants read appeals that solicited donations
   to charity by focusing on either egoistic or altruistic motives. In
   masculine cultures, men preferred the egoistic ad and women preferred
   the altruistic one. In feminine cultures, where women are agentic and
   men are allowed to be nurturing, the opposite was the case. Exposure to
   both types of ads activated a sense of personal obligation among men in
   feminine nations and women in masculine nations. However, their
   opposite-sex counterparts reacted against these ads. Implications of
   these findings for an understanding of culture and sex differences in

Title = {High power, low power, and equality: Culture beyond individualism and
   collectivism},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CONSUMER PSYCHOLOGY},
Year = {2006},
Volume = {16},
Number = {4},
Pages = {352-356},
Abstract = {Models of culture are operationalized as individualism and collectivism
   and have not given sufficient attention to other organizing
   axes-especially how a society handles power, dependence, and equality.
   Shavitt, Lalwani, Zhang, and Torelli (2006) make a significant
   contribution by first reminding the field of power distance (Hofstede,
   1980) and then moving beyond a single factor to highlight benefits of
   Triandis' (1995) horizontal (valuing equality)
   individualism-collectivism and vertical (emphasizing hierarchy)
   individualism-collectivism model. But this approach makes it difficult
   to disentangle the effects of power and individualism or collectivism;
   priming procedures and experimental variations of power can counter this
   limitation. Moreover, current horizontal/vertical approaches do not
   distinguish between having and not having power, although social
   cognition research documented differential effects of high and low power
   on content of self-concept, relationality, and cognition, which suggest
   previously neglected cultural differences.},

   examined prescheduled meetings attended in a typical week (N = 676),
   whereas Study 2 investigated prescheduled meetings attended during the
   current day (N = 304). As proposed, the relationship between meeting
   time demands and JAWB was moderated by task interdependence, meeting
   experience quality, and accomplishment striving. However, results were
   somewhat dependent on the time frame of a study and the operational
   definition used for meeting time demands. Furthermore, perceived meeting
   effectiveness was found to have a strong, direct relationship with JAWB.},

Abstract = {We argue for the importance of a relatively new cultural distinction in
   the horizontal (valuing equality) or vertical (emphasizing hierarchy)
   nature of cultures and cultural orientations. A review of the existing
   cross-cultural literature is presented suggesting that, although the
   contribution of the horizontal/vertical distinction is sometimes
   obscured by methods that conflate it with other dimensions, its impact
   is distinct from that associated with individualism-collectivism. We
   present studies that highlight several sources of value for the
   horizontal/vertical distinction-as a predictor of new consumer
   psychology phenomena and as a basis for refining the understanding of
   known phenomena. Results support the utility of examining this
   distinction for the understanding of personal values, advertising and
   consumer persuasion, self-presentational patterns, and gender
   differences. Methodological issues in studying the horizontal/vertical
   distinction are also discussed.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF CONSUMER PSYCHOLOGY},
Year = {2006},
Volume = {16},
Number = {3},
Pages = {240-248},
Abstract = {When both independent and interdependent self-concepts are available,
   priming either self-concept will increase the accessibility in memory of
   the motivations and cognitions associated with it. Thus, priming the
   interdependent self may activate motivation to maintain harmony and
   conform to others' opinions, whereas priming the independent self is
   likely to activate motivation to be independent and to withstand social
   pressure. Two experiments investigated implications of these
   possibilities for judgments of risk when participants anticipated (or
   not) explaining their judgments to others. Participants relied on
   others' beliefs only when their interdependent self was primed and they
   expected they might have to explain their judgments to others. When
   their independent self was primed, expectations to communicate their
   judgments had no effect. Culture-based differences in individualism vs.
   collectivism had no impact on these effects.},

Year = {2005},
Volume = {50},
Number = {4},
Pages = {576-609},

Abstract = {To better understand the connection between organizational identity and
   how organizations relate to their stakeholders, this paper introduces
   the construct of identity orientation, previously applied at the
   individual-level of ana ys s, at the organizational-level of analysis
   and proposes that organizations have three distinct identity
   orientations: individualistic, relational, and collectivistic. In a
   field study using qualitative and quantitative methods and including
   1,126 participants from 88 organizations in the legal services and
   non-alcoholic beverage industries, I assess the constructs viability,
   explore its properties, and analyze its predictors at multiple levels of
   analysis. Results reveal that organizations' relations with stakeholders
   constitute a prominent feature of organizational identity, that
   relations with external and internal stakeholders are perceived as
   tightly coupled, that both pure and hybrid identity orientation types
   are relatively common, and that identity orientation varies widely among
   business organizations. Further, specific organizational variables
   bearing on organizations' stakeholder relations appear to be stronger
   predictors of identity orientation than general organizational-level or
   individual-level variables. Implications for a range of literatures
   addressing organizations' external (stakeholder management,
   interorganizational relations) and internal relations (human resource
   management, psychological contracts) are discussed.},

Journal = {CONTEMPORARY ACCOUNTING RESEARCH},
Year = {2005},
Volume = {22},
Number = {4},
Pages = {915-963},
Month = {WIN},
Abstract = {This paper uses stock market data to investigate the popular claim that
   investors are misled by the ``pro forma{''} earnings numbers
   conspicuously featured in the press releases of some U.S. firms. We
   first document the frequency and magnitude of pro forma earnings in
   press releases issued during June through August 2000, and describe the
   433 firms that engaged in this financial disclosure strategy. Our test
   period predates public expressions of concern by trade associations and
   regulators that pro forma earnings may mislead investors and the
   subsequent issuance of guidelines and rules on the disclosure of pro
   forma earnings numbers. We use two complementary approaches to determine
   whether the share prices that investors assign to pro forma firms are
   systematically higher than the prices assigned to other firms. Our
   market-multiples tests for differences in price levels find some
   evidence suggesting that pro forma firms may be priced higher than firms
   that do not use the disclosure strategy. This apparent overpricing is
   not, however, related to the pro forma earnings numbers themselves. Our
   narrow-window stock returns tests reveal no evidence of a stock return
   premium for pro forma firms at the quarterly earnings announcement date.
   Collectively, the results cast doubt on the notion that investors are,
   on average, misled by pro forma earnings disclosures despite the
   widespread concern expressed in the financial press and by regulators.},

Abstract = {Based on the institutional vs the individual view of culture and the
   theory of individualism-collectivism in explaining the in-group-outgoup

   systems were in place. We also predicted that Chinese would be less
   cooperative with foreigners than with fellow Chinese when they were in a
   foreign territory, whereas Australians would be equally cooperative with
   members of both groups. Data from two cross-national experiments
   provided general support for these predictions. Moreover, the results of

Abstract = {Knowledge embedded in a group's structures and processes can be
   leveraged to create sustainable advantage for organizations. We propose
   that knowledge embedded with a transactive memory system (TMS) helps
   groups apply prior learning to new tasks and develop an abstract
   understanding of a problem domain, leading to sustained performance. We
   present a framework for understanding TMSs as learning systems that
   affect group learning and learning transfer, and we test the major
   outcomes of the framework in an empirical study. We found that groups
   with a prior TMS and experience with two tasks in the same domain were
   more likely to develop an abstract understanding of the principles
   relevant to the task domain-a critical factor for learning transfer in
   general. We did not, however, find strong support for our contention
   that a TMS facilitates learning transfer after experience with only a
   single task. Further examinations of our findings showed that the extent
   to which members maintained expertise across tasks influenced the degree
   of learning transfer, especially for groups whose members had previously
   developed a TMS with another group. Our findings show that a TMS has
   broader benefits beyond the task for which it first developed because a
   TMS affects members' ability to apply prior learning and develop a
   collective, abstract understanding of the task domain. More generally,
   our study demonstrates that TMSs influence group learning and learning
   transfer. We discuss our study's implications for practice and for TMS
   and group learning theories.},

Title = {Toward a model of issue-selling by subsidiary managers in multinational
   organizations},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS STUDIES},
Year = {2005},
Volume = {36},
Number = {6},
Pages = {637-654},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {In multinational organizations, local market responsiveness is critical
   to the development of effective strategies. This responsiveness is
   expected to occur in part as the result of upward influence from local
   subsidiary managers, who represent the local culture and shift relevant
   priorities accordingly. Issue-selling - defined as directing top
   management's attention to particular issues and helping them understand
   such issues - is one important way in which subsidiary managers pursue
   upward influence. The purpose of this paper is to help multinational
   organizations better facilitate and exploit potentially valuable input
   from local subsidiary managers. To do so, we propose an acculturated
   view of issue-selling. More specifically, we argue that subsidiary
   managers socialized by different national cultures vary: ( 1) in the
   extent to which their intention to sell issues is influenced by various
   contextual cues; and ( 2) in their choice of selling strategies. These
   theoretical differences suggest that local subsidiary managers from
   different cultures will differ in the way they approach issue-selling
   and, in turn, in the way they influence the strategy-making process. The
   discussion traces the implications of this line of reasoning for future
   research on the influence of local subsidiary managers and, more
   generally, for research on the cultural embeddedness of the strategy
   process.},

Title = {Paradoxes from the individualization of human resource management: The
   case of telework},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ETHICS},
Year = {2005},
Volume = {62},
Number = {1},
Pages = {13-24},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {In the context of change to the ``new modernity{''} described in Beck's
   work, companies develop management modes and methods that focus more and
   more on individuals. Constitutive of the individualization process,
   human resources practices have become ambivalent as the process itself.
   This contribution examines how a managerial and organizational
   innovation as telework contributes to the process of individualization,
   and the paradoxes it addresses to management. At the interface of the
   social and the technical, teleworking appears as a flexible arrangement,
   meeting employees' and employer's demands - which is a characteristic of
   the process of individualization - by simultaneously fragmenting
   collectivity, exposing individuals to social risk, and producing
   exclusion. The authors focus on two consecutive paradoxes of such
   individualized managerial practices: the individual-collective dilemma
   and the autonomy-control paradox. Finally, the paper reveals HRM as a
   new institution of individualization in a world where regulation
   functions are more and more transferred to individuals themselves.},

Year = {2005},
Volume = {30},
Number = {7-8},
Pages = {691-733},
Month = {OCT-NOV},
Abstract = {This paper analyses how two companies pursued integration of management
   and control through enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems. We
   illustrate how the quest for integration is an unending process and it
   is produced concurrently and episodically. Integration is not only about
   `mere' visibility and control at a distance. ERP systems do not define
   what integration is and how it is to be developed, but they incur a
   techno-logic that conditions how control can be performed through
   financial and non-financial representations because they distinguish
   between an accounting mode and a logistics mode. A primary lesson from
   our cases is that control cannot be studied apart from technology and
   context because one will never get to understand the underlying
   `infrastructure'-the meeting point of many technologies and many types
   of controls. ERP systems are particularly interesting for what they make
   impossible, and our cases illustrate how the two organizations in the
   quest for integration mobilized a number of `boundary objects' to
   overcome systems-based `blind spots' and `trading zones'. The paper
   points out that management control in an ERP-environment is not a
   property of the accounting function but a collective affair were local
   control issues in different parts of the organization are used to create
   notions of global management. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {The literature on systems of innovation conceptualises innovation as an
   evolutionary and social process of collective learning. But three main
   questions remain open: is this learning process rather internal or
   external? What are the boundaries of this process? Is this social
   process voluntary or rather unintended? This paper strives to tackle
   those questions by analysing the determinants of regional innovative
   levels in French manufacturing industries. By estimating a knowledge
   production function we find that building external interactions is of
   greater importance than developing internal innovative competences.
   Second, unintended knowledge flows have less influence on regional
   innovative performance than deliberate ones. Lastly, the French
   innovation system looks regional rather than sectoral. (c) 2005 Elsevier

Abstract = {The goal of this study was to introduce a model explaining how managers'

   deal with employee bribery in organizations. Twenty-six internal and

   attributions, together with the other variables in the model, were
   evaluated by 354 (n = 354) Ecuadorian managers. Hierarchical regression
   analyses indicated that attitudes and external attributions
   significantly predicted managers' intentions to discipline employees who
   accepted a bribe. In addition, external attributions mediated the
   relationship between individualism-collectivism and intent to discipline
   corrupt employees. Implications for the management of bribery in Latin

Abstract = {The literature acknowledges a distinction between immoral, amoral and
   moral management. This paper makes a case for the employee (at any
   level) as a moral agent, even though the paper begins by highlighting a
   body of evidence which suggests that individual moral agency is
   sacrificed at work and is compromised in deference to other pressures.
   This leads to a discussion about the notion of discretion and an
   examination of a separate, contrary body of literature which indicates
   that some individuals in corporations may use their discretion to behave
   in a socially entrepreneurial manner. My underlying assumption is that
   CSR isn't solely driven by economics and that it may also be championed
   as a result of a personal morality, inspired by employees' own socially
   oriented personal values. A conceptual framework is put forward and it
   is suggested that individuals may be categorized as Active or Frustrated
   Corporate Social Entrepreneurs; Conformists or Apathetics, distinguished
   by their individualistic or collectivist personal values. In a
   discussion of the nature of values, this paper highlights how values may
   act as drivers of our behavior and pays particular attention to the
   values of the entrepreneur, thereby linking the existing debate on moral
   agency with the field of corporate social responsibility.},

Abstract = {The notion of a `community-of-practice' (CmP) has become a highly
   influential way of conceptualizing how decentralized sub-units or groups
   within firms or organizations operate. CmPs refer to `tightly knit'
   groups that have been practising together long enough to develop into a
   cohesive community with relationships of mutuality and shared
   understandings. The CmP notion, however, does not fit squarely with how
   temporary organizations or project organizations operate. Typically
   these kinds of groups consist of diversely skilled individuals, most of
   whom have not met before, who have to solve a problem or carry out a
   pre-specified task within tightly set limits as to time and costs. As a
   result they tend to become less well-developed groups, operating on a
   minimal basis of shared knowledge and understandings. Such a group, I
   suggest, constitutes a `collectivity-of-practice' (C1P). Mirroring the
   above distinctions, two ideal-type notions of epistemology are
   developed. The one inspired from the CmP literature is discussed in a
   `knowledge community' terminology, whereas the one associated with C1Ps
   is conceived of as a `knowledge collectivity'. Finally, I outline some
   new options for organizational analysis made possible by recognizing
   these as two different and complementary notions.},

Abstract = {The authors examined how networks of teams integrate their efforts to

   align efforts among multiple teams are important predictors of multiteam
   performance. The authors used a multiteam system (MTS) simulation to
   assess how both cross-team and within-team processes relate to NITS
   performance over multiple performance episodes that differed in terms of
   required interdependence levels. They found that cross-team processes
   predicted MTS performance beyond that accounted for by within-team
   processes. Further, cross-team processes were more important for MTS
   effectiveness when there were high cross-team interdependence demands as
   compared with situations in which teams could work more independently.
   Results are discussed in terms of extending theory and applications from
   teams to multiteam systems.},

Abstract = {This paper draws on the quality profitability emphasis framework of

   Peter R. Dickson. 2002. Getting returns from service quality: Revenue
   expansion, cost reduction, or both. J. Marketing 66(October) 7-24.) to
   examine the association between customer satisfaction and long-term
   financial performance among firms that achieve a dual emphasis (focusing
   on both revenue-expansion and cost-reduction simultaneously, rather than
   solely emphasizing one over the other). Using a longitudinal data set of
   77 firms from the United States, we test this hypothesis and find that
   the association between customer satisfaction and long-term financial
   performance is positive and relatively stronger for firms that
   successfully achieve a dual emphasis. We build on the work of Rust,
   Moorman, and Dickson (2002), who investigated the financial impact of
   engaging in the process of achieving a dual emphasis. Collectively,
   these studies show that while achieving a dual emphasis is desirable for
   long-run financial success, the process of achieving a dual emphasis may
   not be as financially rewarding in the short run. Firms pursuing a dual
   emphasis need to consider both short- and long-term consequences of
   their strategy.},

Abstract = {How to address empirically the calculative character of markets without
   dissolving it? In our paper, we propose a theoretical framework that
   helps to deal with markets without suspending their calculative
   properties. In the first section, we construct a broad definition of
   calculation, grounded on the anthropology of science and techniques. In
   the next sections, we apply this definition to three constitutive
   elements of markets: economic goods, economic agents and economic
   exchanges. First, we examine the question of the calculability of goods:
   in order to be calculated, goods must be calculable. In the following
   section, we introduce the notion of calculative distributed agencies to
   understand how these calculable goods are actually calculated. Thirdly,
   we consider the rules and material devices that organize the encounter
   between (and aggregation of) individual supplies and demands, i.e. the
   specific organizations that allow for a calculated exchange and a market
   output. Those three elements define concrete markets as collective
   organized devices that calculate compromises on the values of goods. In
   each, we encounter different versions of our broad definition of
   calculation, which we illustrate with examples, mainly taken from the
   fields of financial markets and mass retail.},

Volume = {60},

Pages = {47-62},

Abstract = {Because of the importance of Confucian doctrines in shaping ethical
   business practices under Chinese leadership, revealing the roles of
   other Chinese ethical doctrines in modern Chinese leadership is
   informative. A thorough understanding of the ethical foundations of
   Chinese leadership is necessary for fruitful interaction with Chinese
   leaders, according to cultural fit theory. The present study illustrates
   the philosophical foundations of business management, based on dialogues
   with five eminent corporate executive officers (CEOs). It reveals that
   the CEOs practice a style of Chinese leadership synthesizing Confucian,
   Daoist, Mohist, and Legalist doctrines. The Confucian doctrines advocate
   benevolence, harmony, learning, loyalty, righteousness, and humility.
   They are the most prevalent tenets that support paternalism and
   collectivism. The Daoist doctrines emphasize flexibility and reversion
   (e.g., the principle that the weak can defeat the strong). They bolster
   the leader's forbearance. The Mohist doctrines underpin thrift and
   working with the masses whereas the Legalist doctrines inculcate
   self-control and innovativeness. Hence, contemporary Chinese leadership
   does not rely exclusively on Confucian ethics and this reflects
   evolution over 1000s of years.},

   collectivization, the Chinese government accelerated its aggressive
   industrialization timetable. Grain output fell sharply as the government
   diverted agricultural resources to industry and imposed an excessive
   grain procurement burden on peasants, leaving them with insufficient
   calories to sustain labor productivity. Our analysis shows that 61

Abstract = {I summarize my view of organization theory and then explain how it
   developed over my life. I stress that it arose gradually from a series
   of empirical tests, so that my views are based on good reasons, despite
   being in some ways unconventional. Early influences upon me include the
   non-conformist climate of my school days and the empirical ethos at the
   University of Aston. I have long been interested in the creation of
   social science. This has been informed by the philosophy of science,
   which emphasizes the centrality of theory and its empirical testing. My
   early work in the Aston programme laid the basis for commitment to
   functionalism and generalization. The vociferous rejection of this style
   of research by ideologically oriented critics led me to defend it, both
   theoretically and philosophically. My later work on strategy and
   structure led me to reject strategic choice and embrace situational
   determinism. I analysed these and other research topics as being within
   structural contingency theory. I also used this theory frequently in my
   business school teaching. In the USA, newer theories arose, which,
   collectively, fragmented organizational theory. I critiqued these
   theories, and this fragmentation. Moreover, I became convinced that
   contingency theory in its classic variant is more correct than newer
   variants, and offered detailed argumentation. My empirical research also
   found that crises of low performance triggered adaptive structural
   change. From that, I created organizational portfolio theory, which
   draws upon finance to explain performance fluctuations and the resultant
   organizational change and lack of change. More recently, I offered an
   integrated statement of structural contingency theory and ideas for its
   future development theoretically and methodologically.},

   network researchers. We propose three frontiers for future network
   research that zoom back and forth between individual and collective
   levels of analysis. First, we consider how dilemmas concerning social
   capital can be reconciled. Actors striving to reap maximal network
   advantages may benefit or detract from the collective good;
   investigating these trade-offs, we argue, will advance our understanding
   of learning and knowledge processes in organizations. Second, we explore
   identity emergence and change from a social network perspective.
   Insights about how networks mold and signal identity are a critical
   foundation for future work on career dynamics and the workplace
   experiences of members of diverse groups. Third, we consider how
   individual cognitions about shifting network connections affect, and are
   affected by, larger social structures. As scholarly interest in status
   and reputational signaling grows, articulating more clearly the
   cognitive foundations of organizational networks becomes imperative.},

Journal = {HARVARD BUSINESS REVIEW},

Volume = {83},

Pages = {162+},
Month = {JUL-AUG},
Abstract = {Groups don't become teams just because that is what someone calls them.
   Nor do teamwork values alone ensure team performance. So what is a team?
   How can managers know when the team option makes sense, and what can
   they do to ensure team success? In this groundbreaking 1993 article,
   authors Jon Katzenbach and Douglas Smith answer these questions and
   outline the discipline that defines a real team.
   The essence of a team is shared commitment. Without it, groups perform
   as individuals; with it, they become a powerful unit of collective
   performance. The best teams invest a tremendous amount of time shaping a
   purpose that they can own. They also translate their purpose into
   specific performance goals. And members of successful teams pitch in and
   become accountable with and to their teammates.
   The fundamental distinction between teams and other forms of working
   groups turns on performance. A working group relies on the individual
   contributions of its members for collective performance. But a team
   strives for something greater than its members could achieve
   individually: An effective team is always worth more than the sum of its
   parts.
   The authors identify three kinds of teams: those that recommend
   things-task forces or project groups; those that make or do
   things-manufacturing, operations, or marketing groups; and those that
   run things-groups that oversee some significant functional activity. For
   managers, the key is knowing where in the organization these teams
   should be encouraged. Managers who can foster team development in the
   right place at the right time prime their organizations for top
   performance.},

Year = {2005},
Volume = {59},
Number = {4},
Pages = {347-360},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Applying evidence from recently available public information on Enron, I
   defined Enron's culture as one rooted in agency theory by asserting that
   Enron's members were predominantly agency-reasoning individuals. I then
   identified conditions present at Enron's collapse: a strong agency
   culture with collectively noncompliant norms, a munificent rare-faflure
   environment, and new hires with little business ethics training. Turning
   to four possible antidotes (selection, objectivist integrity, integrity
   capacity, and stewardship reasoning) to an agency culture under these
   conditions, I argued that the currently available ethics literature
   would have made little difference toward averting Enron's collapse if
   any of the recommendations from the relevant ethics literature had been
   implemented. I conclude by identifying new directions for business
   ethics literature in order to make it more implementable under the
   conditions identified at Enron. Essentially, we need a way to clearly
   determine (1) the difference between connivance and commitment, (2) what
   is meant by balance with regard to the multiple dimensions of ethics and
   legal theories, and (3) the proper balance between agency and
   stewardship reasoning.},

Journal = {HARVARD BUSINESS REVIEW},
Year = {2005},
Volume = {83},
Number = {7-8},
Pages = {74+},
Month = {JUL-AUG},
Abstract = {When we do our best work as leaders, we don't imitate others. Rather, we
   draw on our own values and capabilities. We enter what author Robert
   Quinn calls the fundamental state of leadership. This is a frame of mind
   we tend to adopt when facing a significant challenge: a promotion
   opportunity, the risk of professional failure, a serious illness, a
   divorce, the death of a loved one, or any other major life jolt. Crisis
   calls, and we rise to the occasion.
   But we don't need to spend time in the dark night of the soul to reach
   this fundamental state. We can make the shift at any time by asking
   ourselves-and honestly answering -four transformative questions:
   Am I results centered? (Am I willing to leave my comfort zone to make
   things happen?)
   Am I internally directed? (Am I behaving according to my values rather
   than bending to social or political pressures?)
   Am I other focused? (Am I putting the collective good above my own
   needs?)
   Am I externally open? (Am I receptive to outside stimuli that may signal
   the need for change?)
   When we can answer these questions in the affirmative, we're prepared to
   lead in the truest sense.
   Of course, we can't sustain the fundamental state of leadership
   indefinitely. Fatigue and external resistance pull us out of it. But
   each time we reach it, we then return to our everyday selves a bit more
   capable, and we usually boost the performance of the people around us.
   Over time we create a high-performance culture-and that can be
   sustained.},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The innovativeness of a region depends on its ability to recombine
   technological, organisational and scientific capabilities. This
   recombination can be facilitated by regional policies. In the past,
   these policies provided a stable set of ``local collective competition
   goods{''} supporting interorganisational patterns of cooperation,
   communication and competition. Given the increasing uncertainties of an
   internationalised knowledge society, these stable regional orders are
   challenged by new, more open-ended and experimental patterns of regional
   policies. These policies treat regions as social fields whose political
   and economic boundaries, identities, dominant coalitions and governance
   structures are constructed in bargaining and exchange relations. Also
   the type of collective competition goods required and their target
   groups are the result of negotiations involving not only political
   actors and business associations but also enterprises and trade unions.
   This shift to a discursive renewal of regional capabilities, as well as
   the difficulties and limitations encountered by such ``experimental
   regionalism{''}, is illustrated on the basis of an East and a West
   German region. Leipzig had to create a new economic and business
   structure and to integrate the existing firms into regional networks in
   order to enhance its innovative capabilities. In Leipzig, these two
   challenges were met by separate, newly created institutions thus
   hampering the regional integration and innovativeness of the recently
   recreated industrial basis. In Nuremberg, the transformation of a
   traditional industrial region into a technology and service-based one
   was facilitated by a common vision, regional networks, new research
   facilities and favourable conditions for start-up activities. In this
   case, a new regional ``steering committee{''} facilitated the
   integration and renewal of formerly isolated regional capabilities thus
   demonstrating the potential of a discursive renewal of regional
   innovation systems. (c) 2005 Published by Elsevier B.V.},

Abstract = {Growth of Web-based applications has drawn a great number of diverse
   stakeholders and specialists into the information systems development
   (ISD) practice. Marketing, strategy, and graphic design professionals
   have joined technical developers, business managers, and users in the
   development of Web-based applications. Often, these specialists work for
   different organizations with distinct histories and cultures. A
   longitudinal, qualitative field study of a Web-based application
   development project was undertaken to develop an in-depth understanding
   of the collaborative practices that unfold among diverse professionals
   on ISD projects. The paper proposes that multiparty collaborative
   practice can be understood as constituting a ``collective
   reflection-in-action{''} cycle through which an information systems (IS)
   design emerges as a result of agents producing, sharing, and reflecting
   on explicit objects. Depending on their control over the various
   economic and cultural (intellectual) resources brought to the project
   and developed on the project, agents influence the design in distinctive
   ways. They use this control to either ``add to,{''} ``ignore,{''} or
   ``challenge{''} the work produced by others. Which of these modes of
   collective reflection-in-action are enacted on the project influences
   whose expertise will be reflected in the final design. Implications for
   the study of boundary objects, multiparty collaboration, and
   organizational learning in contemporary ISD are drawn.},

Volume = {51},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Arguing that GAAP is ill suited for estimating the future profitability
   of intangibles, the accounting literature (e.g., Kaplan and Norton 1996,
   Lev 2001) has recently proposed alternative measurement models. These
   models view intangibles as composed of a set of fundamental business
   activities and use multiple financial and nonfinancial metrics causally
   interlinked to profits to represent this view. Using a unique and
   proprietary cross-sectional data set of the retail banking industry, we
   provide some of the first tests on the empirical validity of such
   measurement models. We characterize the core deposit intangible, an
   important retail banking intangible representing a bank's relationships
   with its customers, using financial and nonfinancial metrics on price,
   service, customer usage, and customer satisfaction. We find that the
   metrics do not individually predict future earnings, but gain individual
   significance in a collective setting, increasing the predictive power
   substantially. We argue that this result occurs because the activities
   underlying the measures are causally interlinked to profits and
   explicitly illustrate these linkages with a structural path model. Our
   measurement model also predicts significant interactive effects in the
   way our measures are informative about future profits, and we document
   such effects, not just among the individual measures, but also across
   the measures and environmental factors such as the bank's strategy. In
   sum, our measurement model illustrates the key drivers, measures, and
   interactions in retail banking customer relationships.},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The current study presents the findings of an empirical inquiry into the
   effects of Confucian ethics and collectivism, on individual
   whistleblowing intentions. Confucian Ethics and
   Individualism-Collectivism were measured in a questionnaire completed by
   343 public officials in South Korea. This study found that Confucian
   ethics had significant but mixed effects on whistleblowing intentions.
   The affection between father and son had a negative effect on internal
   and external whistleblowing intentions, while the distinction between
   the roles of husband and wife had a positive effect on those intentions.
   The effects of collectivism were also different depending on the
   specific types of collectivism. Horizontal collectivism had a positive
   effect on both types of whistleblowing intentions, whereas vertical
   collectivism did not show any significant effects on whistleblowing
   intentions. These results indicate that cultural traits such as
   Confucian ethics and collectivism may affect an individual's
   whistleblowing intentions in degree and direction, making blanket
   predictions about cultural effects on whistleblowing difficult.},

Abstract = {The popular success of Malcolm Gladwell's book Blink has refocused
   attention on the perennial issue of intuition versus reason. Rational
   decision making has been the dominant model since at least World War II,
   when the military's need for fast, accurate calculations gave rise to
   new tools for scientific decision making and fueled the rapid expansion
   of computing.
   The spread of computing from government to the workplace led to the
   metaphor of the human brain as computer and the notion that the best
   decisions were driven by brute rationality. (Indeed, as a 12-year-old
   devotee of Popular Electronics in the 1950s, I built a ``decision
   machine{''} with vacuum tubes that promised to enhance any decision.)
   Out of the coupling of society's emphasis on rationality and its growing
   interest in leadership emerged the image of the heroic leader making
   lonely decisions at the top, neither asking for nor receiving any help,
   with rationality as his guide (back then it was always ``his{''}).
   This model, articulated or tacit, remains strong even today. But there
   have always been dissenters who challenged the idea that any one person
   can know enough to make optimal, or even reasonable, complex
   organizational decisions. The twentieth-century economist Friedrich von
   Hayek wrote several stinging critiques along these lines and advised
   that we depend on markets for smart decisions instead. In recent years,
   we have seen numerous examples of how the many, when informed, make
   better decisions than the individual-a concept celebrated by James
   Surowiecki in his book The Wisdom of Crowds. Consider the success of
   ``whisper numbers,'' which often predict companies' future earnings
   better than individual analysts do. And does anyone doubt that
   Hewlett-Packard would be better off if a group of its senior executives
   had made a collective decision about whether to merge with Compaq?
   Cumbersome as that process might have been, the decision probably would
   have been better than the one reached by a single person.
   If collective decisions are often demonstrably better than individual
   ones, why do we embrace the single-person, rational-actor model? I think
   the answer lies in evolutionary psychology. An instinctive faith in the
   reliability of hierarchical leadership is baked into our genes. A
   hundred thousand years ago, it surely made sense for a single leader to
   make command decisions for the group (put another way, cavemen who
   sought consensus as the wolves bore down probably got eaten). Back then,
   consuming lots of fat to stock up for a famine also made sense, as did
   the tendency to band together in tribes and stigmatize, if not kill,
   outsiders. Yet no one would say these measures are sound today, even if
   they're instinctive.
   What worked for our Stone Age forebears doesn't work in the corporation
   today. It's time to acknowledge that it's impossible for any individual
   to make fully informed decisions about running vast entities like large
   firms and nations. Leaders do, of course, have a role to play-inspiring
   the troops, building teams, representing the organization. But when it
   comes to organizational decision making, maybe America's national motto,
   E pluribus unum, can be used to new effect: From many voices, one better
   decision.},

Abstract = {While inter-firm cooperation is expected to pave the way for new
   innovative business opportunities, it has proved to be highly risky and
   difficult. This article analyses the emergence of the Renault-Nissan
   Alliance through the cooperative development of the first joint
   platform. In such collaborations, the relationships are as precarious as
   the potential synergies are uncertain. We argue that the building of a
   new collective identity requires specific managerial models to design
   simultaneously common purposes and collective identity. Several
   managerial implications are derived for inter-firm partnerships that aim
   at exploring new fields. But given the difficulties of managers, the
   paper also discusses possible legal implications and suggests a new type
   of contract, which would actually support the development of exploratory
   partnerships. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {In this essay, I discuss the implications of the debate over offshoring

   business expansion and management strategy to assess which elements of
   these theories may need to be re-specified in light of the offshoring
   phenomenon and which aspects remain relevant. I then present normative
   implications and recommendations for public policy and corporate
   strategy, drawing from emerging insights regarding the global
   responsibilities of corporations. I suggest that international labour
   and environmental standards and corporate codes of conduct could
   mitigate some of the most intense concerns raised about offshoring but
   conclude that offshoring is likely to present challenges to societies,
   corporations, and stakeholders for many decades.},

   personality and that collective personality would be significantly
   related to collective performance. The results supported these
   hypotheses using a sample of franchised units. On the basis of recent

Title = {Improvisation and innovative performance in teams},
Journal = {ORGANIZATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2005},
Volume = {16},
Number = {3},
Pages = {203-224},
Month = {MAY-JUN},
Abstract = {This paper builds on the principles and insights from improvisational
   theater to unpack the nature of collective improvisation and to consider
   what it takes to do it well and to innovate. Furthermore, we discuss the
   role of training in enhancing the incidence and effectiveness of
   improvisation. We propose that two common misconceptions about
   improvisation have hindered managers' understanding of how to develop
   the improvisational skill. First, the spontaneous facet of improvisation
   tends to be overemphasized, and second, there is a general assumption
   that improvisation always leads to positive performance. Our goal is to
   clear up the conceptual confusion about improvisation by laying out the
   various aspects of preparation that are required for effective
   improvisation. In our theoretical model, we delineate how the
   improvisational theater principles of ``practice,{''}
   ``collaboration,{''} ``agree, accept, and add,{''} ``be present in the
   moment,{''} and ``draw on reincorporation and ready-mades{''} can be
   used to understand what it takes to improvise well in work teams and to
   create a context favoring these efforts. Our findings support a
   contingent view of the impact of improvisation on innovative
   performance. Improvisation is not inherently good or bad; however,
   improvisation has a positive effect on team innovation when combined
   with team and contextual moderating factors. We also provide initial
   evidence suggesting that the improvisational skill can be learned by
   organizational members through training. Our results shed light on the
   opportunities provided by training in improvisation and on the
   challenges of creating behavioral change going beyond the individual to
   the team and, ultimately, to the organization.},

Journal = {ORGANIZATION STUDIES},
Year = {2005},
Volume = {26},
Number = {4},
Pages = {547-567},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {The field of organization studies harbors two types of theory of the
   firm: `why' and `how' theories. The former seeks to explain why firms
   exist despite the availability of institutional alternatives, whereas
   the latter explores how firms meaningfully connect the actions of many
   interdependently operating individuals to collective outcomes. Since the
   two approaches are complements rather than substitutes, the field would
   benefit from the development of a parsimonious theory that integrates
   `why' and `how' perspectives. It is argued that Max Weber's writings on
   bureaucracy, and especially his focus on the organization as a
   collective actor governed by rational-legal decision rules, provide a
   meaningful conceptual background structure for such a theory.
   Specifically, through a rational reconstruction of certain elements of
   the Weberian legacy, a neo-Weberian theory of the firm is constructed
   here that simultaneously provides reasons for the existence of the firm
   and explores the nature of cooperation within the firm itself.},

Abstract = {In large-scale negotiation problems and in assessments of complex and
   uncertain environments, it is vital to analyze the different
   stakeholders involved and to evaluate their positions in the
   negotiations. This paper extends a model, which merges previous
   multi-issue and actor-focused methods, based on power relationships
   between stakeholders and their ability to bargain in order to increase
   their utility. The model has already used for assessing a public WLAN
   landscape. The paper emphasizes the dynamic application of the model we
   developed for experimenting the negotiation evolution, shifting
   positions on some issues, and exchanging positions between actors. We
   also claim that such forecasting analyses of negotiation landscapes can

Title = {The influence of interdependent self-construal on procedural fairness
   effects},
Journal = {ORGANIZATIONAL BEHAVIOR AND HUMAN DECISION PROCESSES},
Year = {2005},
Volume = {96},
Number = {2},
Pages = {155-167},

Abstract = {Various theories have been shown to account for the effects of
   procedural fairness on people's attitudes and behaviors. We propose that
   a logical next step for organizational justice researchers is to
   delineate not whether, but rather when certain explanations are likely
   to account for people's reactions to procedural fairness information.
   Accordingly, the present research tested the hypothesis that social
   psychological explanations would be particularly applicable to people
   high in interdependent self-construal. As predicted, the results of
   three studies showed that interdependent self-construal (ISC) moderated
   the relationship between procedural fairness and a variety of dependent
   variables (cooperation, positive affect, and desire for future
   interaction with the other party). In different types of interpersonal
   encounters (social dilemmas, reward allocations, and negotiations),
   procedural fairness had more of an influence on participants' reactions
   among those high rather than low in ISC. Theoretical implications are
   discussed. (c) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Top management teams may be critical for developing organizations that
   can keep abreast of marketplace changes and innovate. Several streams of
   strategy research have argued that conflict and diversity promote top
   management team effectiveness. This study proposes that how top
   management teams manage conflict can greatly contribute to their
   effective leadership of organizational innovation. A total of 378
   executives from 105 organizations in China completed measures of
   conflict management (cooperative, competitive, and avoiding) and
   productive conflict (an outcome of conflict). Separately, 105 CEOs from
   these firms indicated their team's effectiveness and their
   organization's innovativeness. Results support the theory that conflict
   management can contribute to making top management teams effective.
   Structural equation analysis suggests that cooperative conflict
   management promotes productive conflict and top management team
   effectiveness that in turn result in organizational innovation. These
   results, coupled with previous research, were interpreted as suggesting
   that cooperative conflict management is an important contributor to
   effective top management teams even in the collectivist culture of
   China.},

Journal = {REVIEW OF ACCOUNTING STUDIES},
Year = {2005},
Volume = {10},
Number = {1},
Pages = {5-31},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {This paper critically evaluates the use of analysts' forecasts in
   accounting-based valuation. Specifically, I assess the usefulness and
   the limitation of analysts' forecasts in predicting future earnings and
   in explaining the market-to-book ratio, in light of a comprehensive set
   of 22 explicit information items, including: economic rent proxies,
   conservative accounting proxies, earnings quality signals, transitory
   earnings proxies, industry characteristics, and risk and growth proxies.
   While analysts' forecasts capture 45-83\% of the information from these
   sources depending on model specifications, they do not appear to fully
   incorporate certain information items. In particular, proxies for
   conservative accounting and transitory earnings are incrementally useful
   in predicting future earnings; proxies for economic rents, conservative
   accounting, and risk are incrementally useful in explaining the
   market-to-book ratio. Collectively, these results validate the use of
   analysts' forecasts as a parsimonious proxy for forward-looking
   information in accounting-based valuation and suggest how to improve on
   their use.},

Year = {2005},
Volume = {96},

Abstract = {In 1999, Chicago sponsored a public art exhibit of over 300 life-sized
   fiberglass cows that culminated in 140 Internet and live, in-person
   auctions. Collectively, the cows sold for almost seven times their
   initial estimates. These unexpectedly high final prices provided the
   impetus for a model of decision-making, ``competitive arousal,{''} which
   focuses on how diverse factors such as rivalry, social facilitation,
   time pressure, and/or the uniqueness of being first can fuel arousal,
   which then impairs decision-making. In Study 1, live and Internet
   bidding and survey data from 21 auctions throughout North America tested
   the model's predictions, as well as hypotheses derived from rational
   choice and escalation of commitment models. Analyses provided
   considerable support for the competitive arousal and escalation models,
   and no support for rational choice predictions. Study 2 was a laboratory
   experiment that investigated the similarities and differences between
   escalation and competitive arousal, finding again that both can result
   in overbidding. The discussion focuses on the implications of these
   findings and on the broader issue of competitive arousal and escalation
   and their impact on decision-making. (c) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights

   advantage of a broker who can play people off against one another for
   his or her own benefit. Results of a multimethod study of networks and
   innovation in an engineering division of an automotive manufacturer show
   that a tertius iungens orientation, dense social networks, and diverse
   social knowledge predict involvement in innovation. Implications of the

Abstract = {HR portals are complex information technology (IT) applications that can
   be accessed by all employees of a given organization. By placing more
   applications and information online, HR portals reduce the reliance
   employees have on HR personnel. Given this relational change, from human
   to computer, the HR portal implementation process must take into account
   the challenges of both change management and technology acceptance. By
   integrating change management theories with IT user acceptance models,
   this article adds to HR's collective knowledge Of ways to effectively
   implement HR portals. In addition, this article describes the
   cross-national challenges that exist when a global firm attempts to
   implement an HR portal around the world. Thus, this article will present
   a model that (1) integrates change management theories and IT user
   acceptance models and (2) illustrates the ways in which change
   management plans may need to be adapted to be effective in various
   subsidiaries. A case study of Hewlett-Packard's (HP's) worldwide

Abstract = {This essay introduces a new form of social ontology and sketches its
   bearings on the analysis of organizations. The essay begins by
   contrasting the two social ontological camps - individualism and
   societism - into which social theory has been divided since its
   inception. It then describes the new approach, called site ontology,
   according to which social life is tied to a context (site) of which it
   is inherently a part. Examples of such ontologies are presented, as is
   my own thesis that the site of social life is composed of a nexus of
   human practices and material arrangements. The bearing of the latter
   ontology on the character, origin, and perpetuation of organizations is
   then considered, using an academic department as an example. Contrasts
   are also drawn with various approaches in organizations theory,
   including rational organizations, neoinstitutionalism, systems theories,
   and selection theories. A final section considers the complex
   psychological structure of organizations, working off Karl Weick and
   Karlene Robert's notion of collective mind in organizations.},

Abstract = {When a member of an organization has to make a decision or act in a way
   that may benefit some stakeholders at the expense of others, ethical
   dilemmas may arise. This paper examines ethical sensitivity regarding
   the duties to clients and owners (principals), employees (agents), and
   responsibilities to society (third parties). Within this framework,
   ethical perceptions of male and female managers are compared between the
   U.S. and Turkey - two countries that differ on power distance as well as
   the individualism/collectivism dimensions. Our results show that ethical
   sensitivity varies depending upon whether the interests of principals,
   agents, or third parties are affected by a given ethical dilemma. We
   also find that, contingent upon the principal-agent-society
   relationships, the nationality and gender of the decision-maker
   influences ethical sensitivity.},

Title = {Collective efficacy and vigilant problem solving in group decision

Journal = {ORGANIZATIONAL BEHAVIOR AND HUMAN DECISION PROCESSES},
Year = {2005},
Volume = {96},
Number = {2},
Pages = {119-129},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {This research explores the relationship between collective efficacy and
   aspects of analytic or vigilant problem solving (Janis, 1989) in the
   context of group decision making. We hypothesized that vigilant problem
   solving would be most evident under conditions of relatively moderate
   collective efficacy, as opposed to either very high or very low
   collective efficacy. We investigated this hypothesis with groups of
   business students who participated in a complex business strategy
   simulation. Results show a significant curvilinear relationship between
   collective efficacy and vigilant problem solving, and a significant
   linear relationship between vigilant problem solving and decision
   outcomes. There is also evidence that vigilant problem solving mediates
   the relationship between collective efficacy and decision outcomes.
   Implications for theory, managerial practice, and directions for future
   research are discussed. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Electronic networks of practice are computer-mediated discussion forums
   focused on problems of practice that enable individuals to exchange
   advice and ideas with others based on common interests. However, why
   individuals help strangers in these electronic networks is not well
   understood: there is no immediate benefit to the contributor, and
   free-riders are able to acquire the same knowledge as everyone else. To
   understand this paradox, we apply theories of collective action to
   examine how individual motivations and social capital influence
   knowledge contribution in electronic networks. This study reports on the
   activities of one electronic network supporting a professional legal
   association. Using archival, network, survey, and content analysis data,
   we empirically test a model of knowledge contribution. We find that
   people contribute their knowledge when they perceive that it enhances
   their professional reputations, when they have the experience to share,
   and when they are structurally embedded in the network. Surprisingly,
   contributions occur without regard to expectations of reciprocity from
   others or high levels of commitment to the network.},

Abstract = {Qualitative case studies of two Japanese multinational department stores
   in Hong Kong are used to illustrate possible blocking mechanisms and
   collective myopia that hinder Japanese expatriate managers in acquiring
   double-loop organizational learning in their international assignments.
   Four major blocking mechanisms were identified - parent company
   community spirit, dozoku inhabitants, parent company's translators and
   desire for normality. These blocking mechanisms were related to the
   Japanese head office's culture, ideology and desire to control. They
   inhibited the expatriates from challenging established practices,
   procedures and norms, prevented them from becoming knowledgeable human
   agents, and hindered them from forming reflexivity. The expatriates, as
   a result, failed to learn from their international assignments. A
   conceptual model for expatriate learning and blocking mechanisms is
   drawn from the case examples, and implications for improving expatriate
   management to strengthen organizational learning are discussed.},

Abstract = {This article examines the interactive effects of mood and involvement on
   evaluations of product extensions that vary in their similarity to the
   core brand. Results from an initial experiment show that. under
   conditions of high involvement, participants' mood influenced their
   evaluations of extensions that were moderately similar to the core
   brand, but did not affect evaluations of either very similar or
   dissimilar extensions. Under low-involvement conditions, however, the
   influence of positive mood was independent of core brand-extension
   similarity. A second experiment demonstrates that mood's effect on
   extension-evaluations may further depend on the measurement procedures
   used to elicit product appraisals. Collectively, these studies highlight
   important contingencies regarding mood's influence on extension
   evaluations and, as such, improve our understanding of consumers'
   appraisals of brand extensions.},

Pages = {238-249},
Abstract = {This research investigates the extent to which a salesperson's

   salesperson evaluations and purchase intentions. Study I indicates that
   a salesperson's presentation plays an essential role in confirming or
   disconfirming consumer suspicion and that this process has important
   implications in the formation of salesperson attitudes. Evidence from
   Study 2 demonstrates that these interaction effects are mediated by
   persuasion-motive attributions. The findings also support a direct link
   between attitude toward the salesperson and purchase intentions.
   Collectively, these results extend the persuasion literature by
   demonstrating that suspicion of motive is it dynamic state in which
   consumer,, entertain rival hypotheses about the salesperson (e,g., is
   the salesperson truly motivated to help me, or motivated to make his or
   her commission?) and that. depending on the degree of suspicion, the

Title = {Deploying common systems globally: The dynamics of control},
Journal = {INFORMATION SYSTEMS RESEARCH},
Year = {2004},
Volume = {15},
Number = {4},
Pages = {374-395},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {In today's competitive environment, an increasing number of firms are
   building common information systems, which will be deployed globally, to
   support their strategic globalization initiatives. These systems are
   designed to meet the requirements of a diverse set of stakeholders with
   different business needs, priorities, and objectives. One managerial
   tool for addressing and reconciling such differences is control, which
   encompasses all attempts to motivate individuals to act in a manner that
   is consistent with organizational objectives. This paper examines two
   research questions. How do stakeholders exercise control during
   different phases of large IS projects? Why do control choices change
   across project phases? Results of two case studies suggest control is
   exercised differently for each phase. During the initial phase of a
   project, control is exercised as ``collective sensemaking,{''} in which
   both IS and business stakeholders utilize mostly informal mechanisms of
   control. During development, ``technical winnowing{''} of mechanisms
   occurs such that control is vested primarily in IS managers, who
   structure hierarchical relationships with subordinates and who rely
   extensively on formal control mechanisms. Both IS and business
   stakeholders employ formal and informal mechanisms during implementation
   to exercise control as ``collaborative coordinating.{''} The results
   also suggest that changes in control choices from one project phase to
   another are triggered by factors in the project, stakeholder, and global
   contexts. As factors change across phases, so too do control choices.
   Further, problems that surface in one project phase trigger changes to
   controls in subsequent phases. These findings are integrated into a
   model of the dynamics of control. Implications of these results are
   drawn, and directions for future research are suggested.},

Abstract = {The process by which knowledge is created, accumulated and eventually
   destroyed appears crucial to many industrial dynamics patterns, since it
   shapes the profile of evolution of industries by favouring the entry of
   new companies, the co-existence of incumbents and new entrants and,
   eventually, their selective or joint exit over time. Though problematic,
   and all too often neglected, the connection between two nodes of
   interest, Industrial Dynamics on the one hand, and Knowledge Dynamics on
   the other hand, thus appears as a promising field of research. On the
   basis of a case study in the info-communications industry, we start by
   emphasizing that this field of research has direct importance at the
   empirical level. Knowledge dynamics can create specific models of
   evolution among firms at the local level, such as non-shakeout patterns
   within the cluster, which significantly differ from more global patterns
   of evolution in the info-communications industry, now generally oriented
   towards trends of decline and bust. We further argue in favour of the
   development of Knowledge-Based Industrial Dynamics, an approach that
   lies at the interface of industry and knowledge dynamics, and which can
   explain how a cluster may decrease the barriers to knowledge of
   clustered companies and, further, create a specific knowledge dynamics
   that is able to shape the industrial dynamics. Finally, we document how
   this process of knowledge dynamics was collectively implemented in our
   case study on the info-communications cluster and decompose the
   mechanisms that led to a local non-shakeout pattern of industrial
   dynamics. We conclude with some remarks on the policy implications. (C)

Abstract = {Virtual teams cut across national, organizational, and functional
   boundaries, often resulting in diversity in team composition. This paper
   presents the results of a laboratory study involving
   groupware-supported, culturally homogeneous, and heterogeneous virtual
   teams where collaborative conflict management style, a team's cultural
   orientation as measured by the degree of individualism-collectivism, and
   group diversity affect several group performance variables.
   Collaborative conflict management style was positively related to
   performance, group diversity was found to have a moderating influence
   between collaborative style and group performance, and collaborative
   style was influenced by the individualistic-collectivistic orientations.
   Consistent with prior research, we found that collectivistic
   orientations help enhance the level of collaborative conflict management
   style prevailing in teams. Our research also indicates that the process
   to motivate team members may differ depending on their orientation.},

Abstract = {We investigate the regulation of labor markets through employment,

   that the political power of the left is associated with more stringent
   labor regulations and more generous social security systems, and that
   socialist, French, and Scandinavian legal origin countries have sharply
   higher levels of labor regulation than do common law countries. However,
   the effects of legal origins are larger, and explain more of the
   variation in regulations, than those of politics. Heavier regulation of
   labor is associated with lower labor force participation and higher
   unemployment, especially of the young. These results are most naturally
   consistent with legal theories, according to which countries have
   pervasive regulatory styles inherited from the transplantation of legal
   systems.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT STUDIES},
Year = {2004},
Volume = {41},
Number = {7},
Pages = {1105-1129},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Existing strategic group studies have rarely examined ownership type as
   a variable to classify firms in an industry. Using Chinese firms of
   different ownership types, we suggest that ownership type can be a
   parsimonious and important variable that managers use to cognitively
   classify firms into different strategic groups. While ownership itself
   is an objective variable, we contend that different ownership types lead
   to different managerial outlook and mentality due to a number of macro
   and micro foundations giving rise to various managerial cognitions.
   Employing the Miles and Snow typology, we find that state-owned
   enterprises (SOEs) and privately-owned enterprises (POEs) tend to adopt
   defender and prospector strategies, respectively, while
   collectively-owned enterprises (COEs) and foreign-invested enterprises
   (FIEs) exhibit an analyser orientation that falls between defenders and
   prospectors on the strategy continuum. Three statistical tests suggest
   that ownership types can be used to successfully predict strategic group
   memberships in China's emerging economy.},

Abstract = {We draw on complexity theory to explain the emergence of a new

   of the theory at the collective level of analysis. Taking a case study
   approach, we use four dynamics of emergence posited by complexity
   theory's dissipative structures model-fluctuation, positive feedback,
   stabilization. and recombination-to explain how a collective of live
   musical performance theaters in Branson, Missouri, came into being and
   periodically transformed itself over a 100-year period. Our findings
   suggest a strong match between the theoretical perspective employed and
   the empirical processes uncovered, empirically validating the model at
   the collective level. The study demonstrates the value of
   conceptualizing evolution in terms of emergence, highlighting
   distinctions between the nascent complexity approach to evolution and
   the neo-Darwinian evolutionary approach that has dominated the
   theoretical conversation in organization science for the past
   generation. Our findings complement the insights of the dominant
   theoretical perspectives in organization theory, providing a more
   comprehensive understanding of organizational evolution by directly
   addressing the heretofore intractable phenomenon of emergence.},

Abstract = {We provide evidence on the impact of tax incentives and financial
   constraints on corporate R\&D expenditure decisions. We contribute to
   extant research by comparing R\&D expenditures in the United States and
   Canada, thereby exploiting the differences in the two countries' R\&D
   tax credit mechanisms and generally accepted accounting principles. The
   two tax incentive mechanism designs are consistent with differing views
   of the degree of financial constraints faced by firms in these
   economies. Our sample also allows us to explore the effects of
   capitalizing R\&D on Canadian firms. Employing a matched design, we
   document relations between tax credit incentives and R\&D spending
   consistent with both Canadian and U.S. public companies responding as
   though they are not financially constrained. We estimate that the
   Canadian credit system induces, on average, \$1.30 of additional R\&D
   spending per dollar of taxes forgone while the U.S. system induces, on
   average, \$2.96 of additional spending. We also find that firms that
   capitalize R\&D costs in Canada spend, on average, 18 percent more on
   R\&D. Collectively, this evidence is important to the ongoing debates in
   both countries concerning the appropriate design of incentives for R\&D
   and is consistent with the assumptions found in the U.S. tax credit
   system, but not those found in the Canadian system.},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Exploring the concept of citizenship from the history of political
   philosophy provides suggestions about what corporate citizenship could
   mean. The metaphor of corporate citizenship suggests an institutional
   approach to corporate social responsibility. Citizenship is a social
   role, characterized by an orientation towards the social contract,
   collective and active responsibility, as well as a positive attitude
   towards the juridical state. By analogy, corporate citizenship is a
   social role, characterized by the social contract of business, a
   participatory ethics of business, the precautionary principle and the
   promotion of just international institutions. It is considered that
   corporate citizenship depends on a number of interacting institutional
   conditions that hold society partly responsible for the social
   performance of their companies. Finally, the problem of the dissolution
   of corporate social responsibility is reviewed in an institutional
   environment where everyone is considered responsible.},

   GLOBE's cultural values (in-group collectivism, uncertainty avoidance,
   and future orientation) were selected to investigate their direct
   effects on the rated effectiveness of influence strategies, and their
   possible interaction with dimensions of individual beliefs. Results
   showed that different dimensions of individual social beliefs predict
   the perceived effectiveness of the three types of influence strategy,

Abstract = {Aggregate real dividends paid by industrial firms increased over the
   past two decades even though, as Fama and French (J. Financial Econ. 60,
   3) (2001 a) document, the number of dividend payers decreased by over
   50\%. The reason is that (i) the reduction in payers occurs almost
   entirely among firms that paid very small dividends, and (ii) increased
   real dividends from the top payers swamp the modest dividend reduction
   from the loss of many small payers. These trends reflect high and
   increasing concentration in the supply of dividends which, in turn,
   reflects high and increasing earnings concentration. For example, the 25
   firms that paid the largest dividends in 2000 account for a majority of
   the aggregate dividends and earnings of industrial firms. Industrial
   firms exhibit a two-tier structure in which a small number of firms with
   very high earnings collectively generates the majority of earnings and
   dominates the dividend supply, while the vast majority of firms has at
   best a modest collective impact on aggregate earnings and dividends. (C)

   material and investment prospectuses issued by socially responsible
   mutual funds (SRI funds) commonly contain the claim that, by affecting
   corporations' access to capital funding, SRI funds can change corporate
   practices. This paper makes a contribution by presenting the market
   share of SRI funds in the regions where they are most developed, being
   Europe, the U.S. and Australia, to show that this claim is unlikely to
   eventuate. SRI funds also commonly claim that they will outperform
   conventional active mutual funds. That the economic performances of both
   are similar might be explained by their similar portfolio compositions.
   The paper makes an innovation in the SRI literature by adopting a
   legitimacy framework to explain the continued presence of SRI funds. To
   achieve desired social and environmental outcomes, SRI funds are urged
   to address issues at a more systemic level. A suggested mechanism is the
   collective lobbying of corporations and, especially, governments.},

Abstract = {We provide a new and more complete analysis of the origins of the Dust
   Bowl of the 1930s, one of the most severe environmental crises in North
   America in the twentieth century. Severe drought and wind erosion hit
   the Great Plains in 1930 and lasted through 1940. There were similar
   droughts in the 1950s and 1970s, but no comparable level of wind
   erosion. We explain why. The prevalence of small farms in the 1930s
   limited private solutions for controlling the downwind externalities
   associated with wind erosion. Drifting sand from unprotected fields
   damaged neighboring farms. Small farmers cultivated more of their land
   and were less likely to invest in erosion control than larger farmers.
   Soil conservation districts, established by the government after 1937,
   helped coordinate erosion control. This ``unitized{''} solution for
   collective action is similar to that used in other natural
   resource/environmental settings.},

Abstract = {Online spaces that enable shared public interpersonal communications are
   of significant social, organizational, and economic importance. In this
   paper, a theoretical model and associated unobtrusive method are
   proposed for researching the relationship between online spaces and the
   behavior they host. The model focuses on the collective impact that
   individual information-overload coping strategies have on the dynamics
   of open, interactive public online group discourse. Empirical research
   was undertaken to assess the validity of both the method and the model,
   based on the analysis of over 2.65 million postings to 600 Usenet
   newsgroups over a 6-month period. Our findings support the assertion
   that individual strategies for coping with ``information overload{''}
   have an observable impact on large-scale online group discourse.
   Evidence was found for the hypotheses that: (1) users are more likely to
   respond to simpler messages in overloaded mass interaction; (2) users
   are more likely to end active participation as the overloading of mass
   interaction increases; and (3) users are more likely to generate simpler
   responses as the overloading of mass interaction grows.
   The theoretical model outlined offers insight into aspects of
   computer-mediated communication tool usability, technology design, and
   provides a road map for future empirical research.},

Volume = {82},
Number = {6},
Pages = {119+},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {By making the most of organizational capabilities-employees' collective
   skills and fields of expertise-you can dramatically improve your
   company's market value. Although there is no magic list of proficiencies
   that every organization needs in order to succeed, the authors identify
   11 intangible assets that well-managed companies tend to have: talent,
   speed, shared mind-set and coherent brand identity, accountability,
   collaboration, learning, leadership, customer connectivity, strategic
   unity, innovation, and efficiency. Such companies typically excel in
   only three of these capabilities while maintaining industry parity in
   the other areas. Organizations that fall below the norm in any of the 11
   are likely candidates for dysfunction and competitive disadvantage.
   So you can determine how your company fares in these categories (or
   others, if the generic list doesn't suit your needs), the authors
   explain how to conduct a ``capabilities audit,{''} describing in
   particular the experiences and findings of two companies that recently
   performed such audits. In addition to highlighting which intangible
   assets are most important given the organization's history and strategy,
   this exercise will gauge how well your company delivers on its
   capabilities and will guide you in developing an action plan for
   improvement.
   A capabilities audit can work for an entire organization, a business
   unit, or a region-indeed, for any part of a company that has a strategy
   to generate financial or customer-related results. It enables executives
   to assess overall company strengths and weaknesses, senior leaders to
   define strategy, midlevel managers to execute strategy, and frontline
   leaders to achieve tactical results. In short, it helps turn intangible
   assets into concrete strengths.},

Abstract = {We investigate corporate transparency, defined as the availability of

   conceptualize corporate transparency within a country as output front a
   multifaceted system whose components collectively produce, gather,
   validate, and disseminate information. We factor analyze a range of
   measures capturing countries' firm specific information environments,
   isolating two distinct factors. The first factor, interpreted as
   financial transparency, captures the intensity and timeliness of
   financial disclosures, and their interpretation and dissemination by
   analysts and the media. The second factor, interpreted as governance
   transparency, captures the intensity of governance disclosures used by
   outside investors to hold officers and directors accountable. We
   investigate whether these factors vary with countries' legal/judicial
   regimes and political economies. Our main multivariate result is that
   the governance transparency factor is primarily related to a country's
   legal/judicial regime, whereas the financial transparency factor is
   primarily related to political economy.},

Abstract = {One of the most significant developments in the latter part of the 20th
   century and the first part of this new millennium has been the triumph
   of short-term over long-term thinking. We are increasingly a culture
   that looks neither to the past nor to the future, but only to the next
   ``quarter,'' or to the next Delphic pronouncement by Alan Greenspan.
   This cultural construction of time has given rise to social, political
   and personal problems of unprecedented magnitude. The short-term focus
   of contemporary American capitalism is causing us to behave, both
   individually and collectively, in an increasingly irrational and thus
   self-destructive manner. Ours is now the most violent, crime-ridden
   society in the industrialized world. Capitalism is sometimes blamed for
   this, yet there are other capitalist societies that do not suffer the
   same evils we suffer. I argue that we can learn from these societies how
   to correct some of the ills of our own system and in this way construct
   a new paradigm of the market, a paradigm for the new millennium, a more
   mature, rational version of capitalism that would focus on the long
   rather than the short term.},

Note = {9th Annual International Conference on Promoting Business Ethics, St
   John Univ, Niagara Fall, NY, 2001},
Abstract = {Proponents of the dominant contemporary model of corporate governance
   maintain that the shareholder is the primary constituent of the firm.
   The responsibility for managerial decision makers in this governance
   system is to maximize shareholder wealth. Neoclassical economists
   ethically justify this objective with their interpretation of Adam
   Smith's notion of the Invisible Hand. Using a famous quotation from The
   Wealth of Nations, they interpret the Invisible Hand as Smith's ( An
   Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations, Methuen \&
   Co., London) assertion that market participants, in pursuing their own
   self-interests without regard to the interests of others, will
   collectively provide the optimal economic benefit to society. We argue
   that the traditional interpretation of Smith is too narrow and
   potentially harmful to society. In order to fully understand Smith's
   notion of the influence of the Invisible Hand on human behavior, one
   must also consider The Theory of Moral Sentiments. In that work, Smith (
   The Theory of Moral Sentiments, A. Millar, London) portrays the pursuit
   of self-interest as only one of several potential motivations for human
   action. He also acknowledged the existence of a ``sympathy principle,''
   which refers to the ability and propensity of human beings to consider
   the interests of others. Heilbroner ( The Essential Adam Smith, W. W.
   Norton, New York, p. 59) suggests that Smith's sympathy principle allows
   one to ``determine the appropriate degree of self-interest, the proper
   display of benevolence, the desirable strictness of justice.'' In fact,
   Smith indicates that ( 1) a society whose members pursue self-interest
   without a sense of justice will eventually collapse; ( 2) a society
   whose members pursue self-interest checked by their sense of justice
   alone will survive; ( 3) a society whose members pursue self-interest,
   justice, and the interests of others will flourish. Since a more
   complete reading of Smith indicates that human beings, in considering
   their own interests, also reflexively consider the interests of others
   when making decisions, then the traditional corporate governance model
   appears to be lacking. A broader, multiple stakeholder approach to
   corporate governance that considers the interests of other
   constituencies may be more consistent with Smith's views. In particular,
   Smith's sympathy principle provides a theoretical foundation for a shift
   away from the narrow, yet dominant, shareholder-based corporate
   governance model and toward multiple stakeholder models of corporate
   governance {[} e. g., Business and Society: A Strategic Approach to
   Corporate Citizenship, Houghton Mifflin, Boston, MA] and internal
   decision-making {[}e.g., Sloan Management Review 38, ( 1997) 25 37].},

   they were far too optimistic about the speed with which the revolution
   would occur. Now, as the bitter disillusionment of the dot-com bust
   begins to fade, we have a chance to think again-this time more
   rationally- about how best to take advantage of the remarkable change,
   these new technologies are gradually making possible.
   One such change is the ability to create markets inside companies,
   allowing decision making to be decentralized and introducing some of the
   efficiency, flexibility, and motivating influence of free markets. in
   this article, the author examines this nascent form of business
   organization, exploring the benefits as well as the potential risks. BP,
   for, example, met its goal of reducing the company's greenhouse gas
   emissions nine years ahead of schedule, not by setting and enforcing
   targets for each division but by allowing business unit heads to buy and
   sell emissions permits among themselves using an electronic trading
   system. And Hewlett-Packard recently experimented with a system that
   allowed employees to buy and sell predictions about likely printer
   sales, using a kind of futures contract. The markets ended up predicting
   the actual printer sales with much more accuracy than official HP
   forecasts.
   At a fundamental level, these changes are enabled by the fact that
   electronic technologies allow information to be widely shared at little
   cost. This simple fact has a profound implication for organizing
   businesses. When more people have more information, they can use it to
   make their own well-informed decisions, appropriate to local
   circumstances, instead of following orders from above. As a result, even
   very large companies can benefit from the collective wisdom of their
   employees.},

Abstract = {Taking a procedural justice perspective, we examined the effect of
   guanxi practices in human resources management (i.e., making human

   on employees' trust in management in Chinese organizations. Two studies

   of guanxi practices on trust in management, which was mediated by
   perceived procedural justice. In the second, an experimental study, we
   found that the negative effect of guanxi practices varied as a function
   of guanxi bases: favoring a nephew or a hometown fellow lowered trust,
   but favoring a college schoolmate or a close friend did not. Theoretical
   and practical implications are discussed.},

Abstract = {In recent years, Western scholars have increasingly emphasized the
   importance of organizational citizenship behavior (OCB)-employees'
   behavior and actions that are not specifically designated in their
   formal job duties. Almost the entire body of empirical research on OCB
   is based on studies conducted in the United States, using U.S. employee
   populations as samples. Taking an inductive approach, we examined forms
   of OCB in the People's Republic of China (China). From a diverse sample
   of 158 employees and managers in 72 state-owned, collective, town and
   village, foreign-invested, and private enterprises in China, we
   collected 726 OCB incidents or items that were commonly observed in the
   workplace. We then subjected these to a content analysis to identify
   major forms of OCB. Results of our analysis revealed 10 dimensions of
   OCB, with at least one dimension not evident at all in the Western
   literature, and four that do not figure importantly in established OCB
   measures. The type of organizations influenced the reporting of several
   forms of OCB. Results suggested that Chinese formulation of OCB differs
   from that in the West, and is embedded in its unique social and cultural
   context. We discuss these results in terms of their implications for
   future research in OCB.},

Abstract = {The ownership restructuring of Chinese state-owned enterprises, launched
   in 1992, has been one of the most radical and far-reaching
   market-oriented reforms in the Chinese economy. We studied the effects
   of ownership reform and individuals' collectivist values on
   rewards-allocation preferences of employees in Chinese state-owned
   enterprises, and how these relationships were mediated by employees'
   productivity goal orientation. We predicted the effects of ownership
   reform and collectivism on rewards-allocation preferences based on the
   model of allocation goal priority and the conceptual distinctions of
   vertical and horizontal collectivism. With data from four pairs of
   public state-owned enterprises (i.e., listed on the stock market) versus
   pure state-owned enterprises, we found the following results. First,
   employees of enterprises that had experienced a greater degree of
   ownership reform expressed stronger preferences for differential
   allocation rules (e.g., job position and performance) but weaker
   preferences for equalitarian allocation rules (e.g., group and
   individual equality). Second, vertical collectivism was positively
   related to preferences for differential allocation rules, but horizontal
   collectivism was positively related to preferences for equalitarian
   allocation rules. Third, the effects of both ownership reform and
   vertical collectivism on differential allocation preferences were
   mediated by productivity goal orientation. Research and practical
   implications for ownership reform and vertical-horizontal collectivism
   are discussed.},

Journal = {HARVARD BUSINESS REVIEW},
Year = {2004},
Volume = {82},
Number = {2},
Pages = {82+},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Too many organizations descend into underperformance because they can't
   confront the painful gap between their strategy and the reality of their
   capabilities, their behaviors, and their markets. That's because senior
   managers don't know how to engage in truthful conversations about the
   problems that threaten the business-and because lower-level managers are
   afraid to speak up. These factors lie behind many failures to implement
   strategy. Indeed, the dynamics in almost any organization are such that
   it's extremely difficult for senior people to hear the unfiltered truth
   from managers lower down.
   Beer and Eisenstat present the methodology they've developed for getting
   the truth about an organization's problems (and the truth is always
   embedded within the organization) onto the table in a way that allows
   senior management to do something useful with it. By assembling a task
   force of the most effective managers to collect data about strategic and
   organizational problems, the senior team sends a clear message that it
   is serious about uncovering the truth. Task force members present their
   findings to the senior team in the form of a discussion. This
   conversation needs to move back and forth between advocacy and inquiry;
   it has to be about the issues that matter most; it has to be collective
   and public; it has to allow employees to be honest without risking their
   jobs; and it has to be structured. This direct feedback from a handful
   of their best people moves senior teams to make changes they otherwise
   might not have.
   Senior teams that have engaged in this process have made dramatic
   changes in how their businesses are organized and managed-and in their
   bottom-line results. Success that begins with honest conversations
   begets future conversations that further improve performance.},

Abstract = {Group brainstorming is usually considered a task of divergent thinking,
   and the ideas produced in most research on brainstorming are counted and
   scored for creativity but put to no further use. We studied
   brainstorming by embedding it in a rule induction task that initially
   requires divergent thinking but increasingly requires convergent
   thinking as evidence accumulates across trials. We also tested whether
   brainstorming facilitated performance on the induction task itself. The
   experimental design was a 2 (nominal or interacting groups) x 3
   (brainstorming early in the task, late in the task, or none) factorial.
   For brainstorming performance, nominal groups of 4 individuals
   outperformed face-to-face groups of 4 individuals. But as predicted from
   an analysis of the effects of constraining hypotheses by evidence, the
   advantage for nominal groups declined when brainstorming took place late
   in the task where there was a large amount of accumulated evidence to
   consider. Brainstorming did not generally affect performance on the
   induction task, although early group brainstorming resulted in more
   correct hypotheses than late group brainstorming. Group brainstorming
   was perceived as more effective than individual brainstorming by both
   interacting and nominal group members, a finding that extends the
   illusion of group productivity in brainstorming to tasks of convergent
   thinking. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2004},
Volume = {30},
Number = {1},
Pages = {71-96},
Abstract = {Two experiments tested the effects of organizational identification on
   individual decisions to cooperate. These decisions occurred in the
   context of a nested social dilemma in which individuals, subgroups, and
   the larger collective each held distinct and incompatible interests. In
   Study 1, when the two subgroups in the dilemma were from different real
   organizations, higher organizational identification caused lower
   cooperation with the collective (and higher cooperation with the
   subgroup) when the opposing organization had a purportedly
   individualistic culture and reputation. The results of Study 2 supported
   this interpretation by showing that organizational identification had a
   negative effect on collective cooperation, and a corresponding positive
   effect on subgroup cooperation, when decision makers perceived the
   opposing department to have an individualistic reputation. I discuss the
   implications of these results for organizations that try to elicit
   cooperation by fostering members' organizational identification. (C)

Title = {Managers and leaders - Are they different?},
Journal = {HARVARD BUSINESS REVIEW},
Year = {2004},
Volume = {82},
Number = {1},
Pages = {74+},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Managers and leaders are two very different types of people. Managers'
   goals arise out of necessities rather than desires; they excel at
   defusing conflicts between individuals or departments, placating all
   sides while ensuring that an organization's day-to-day business gets
   done. Leaders, on the other hand, adopt personal, active attitudes
   toward goals. They look for the opportunities and rewards that lie
   around the corner, inspiring subordinates and firing up the creative
   process with their own energy. Their relationships with employees and
   coworkers are intense, and their working environment is often chaotic.
   In this article, first published in 1977, the author argues that
   businesses need both managers and leaders to survive and succeed. But in
   the larger U.S. organizations of that time, a ``managerial mystique{''}
   seemed to perpetuate the development of managerial personalities-people
   who rely on, and strive to maintain, orderly work patterns. The
   managerial power ethic favors collective leadership and seeks to avoid
   risk.
   That same managerial mystique can stifle leaders' development-How can an
   entrepreneurial spirit develop when it is submerged in a conservative
   environment and denied personal attention? Mentor relationships are
   crucial to the development of leadership personalities, but in large,
   bureaucratic organizations, such relationships are not encouraged.
   Businesses must find ways to train good managers and develop leaders at
   the same time. Without a solid organizational framework, even leaders
   with the most brilliant ideas may spin their wheels, frustrating
   coworkers and accomplishing little. But without the entrepreneurial
   culture that develops when a leader is at the helm of an organization, a

Abstract = {This study examines quotations, order routing, and trade execution costs
   for seven markets that compete for orders in large-capitalization
   NYSE-listed stocks. The competitiveness of quote updates from each
   market varies with measures of the profitability of attracting
   additional order and with volatility and inventory measures. The
   probability of a trade executing on each market increases when the
   market posts competitive quotes. Execution costs for non-NYSE trades
   when the local market posts competitive (non-competitive) quotes are
   virtually the same (substantially exceed) costs for matched NYSE trades.
   Collectively, these results imply a significant degree of quote-based
   competition for order flow and are consistent with off-NYSE liquidity
   providers using competitive quotations to signal when they are prepared
   to give better-than-normal trade executions. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {Researchers have emphasized that existing training strategies must be
   modified in order to adequately prepare users to employ collaborative
   applications. We utilize findings from the vast amount of training
   research conducted thus far and point to some problems that might occur
   when existing strategies are applied to train users of collaborative
   applications. We test our ideas by conducting a longitudinal field study
   of a collaborative work flow application. As proposed in a recent
   knowledge-level framework, our findings indicate that training programs
   must not solely focus on developing users' system proficiency skills but
   must also educate users about the business processes that the
   collaborative application will support. This additional knowledge will
   enable users to deal with technology-induced changes in the business
   processes due to the deployment of the collaborative application.
   Furthermore, we find that training programs should sensitize users to
   the interdependencies that exist among their tasks and make them aware
   of the collective consequences of their individual actions. We also
   found that users have to engage in collective problem solving efforts
   and continuously learn new knowledge during the process of appropriation
   of the collaborative application. We propose a training framework that
   integrates these ideas to prepare users to make effective use of
   collaborative applications. The proposed framework calls for trainers to
   be continuously engaged with users and help refine their knowledge
   during the process of appropriation. We suggest that theoretical
   foundations rooted in collective learning be adopted to guide training
   research in collaborative applications.},

Abstract = {In this article, we use the implementation of an expert system to
   improve blast furnace control in the French steel industry to illustrate
   the problem of knowledge articulation/codification. Blast furnace
   related knowledge still largely takes the form of empirical know-how in
   general and expert know-how tied to specific individuals in particular.
   Therefore, the articulation/codification of knowledge in this field is a
   difficult task requiring the identification and selection of `best
   practices' for the purpose of codification. This process, in turn,
   affects daily routines and creates new forms of generic knowledge that
   make use of local knowledge. These new forms of generic information
   reinforce the tendency to appropriate private knowledge currently
   prevailing in Usinor, a large French steel company, and create new
   routes and new insights for RD policy. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

Abstract = {This article engages in debates stimulated by previous work published in
   Organization Studies, and more widely, on the purpose and effects of
   workers' humour and joking practices. The authors emphasize the
   subversive character of humour in the workplace, rejecting perspectives
   which see humour as inevitably contributing to organizational harmony.
   Drawing on methodologies, including ethnography, which permitted the
   authors to penetrate the organizational surface of two call centres,
   rich evidence of satire and joking practices were uncovered. While
   long-acknowledged motives were revealed, particularly relief from
   boredom and routine, workers' use of humour took novel, call centre
   specific forms. Overwhelmingly, though, humour contributed to the
   development of vigorous countercultures in both locations, which
   conflicted with corporate aims and priorities. However, the particular
   combinations of managerial culture, attitudes to trade unionism and
   dissent, and the nature of oppositional groupings helped impart a
   different character to humour between the two call centres. At Excell,
   the presence of a group of activists seeking to build workplace trade
   unionism in circumstances of employer hostility was a crucial contrast.
   These activists were instrumental in their use of humour, aware that it
   helped make the union popular and served to weaken managerial authority.
   This evidence, that subversive satire can be allied to a wider
   collective union organizing campaign at workplace level, makes a
   distinctive contribution to the recent literature on organizational
   humour.},

Abstract = {In order to describe the functioning of business firms, two different
   models of collective action are currently mobilized. The first
   represents the firm as an arena for the different strategies of actors
   who want to maximize their interests. The second model focuses on the
   existence of shared values, of a common culture. In order to contribute
   to synthesis between these two approaches, two opposite situations are
   compared: the running of a firm in Morocco, which appears to be a
   community-like enterprise, and the running of a firm in the USA, where
   on the contrary, the community elements seem to be markedly absent. We
   analyze how the strategies of actors are combined with a collective
   adherence to a moral community. This enables us to propose a theoretical
   approach combining these two facets of the firms' functioning. In the
   two cases, we have found a common perception of the good and the bad
   which enables us to talk about a moral community.},

   learned more when composed of individuals who were high in cognitive
   ability and when the workload was distributed evenly. Conversely, team
   learning was negatively affected when teams were composed of individuals
   who were high in Agreeableness. Finally, teams using a paired structure
   learned more than teams structured either functionally or divisionally.

Journal = {ORGANIZATION STUDIES},
Year = {2003},
Volume = {24},
Number = {8},
Pages = {1219-1229},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {How does social science based organization theory describe the business
   firm? Sociology, political science, social psychology and ethnology have
   inspired two almost classical perspectives. One theorizes the firm as an
   arena for strategic behavior. The other underlines the way social
   pressure mechanisms structure a moral community dimension. Two
   additional approaches exist, less explored. The firm can be defined as a
   collective actor, the agenda for knowledge being to explain how far
   collective choice is possible. Or the firm may be studied from a
   cognitive perspective, as an organization which interprets and thinks.
   The article argues that organization theory offers a unitary if not
   limited view of the business firm. Social sciences basically debate
   around two alternative views which differentiate according to four
   characteristics: the action arena or the context of behavior; the
   teleological property of the unit; the payoff matrix or the sources of
   preferences with which members enter collective choice contexts; and the
   sources of managerial influence.},

Title = {A theory of the cultural evolution of the firm: The intra-organizational
   ecology of memes},
Journal = {ORGANIZATION STUDIES},
Year = {2003},
Volume = {24},
Number = {8},
Pages = {1309-1352},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {In this article, we propose a theory of the cultural evolution of the
   firm. We apply cultural and evolutionary thinking to the questions posed
   by theories of the firm: What are firms and why do they exist? We argue
   that firms are best thought of as cultures, as social distributions of
   modes of thought and forms of externalization. Using the term `meme' to
   refer collectively to cultural modes of thought (ideas, beliefs,
   assumptions, values, interpretative schema, and know-how), we describe
   culture as a social phenomenon, patterns of symbolic communication and
   behavior that are produced as members of the group enact the memes they
   have acquired as part of the culture. Memes spread from mind to mind as
   they are enacted and the resulting cultural patterns are observed and
   interpreted by others. The uncertainties of interpretation and the
   possibilities of reinterpretation and recontextualization create
   variation in the memes as they spread. Over time, firms evolve as a
   process of the selection, variation, and retention of memes. Our claim
   is that understanding firms in this way provides a new perspective (what
   we call the `meme's-eye view') on the question of why we have the firms

Abstract = {Drawing on our work in two postsocialist countries, Hungary and Romania,
   we contribute to understanding product involvement and brand commitment.
   We demonstrate that prominent political-cultural discourses, cultural
   intermediaries, social influences, and life themes and projects
   collectively prompt product involvement. We introduce the concept of
   involvement with branded products and examine its origins within a
   sociohistorical context. We consider the origins of brand commitment and
   illustrate that consumers with little interest in either the product
   category or the idea of branded products may be committed to particular
   brands. Further, we contribute to understanding the relationships among
   product involvement, brand commitment, and brand experimentation.},

Title = {Cross-cultural variations in leadership perceptions and attribution of
   charisma to the leader},
Journal = {ORGANIZATIONAL BEHAVIOR AND HUMAN DECISION PROCESSES},
Year = {2003},
Volume = {92},
Number = {1-2},
Pages = {52-66},
Month = {SEP-NOV},
Abstract = {Leadership perception is based on (a) a recognition-based process that
   involves categorization of leaders' characteristics into relevant
   stereotypes; and (b) an inference-based process that involves making
   attributions for leaders' characteristics based on outcomes of salient
   events (Lord \& Maher, 1993). The present study examined the interactive
   effects of these two alternative processes of leadership perceptions on
   attributions of charisma cross-culturally. Groups of participants from
   either a collectivistic culture (Turkey) or an individualistic culture
   (United States) read a vignette about a prototypical or antiprototypical
   leader (manipulation of recognition-based process) whose company
   produced a slight or significant increase in sales (manipulation of
   inference-based process). The results showed that the co-occurrence of
   these two processes produced optimal attribution of charisma to the
   leader. In addition, the leaders' prototypical characteristics were more
   effective in forming a leadership impression in an individualistic
   culture, whereas collectivistic people made attributions based on the
   company performance outcome. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science (USA). All rights

Abstract = {A boycott is never far from a firm's exchanges with its customers.
   Researchers in marketing need to understand consumer protest behavior,
   both to aid nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) who wish to organize
   boycotts, and to assist managers who wish to develop appropriate
   strategic responses. Boycotts, like many other instances of collective
   action, are subject to free-rider and small-agent problems: there
   appears to be little or no motivation for an individual to participate.
   Yet they assuredly occur. We take an economic and psychological approach
   to the study of boycotts. Our approach is to develop a typology of
   motivations for consumer boycotts, to embed these motivations explicitly
   in a dynamic economic model, and thus to offer explanations for the
   extent of boycott participation.},

   findings concerning how this team responded to the unexpected in its

   presence; creating a context for a shared and emotionally grounded
   identity; and developing a shared set of guiding principles for action,
   behaviour, and decision-making. The authors further describe
   interconnections among these three core findings, proposing a
   higher-level `virtuous circle' that illustrates how this team responded
   effectively to critical incidents.},

Abstract = {The research system is highly dependent upon the resources provided by
   the political system. Rising costs of research projects and the
   emergence of financial problems in government have triggered a reduction
   in direct support to public research organisations (PROs). The aim of
   this paper is to analyse how a group of Spanish public research
   organisations affected by the reduction in direct transfers of State
   funds have reacted to this situation. By reviewing the PROs' responses,
   an institutionalist argument is built up based on the degree and type of
   autonomy which the centres and researchers enjoy. Factors which explain
   the diversity in response of the centres in their funding strategies
   are: (a) the political autonomy of the PROs with respect to their
   tutelary ministries, and (b) the autonomy of the researchers within the
   organisation, the nature of the individual incentive programmes and
   their level of dependence on collective resources. (C) 2002 Elsevier

Abstract = {Managers are often urged to rise above daily demands and look at the big
   picture. In this article, noted photographer Yarn Arthus-Bertrand and
   renowned business commentator Charles Handy have, literally, done just
   that.
   Since 1990, Yann Arthus-Bertrand has taken thousands of aerial
   photographs in nearly go countries, compiling a detailed portrait of the
   Earth from above. He calls these images invitations-to reflect upon the
   evolution of the planet and its people, to realize that individually and
   collectively we will determine the kind of world we will pass on to
   future generations. The photos, most of them taken from a helicopter,
   depict a variety of natural habitats and human lifestyles as well as the
   impact modern civilization can have on them. To provide a complement to
   Arthus-Bertrand's work, HBR asked Charles Handy-author of The Elephant
   and the Flea: Reflections of a Reluctant Capitalist and numerous other
   books-to reflect on six of the photos and what they suggest about the
   role of business in a changing world.
   While Handy did not accompany the photographer on his aerial voyages,
   his meditations take a similarly lofty perspective on some of the
   important business and social issues of our time.
   In one essay, he talks about finding a way to make wealth trickle
   upward-turning the bottom 20\% of a developing country's earners into
   creators of net wealth. In another, he describes the good and bad
   outcomes that occur when a country relies heavily on tourist dollars for
   its GDP Handy also comments on the emerging personal-services economy;
   examines the wine-making industry; paints a picture of the corporation
   as community; and points out that, despite the detritus left in its
   wake, industrialization has not been all bad.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ETHICS},
Year = {2003},
Volume = {46},
Number = {2},
Pages = {143-150},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {There is a clear tendency in contemporary political/legal thought to
   limit agency to individual agents, thereby denying the existence and
   relevance of collective moral agency in general, and corporate agency in
   particular. This tendency is ultimately rooted in two particular forms
   of individualism - methodological and fictive (abstract) - which have
   their source in the Enlightenment. Furthermore, the dominant notion of
   moral agency owes a lot to Kant whose moral/legal philosophy is grounded
   exclusively on abstract reason and personal autonomy, to the detriment
   of a due recognition of the socio-historical grounds of moral social
   conduct.
   I shall argue that an adequate theory of responsibility is needed, which
   does not only take into account individual responsibility, but also
   collective and corporate responsibility, capable of taking into
   consideration society and its problems. Furthermore, corporations are
   consciously and carefully structured organisations with different levels
   of management and have clearly defined aims and objectives, a central
   feature upon which I shall be focussing in this paper.},

Abstract = {This research studied the influence of acculturation on the values of
   Hispanic MBAs in the USA and the effect these values have on job
   attribute preferences. As predicted, the less acculturated Hispanic MBAs
   had significantly higher collectivist values than either highly
   acculturated Hispanic or Anglo-American MBAs. Surprisingly,
   acculturation was not related to individualism. As theorized,
   collectivistic, and not individualistic, values were significantly.
   related to a preference for contextual job attributes. In contrast,
   individualistic, and not collectivistic, values were related to a
   preference for task-related job attributes. The findings point to the
   importance of understanding an individual's level of acculturation and
   his/her specific values, rather than assuming differences based on
   ethnicity. In addition, the findings indicate that managers dealing with
   diversity within the USA or globally must understand their employees'
   individualistic/collectivistic values before implementing any job design
   initiatives.},

Abstract = {This article presents an analysis of institutional influences upon
   knowledge creation within professional service firms, whose main
   business is the provision of specialized consultancy. Such firms, we
   argue, provide an important setting for examining such influences
   because their survival depends on their ability to mobilize and
   synthesize professional bodies of knowledge. They, therefore, directly
   confront the constraints that institutionalized professions pose for
   processes of knowledge creation. By exploring the influence of the
   institutional context, the article extends earlier work on professional
   service and knowledge-intensive firms which has tended to adopt a more
   micro, organizational-level focus on knowledge creation and to neglect
   both the heterogeneous nature of knowledge and its embeddedness in
   institutional contexts.
   A comparative analysis of two firms located in different institutional
   contexts (science and the law) establishes some of the major mechanisms
   through which professional institutions influence knowledge-creation
   processes. Specifically, the analysis highlights three major arenas,
   related to the processes of knowledge creation within organizations, in
   which institutional influences are seen to operate. These are: the
   relative work autonomy of professional groups; the means of knowledge
   legitimation; and the social identity formation of professional
   practitioners. While institutional influences were found in these
   different arenas across both cases, significant differences in
   knowledge-creating practices were also observed. These include different
   emphases on experimentation versus interpretation, different forms of
   personal networking, and significant differences in the relative
   importance of codifying knowledge in documentary forms. These
   differences are explained in terms of institutionally embedded means of
   legitimating knowledge across scientific and legal contexts.
   In observing institutional influences on micro work practices, however,
   our study also highlights the role and influence of management.
   Specifically, in the arena of social identity, managers sought to
   accommodate professional norms through firm-specific arrangements, which
   shaped and mobilized a social identity geared toward corporate ends.
   Management effort thus focused on developing a collective identity,
   based on elitism, which was used as a means of leveraging individual
   creativity and expertise as an organizational resource.},

   a policy maker can have more or less incentive to build a reputation

   social welfare. Not publishing individuals' votes, raises the temptation
   to inflate and lowers expected social welfare. If the culture or rules
   of a central bank puts more weight on senior policy makers, the
   incentive to build a reputation is greater, but expected social welfare
   may be higher or lower.},

Abstract = {Strategy implementation and performance in organizations are influenced
   by its market orientation. Market orientation is the collective of
   employee behaviors that affects strategy implementation, how an
   organization interacts with its environment and adjusts to changes
   within that context. The relationship between market orientation,
   strategy implementation, and performance is robust across environmental
   contexts. This study identifies ideal behavioral profiles for
   organizations seeking to maximize performance by considering the scope
   and impact of market orientation on strategy implementation. This is
   accomplished by considering market orientation and strategy profiles in
   relation to performance in a holistic coalignment perspective,
   corresponding to competitive contexts characterized by varying degrees
   of market turbulence and competitive intensity. Important strategic and
   performance implications of this dynamic are revealed that should be
   considered by academics and practitioners alike. Copyright (C) 2003 John

Volume = {81},
Number = {6},
Pages = {58+},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Turnaround champions-those leaders who manage to bring distressed
   organizations back from the brink of failure-are often acclaimed for
   their canny financial and strategic decision making. But having studied
   their work closely, Harvard Business School's Rosabeth Moss Kanter
   emphasizes another aspect of their achievement. These leaders reverse
   the cycle of corporate decline through deliberate interventions that
   increase the level of communication, collaboration, and respect among
   their managers.
   Ailing companies descend into what Kanter calls a ``death spiral,{''}
   which typically works this way: After an initial blow to the company's
   fortunes, people begin pointing fingers and deriding colleagues in other
   parts of the business. Tensions rise and collaboration declines. Once
   they are no longer acting in concert, people find themselves less able
   to effect change. Eventually, many come to believe they are helpless.
   Passivity sets in. Finally, the ultimate pathology of troubled companies
   takes hold: denial. Rather than volunteer an opinion that no one else
   seems to share, people engage in collective pretense to ignore what they
   individually know.
   To counter these dynamics, Kanter says, and reverse the company's slide,
   the CEO needs to apply certain psychological interventions-specifically,
   replacing secrecy and denial with dialogue, blame and scorn with
   respect, avoidance and turf protection with collaboration, and passivity
   and helplessness with initiative. The author offers in-depth accounts of
   how the CEOs at Gillette, Invensys, and the BBC used these interventions
   to guide their employees out of corporate free fall and onto a more
   productive path.},

Abstract = {The study presented in this paper examines how beliefs about coworkers

   This study investigates whether these perceptions can actually hinder
   group discussion and performance, and considers the contexts in which
   these detrimental effects are more or less likely to arise. Results
   indicate that although perceptions of higher achievement motivation in
   coworkers lowered performance when task information was partially
   shared, they raised performance when task information was fully shared.
   A content analysis of group discussions reveals that the discussion
   behaviors examined by this study, rather than the more frequently
   examined bias toward discussing common information, mediated these
   results.},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {In this article, a theory of the emotional/relational origins of male
   violence is outlined, and illustrated by episodes in Hitler's life.
   Drawing on earlier work on aggression and violence, it is proposed that
   three conditions lead to rage and violence: (i) no affectional
   attachments, (ii) a single overarching obsession, and (iii) the complete
   repression of shame. Only to the extent that all three of these
   conditions are fully met is destructive violence likely. Although women
   in whom these three conditions were present would be as likely as men to
   commit violent acts, men qualify much more frequently and fully than
   women. Key features of the theory are illustrated by applying it to
   details in biographies of Hitler This case suggests a way in which
   emotions unite leaders and led, leading to collective violence. Finally,
   a method that would provide a preliminary test of the theory is
   suggested.},

Year = {2003},
Volume = {81},
Number = {6},
Pages = {104+},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {In the 1990s, funding pension obligations by investing in stocks looked
   smart. By 1999,the bull market had poured a collective \$260 billion
   surplus into the pension coffers of the S\&P 500, permitting the
   companies to record the year-to-year increases as additional income. But
   just two years later,the bear market had obliterated those gains,
   replacing them with a cavernous \$240 billion deficit-which had to be
   offset by the unlucky firms' ongoing cash flows, wreaking havoc on their
   earnings, debt levels, and stock prices.
   Corporate executives may be blamed for this debacle. But they were only
   following the rules. Current accounting guidelines keep companies from
   recording pension liabilities and assets on their balance sheets,
   instead relegating them to the footnotes. That makes it hard to see the
   risk that market drops expose companies to.
   Board members and top executives need to look beyond distorted
   accounting numbers to the economic realities of pension plans. Once they
   do, they may be surprised to find that they would gain far greater value
   and flexibility by passively investing their pension funds entirely in
   bonds.
   A bond portfolio can be designed to meet precisely, and with virtual
   certainty, a company's pension obligation, thus eliminating the chance
   of a funding gap. The predictability of bond investments also stabilizes
   earnings and cash flow. The expanded corporate debt capacity that
   results can then be used to fuel growth or reduce the firm's overall
   cost of capital. Even without an overhaul of today's misguided
   accounting rules, there's little reason for companies' pension funds to
   hold anything other than bonds.},

   generation of core employee commitment to collective problem solving and
   the development of firm-specific capabilities. Such commitment is often

   These differences affect their development of coordinating, learning and

   encouraged to adopt varying degrees of authority sharing with groups of
   employees and business partners, and to invest in organizational careers
   to varying extents, by different institutional frameworks. In
   particular, variations in states' coordinating roles, the strength of
   business associations, the market for corporate control and the
   organization of training systems affect firms' delegation of discretion
   and career types. As a result, firms in different institutional

   article makes is fourfold. First, it illustrates the role of individual
   and group narratives in processes of collective sensemaking. Second, it
   discusses the importance of work narratives in the efforts of
   individuals and groups to define their shared identities. Third, it
   outlines a view of organizations as storytelling milieux in which group
   narratives play important hegemonic and legitimatory roles. Finally, our
   focus on narratives, and the plurivocal understandings of actions and
   events they often encompass, is, we maintain, one useful means by which
   polysemy can be read back into case study research.},

Abstract = {In this study, the existence of the team halo effect, the phenomenon
   that teams tend not to be blamed, for their failures, is documented.
   With 2 studies using both real teams and controlled scenarios, the
   authors found evidence that the nature of the causal attribution
   processes used to diagnose failure scenarios leads to individuals being
   more likely to be identified as the cause of team failure than the team
   as a collective. Team schema development, as indexed by team experience,
   influences this effect, with individuals who have more team experience
   being less likely to show the team halo effect.},

Abstract = {Despite considerable awareness about various forms and meanings of
   participative decision-making (PDM) in different parts of the world,
   there is less agreement on the causes of variation in PDM. This article
   argues that among other exogenous (e.g. sociopolitical, legal,
   historical) forces, the sociocultural context plays an important role in
   the observed differences among PDM approaches and practices across
   nations. Similarly, subcultures and organizational cultures may
   influence PDM within nations. Two cultural dimensions:
   individualism-collectivism and power distance, are linked with four
   widespread employee participation approaches: face-to-face PDM,
   collective PDM, pseudo-PDM, and paternalistic PDM. The attributes of
   each PDM form, including the cultural determinants, underlying beliefs,
   the types of decisions made, and the relationship between a specified
   form and other PDM meanings (e.g. self-managing teams) are elaborated.},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Increasingly wide income disparities, higher levels of education, and
   greater awareness of other cultures' ideas of the good life have given
   rise to a new class of American consumer. And a new category of products
   and services, including automobiles, apparel, food, wine, and spirits,
   has sprung into being to cater to it. That category is called new
   luxury. America's middle-market consumers are trading up to higher
   levels of quality and taste than ever before. Members of the middle
   market (those earning \$50,000 and above annually) collectively have
   around si trillion of disposable income. And they will pay premiums Of
   20\% to 200\% for well-designed, well-engineered, and well-crafted goods
   that can't be found in the mass middle market and that have the
   artisanal touches of traditional luxury items. Most important, even when
   they address basic necessities, such goods evoke and engage consumers'
   emotions while feeding their aspirations for a better life.
   Supply-side forces are essential to the rise of new luxury. Like the
   consumers of their goods, entrepreneurs are better educated and more
   sophisticated about their customers than ever before. In addition,
   global sourcing, falling trade barriers and transportation costs, and
   rising offshore manufacturing standards are making possible the
   economical production of alluring products of high quality.
   Unlike old-luxury goods, new-luxury products can generate high sales
   volumes despite their relatively high prices. As a result, new-luxury
   companies are achieving levels of profitability and growth beyond the
   reach of their conventional competitors. Whether the item in question is
   a \$6 Panera sandwich or a \$30,000 Mercedes, new luxury is a formula
   that middle-market companies, facing erosion of their market share by
   high-end and low-end producers, can ill afford to ignore.},

Number = {2},
Pages = {209-221},
Month = {SPR},
Abstract = {Indirect network externality (INE) effect exists when the utility of a
   product increases with the greater availability of compatible
   complementary products. We demonstrate that INE effects can vary by
   product attributes, with externality-sensitive attributes gaining more
   from increased availability of complementary products than other
   attributes. Past research has assumed that the benefit of increased
   availability of complementary products (e.g., software) accrues to the
   entire product (e.g., hardware). Utilizing data covering a period from
   1985 to 1995 on compact disc player prices, attributes, and CD titles
   releases, and using a hedonic price approach, we find significant
   positive interactions between CD title availability and two attributes
   of the CD player, namely, changer capacity and its oversampling rate. In
   addition to INE-attribute interactions, increased availability of CD
   titles is found to have a significant positive impact on the overall
   price of CD players, which is consistent with past research.
   Collectively, these effects of INE have helped reduce the yearly decline
   in the price of CD players. The finding that INE effects differentially
   affect different attributes can help managers in decisions such as
   pricing, timing of introduction, and changing the levels of
   INE-sensitive attributes.},

Abstract = {This paper presents an experimental investigation of risk preferences in
   the context of compensation. In five studies, participants indicated
   their preference between a job offering a fixed salary and one having a
   lower certain component but the potential to earn a higher amount
   contingent on performance. Results demonstrate that people are not
   generally risk averse in this context, as found in earlier research, but
   rather that risk preferences depend on the nature of the variable pay
   plan. In particular, in both between- and within-subjects designs,
   variable pay was preferred more often when incentives were based on
   individual rather than collective (team or organizational) performance,
   and participants were more optimistic about the likelihood of receiving
   incentives as individuals. The effects of individual differences such as
   self-efficacy and preference for group work were contingent on the
   format of the variable pay plan. Implications for designing compensation
   plans and employee recruitment and retention are discussed. (C) 2002

Journal = {ADMINISTRATIVE SCIENCE QUARTERLY},
Year = {2003},
Volume = {48},
Number = {1},
Pages = {60-93},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {This article develops and tests theory on when and where a new
   organizational form will emerge. Recent theory holds that as the number
   of organizations using a particular external identity code first
   increases beyond a critical minimal level, the code becomes an
   organizational form. Going beyond this formulation, we theorize about
   how an external identity code is established. We argue that when the
   identities of individual organizations are perceptually focused, they
   will more readily cohere into a distinct collective identity. We develop
   ideas about how two observable aspects of organizations might generate
   perceptually focused identities in a common market: (1) de novo entry
   and (2) agglomeration in a geographic place with a related identity.
   Using comprehensive data from the market for disk drive arrays, we test
   these ideas and an alternative by estimating effects of different
   specifications of organizational and product densities on rates of entry
   and exit for array producers. Overall, the analysis supports the notion
   that firms with perceptually focused identities aid in establishing an
   organizational form.},

Abstract = {Collaborative technologies such as group support systems (GSS) are often
   developed to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of teams; however,
   the satisfaction users have with the processes and outcomes of the
   teamwork itself often determines the ultimate adoption and sustained use
   of collaborative technologies. Much of the research on teamwork has
   focused on meetings in particular and, consequently, satisfaction with
   the process and outcomes of meetings, referred to collectively as
   meeting satisfaction. Research on meeting satisfaction in GSS-supported
   groups has been equivocal, indicating the need for advancement in our
   theoretical understanding of the construct. To that end, this paper
   presents a causal model of meeting satisfaction derived from goal
   setting theory. The model is tested with an empirical study consisting
   of 15 GSS groups and 11 face-to-face (FTF) groups engaged in the ``lost
   at sea{''} task. The results of analysis using structural equation
   modeling indicate support for the model's integrity across both GSS and
   FTF groups. Implications for researchers and practitioners are
   discussed, including how the model can be used to improve future
   research on the use of collaborative technology to support teamwork.},

   considerations},
Journal = {ORGANIZATION STUDIES},
Year = {2003},
Volume = {24},
Number = {3},
Pages = {463-491},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The social-psychological literature on trust in organizational superiors
   implies that it is an interpersonal phenomenon, based on the superior's
   behaviours and on subordinates' perceptions of the superior's behaviours
   and qualities. The sociological literature, in contrast, implies that
   trust in a superior is a property of the system in which the
   superior-subordinate relationship is embedded. In this article, we
   suggest that trust is both an interpersonal and a collective phenomenon
   and focus on the linkages between three levels of trust: the system
   level, the group level, and the individual level. We use a longitudinal
   quantitative analysis of cadets' trust in their team commanders and a
   qualitative analysis of critical incidents of trust building and erosion
   to develop and support three propositions. First, trust in a superior
   reflects subordinates' trust in the system that the superior represents.
   Second, subordinates employ criteria derived from systemic properties
   such as collective identities and values to evaluate the trustworthiness
   of their superior. Third, team processes play a major role in the social
   construction of trust in a superior and in translating systemic

Abstract = {Currently, two models of innovation are prevalent in organization
   science. The ``private investment{''} model assumes returns to the
   innovator result from private goods and efficient regimes of
   intellectual property protection. The ``collective action{''} model
   assumes that under conditions of market failure, innovators collaborate
   in order to produce a public good. The phenomenon of open source
   software development shows that users program to solve their own as well
   as shared technical problems, and freely reveal their innovations
   without appropriating private returns from selling the software. In this
   paper, we propose that open source software development is an exemplar
   of a compound ``private-collective{''} model of innovation that contains
   elements of both the private investment and the collective action models
   and can offer society the ``best of both worlds{''} under many
   conditions. We describe a new set of research questions this model
   raises for scholars in organization science. We offer some details
   regarding the types of data available for open source projects in order
   to ease access for researchers who are unfamiliar with these, and also
   offer some advice on conducting empirical studies on open source
   software development processes.},

Abstract = {This paper reviews alternative management accounting research in AOS
   from 1976 until 1999. We highlight seven different research perspectives
   that have flourished under this label: a non-rational design school;
   naturalistic research; the radical alternative; institutional theory;
   structuration theory; a Foucauldian approach; and a Latourian approach.
   It is contended that these different approaches have assumed an
   important role in raising a number of significant and interesting
   disciplinary insights. As a form of collective non-positivist
   enterprise, alternative management accounting research has demonstrated:
   the many different rationalities of management accounting practice; the
   variety of ways in which management accounting practice is enacted and
   given meaning; the potency of management accounting technologies; the
   unpredictable, non-linear and socially-embedded nature of management
   accounting change; and the ways in which management accounting practice
   is both constrained and enabled by the bodily habitudes of its
   exponents. In conclusion, we consider how alternative management
   accounting research may sustain its distinct contributions in the
   future. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

   value differences},
Journal = {ORGANIZATION STUDIES},
Year = {2003},
Volume = {24},
Number = {1},
Pages = {29-46},
Abstract = {This study seeks to extend the body of knowledge of international and
   cross-cultural entrepreneurship and management research by testing
   hypotheses dealing with the degree of variance in cultural values
   between entrepreneurs and non-entrepreneurs in two countries of the
   former Soviet Union: Russia and Georgia. A total of 867 entrepreneurs,
   managers, and production employees responded to a survey based on
   Hofstede's. work-related cultural values framework. Significant
   differences between entrepreneurs and non-entrepreneurs existed on three
   of five cultural dimensions: Power Distance Masculinity and Long-term
   Orientation. However,,, the study also demonstrated that, in
   international entrepreneurship research, making distinctions between
   entrepreneurs and the rest of the population is not as fruitful as
   contrasting entrepreneurs with specific occupational and status groups.
   Thus, in this study entrepreneurs were, in some cases, different from
   managers but similar to employees, and, in some other cases, similar to
   managers but different from employees. An important implication is that
   some values are deeper rooted in a culture's fabric and are less
   malleable than others. Thus, for Russia, Power Distance and Masculinity
   were substantially different from the earlier reported levels, whereas
   Individualism and Long-term Orientation were close to them. Also, for
   constructs measured in this study, significant differences were found in
   entrepreneurial and work-related values between the two countries of the
   former USSR, despite similarities iit economic, political, and
   ideological legacies.},

Journal = {ORGANIZATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2003},
Volume = {14},
Number = {1},
Pages = {81-90},
Month = {JAN-FEB},
Abstract = {Competitiveness in global industries increasingly requires the ability
   to develop trusting relationships. This requires organizations, and the
   individuals they are comprised of, to be both trustworthy and trusting.
   An important question is whether societal culture influences the
   tendency of individuals and organizations to trust. Based largely on
   Yamagishi's (1994, 1998a, b) theories explaining trust, commitment, and
   in-group bias in collectivist cultures, this study examines potential
   differences in levels of trust between individualist and collectivist
   cultures. Survey data was collected from 1,282 mid-level managers from
   large banks in Japan, Korea, Hong Kong, Taiwan, China, Malaysia. and the
   United States. We first study differences in how individuals from
   individualist and collectivist societies trust in-groups versus
   out-groups. This provides an important foundation for hypotheses
   regarding differences in individual propensities to trust and two
   measures of organizational trust: internal trust (trust within the
   organization) and external trust (an organization's trust for suppliers,
   customers, etc.). Findings show higher levels of propensity to trust and
   organizational external trust in the United States than in Asia.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2003},
Volume = {29},
Number = {3},
Pages = {401-426},
Abstract = {This study examines the role of entrepreneurship in building cultural
   competitiveness in organizations. Cultural competitiveness is defined as
   the degree to which organizations are predisposed to detect and fill
   gaps between what the market desires and what is currently offered. It
   is examined in this study as the collective result of interactions among
   four variables: entrepreneurship, innovativeness, market orientation,
   and organizational learning. Among these variables, entrepreneurship
   represents the most influential and proactive means of developing a
   market-based culture. However the role of entrepreneurship differs
   depending on organizational type. Based on data from a sample of 764
   organizations, superior performance occurs when certain aspects of
   cultural competitiveness fit each of four organizational types.
   Specifically, large and young organizations achieve strong performance
   by focusing directly on entrepreneurship. In the other organizational
   types, entrepreneurship has an indirect effect on performance (i.e.,
   large and old organizations perform better by focusing on organizational
   learning; small and old organizations benefit from a market orientation;
   and small and young organizations perform better by focusing on a
   balanced or selective approach where all four cultural competitiveness
   elements are emphasized or only one idiosyncratic element is emphasized,
   respectively). (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT STUDIES},
Year = {2003},
Volume = {40},
Number = {1},
Pages = {23-55},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {This paper draws upon activity theory to analyse an empirical
   investigation of the micro practices of strategy in three UK
   universities. Activity theory provides a framework of four interactive
   components from which strategy emerges; the collective structures of the
   organization, the primary actors, in this research conceptualized as the
   top management team (TMT), the practical activities in which they
   interact and the strategic practices through which interaction is
   conducted. Using this framework, the paper focuses specifically on the
   formal strategic practices involved in direction setting, resource
   allocation, and monitoring and control. These strategic practices are
   associated with continuity of strategic activity in one, case study but
   are involved in the reinterpretation and change of strategic activity in
   the other two cases. We model this finding into activity theory-based
   typologies of the cases that illustrate the way that practices either
   distribute shared interpretations or mediate between contested
   interpretations of strategic activity. The typologies explain the
   relationships between strategic practices and continuity and change of
   strategy as practice. The paper concludes by linking activity theory to
   wider change literatures to illustrate its potential as an integrative
   methodological framework for examining the subjective and emergent
   processes through which strategic activity is constructed.},

Abstract = {We develop a theory of the effects of inter-organizational networks on
   both radical and incremental forms of firm-level entrepreneurial
   behavior (EB). The central argument is that structural embeddedness,
   with its focus on the network as a whole, and its two consequences,
   relational and cognitive embeddedness, individually and collectively
   influence incremental and radical forms of EB. Relationships in our
   model are driven by reciprocal interactions between intra- and
   inter-organizational sensemaking. This reasoning leads us to a dynamic,
   co-evolutionary model of EB. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights

Title = {Materialism and well-being: A conflicting values perspective},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH},
Year = {2002},
Volume = {29},
Number = {3},
Pages = {348-370},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Over the past decade, materialism has emerged as an important research
   topic. Materialism is generally viewed as the value placed on the
   acquisition of material objects. Previous research finds that high
   levels of material values are negatively associated with subjective
   well-being. However, relatively little is known about the relationship
   between materialism and well-being within the broader context of an
   individual's value system. In this article, we examine the relationship
   between material values and other important life values. In addition, we
   draw on values theory to examine a novel conceptualization of why
   materialism is antithetical to well-being. Specifically, our theory
   proposes that the individual orientation of material values conflicts
   with collective-oriented values, such as family values and religious
   values. This state of values conflict creates psychological tension, and
   this tension is associated with a reduced sense of well-being. Using
   both a survey sample of 373 adults from across the United States and an
   experimental study of 120 college students, we find considerable support
   for this conflicting values perspective.},

Title = {Corporate environmental paradigms in shift: Learning during the course

Journal = {JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT STUDIES},
Year = {2002},
Volume = {39},
Number = {8},
Pages = {1087-1109},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Contrary to the popular conception in the corporate environmental
   management literature that corporations must learn new ecocentric
   paradigms before they can be expected to produce environmentally sound
   performance, the present results suggest that cognitive-level
   environmental learning in organizations does not inevitably precede
   behaviour change. Rather, at least partially, such learning is likely to
   occur in the course of action. The article also proposes that external
   pressure can set motion, but it alone does not lead to an environmental
   paradigm shift. In order to undergo such a shift, organizations will
   have to learn a meaning of their own to support new, more
   environmentally sound forms of activity.
   The present study examines empirically how two companies have learnt to
   incorporate environmental considerations into their managerial
   paradigms. It adopts a perspective according to which learning is
   portrayed as a process in which changes are brought about in the
   collective beliefs that the organization members hold about the
   relationship of their business to the natural environment (i.e.
   environmental management paradigm). Applying the grounded theory
   approach, the article identifies phases of environmental learning
   starting from the recognition or rejection of weak signals in `pockets'
   of the organization, continuing through the gaining of new knowledge and
   experience towards `competition' between old and new assumptions about
   the business-environment relationship, and finally proceeding to
   potential frame-break.},

   Personality similarity to peers was positively associated with promotion
   in units with high individualism. In units with high collectivism,
   supervisor-subordinate personality similarity was instead a significant
   predictor of advancement. Behavioral integration between candidates and
   their peers and supervisors partially mediated the influence of
   personality similarity on promotion. Demographic similarity had little
   influence on promotion decisions. We discuss implications for

Volume = {40},
Number = {4},
Pages = {387-403},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Stakeholder theory is a pertinent example of a framework that has been
   stretched over many conceptual contexts and that has been applied to a
   wide variety of empirical phenomena. A pressing issue involves the scope
   of application of stakeholder theory, however, because it is not a
   comprehensive ethical scheme or problem-solving algorithm. We begin our
   search for the boundaries of stakeholder management by identifying a
   presently under-acknowledged yet major underlying assumption, notably
   that the approach is rooted in voluntary action and association.
   Building on this presumption, we argue that firm stakeholder
   relationships are best to be understood in contractualist terms; i.e. as
   voluntary arrangements between two or more parties seeking mutual
   benefit. This assertion subsequently allows us to identify three
   boundary conditions applying to stakeholder theory: (1) the parties
   should be sufficiently autonomous; (2) their interests need to be
   alignable; and (3) they should be capable of living up to their
   commitments. We substantiate these criteria with evidence from a
   collective case study of buyer supplier -relationships in the Dutch
   manufacturing sector, demonstrating that the stakeholder management
   model fails when these boundary criteria are violated.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT STUDIES},

Volume = {39},
Number = {7},
Pages = {927-952},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {This paper examines how dress can be implicated in contests regarding
   individual and organizational identities. Identities are understood as
   being constituted within discursive regimes, and to be subjectively
   available to people in the form of self-narratives. The pluralism and
   polyphony that characterize organizations means that collective
   self-narratives are likely to be fractured, contested and multilayered.
   It is in this context that attire is an important object symbol that
   conveys information about the individual and collective self Here we
   focus on aspects of dress, especially the Islamic headscarf, and its
   role in the dynamics of Collective identity maintenance and challenge in
   one all-female Turkish university department. Our ethnographic approach
   yielded multiple, related and sometimes overlapping story lines centred
   on dress. These we have chosen to represent as a single though
   multi-voiced faculty narrative in order to facilitate analysis of what
   was a particularly rich symbolic milieu. The principal research
   contribution of this paper is as a discussion of participants' clothing
   in the constitution of individual and organizational narrative
   identities, and its importance for understanding the dynamics of
   identity conflicts.},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {We've all heard the stories about corporate giants who ignored
   disruptive innovations and paid a steep price: Think what the personal
   computer did to Digital or Japanese economy cars did to the Big Three
   automakers. Big companies now spend a lot of time and money trying to
   make sure they don't get blindsided by their smaller, leaner
   counterparts.
   But it's not easy to distinguish genuine threats from also-rans as they
   emerge. Most of the nascent technologies that typically bombard
   executives will not amount to competitive threats and deserve to be
   ignored. As a result, disruptions are usually not taken seriously until
   they become obvious - when it's often too late.
   A disruptive innovation is a technology, product, or process that creeps
   up from below an existing business and threatens to displace it.
   Usually, the disrupter offers lower performance and less functionality
   at a much lower price. The product or process is good enough to meet
   some customers' needs; others welcome the disruption's simplicity.
   Gradually, it improves to the point where it displaces the incumbent.
   But, the authors argue, disruption isn't inevitable. They have developed
   a tool that can help companies detect potential disruptive innovations
   while management still has time to respond effectively. The tool's
   decision-making methodology harnesses the organization's collective
   wisdom to determine how likely it is that a particular innovation will
   seriously damage an incumbent's business. The methodology has two
   components: an analytical instrument and an organizational process.
   There's nothing magical about it - but it gets managers to think
   systematically about identifying and addressing threats to the core
   business. And the tool's rigorous approach can spell the difference
   between flailing around and acting effectively in the face of a serious
   competitive threat.},

Title = {The politics of imagined stability: A psychodynamic understanding of

Abstract = {The aim of this article is to show how psychodynamic theory and its
   application can inform the management of change in organizations. The
   article outlines a psychodynamic framework for the management of change,
   emphasizing the interrelation between individual and collective
   emotional experience and power relations. The phrase a politics of
   imagined stability is used to describe the role that social and
   strategic politics play in the perpetuation of emotions and fantasies
   that have an impact on organizing. The framework involves understanding
   how the organization is imagined, experienced and maintained through the
   influence of social and strategic politics, as well as the resulting
   emotional and political relations within which attempts at change have
   to be managed. The conceptual framework is illustrated and developed
   through a case example from Hyder plc, formerly the largest private
   company in Wales, UK. The discussion and conclusion outline the articles
   contribution to knowledge concerning psychodynamic thinking and the
   management of change.},

Journal = {ORGANIZATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2002},
Volume = {13},

Pages = {475-496},
Month = {SEP-OCT},
Abstract = {We empirically explore the legitimating accounts for and against
   policies precluding workplace discrimination against gay, lesbian,
   bisexual, and transgender people, focusing on how agents working at both
   the national level and within organizations use broader cultural
   accounts in building their legitimating accounts in local settings. The
   diffusion perspective in institutional theory has portrayed how agents
   import ``ready-to-wear{''} cultural accounts. In contrast, translation
   theory depicts how agents interpret and adapt cultural accounts as they
   fashion them into legitimating accounts for a local setting. An
   alternative would theorize accounts that are neither strictly borrowed
   nor idiosyncratically tailored. We advanced a third perspective, drawing
   on frame analysis as it is used in social movement theory. Framing
   theory attends to both the importance of cultural building blocks and
   the embedded ways in which agents relate to and shape systems of meaning
   and mobilize collective action to change social arrangements. We find
   that legitimating accounts are intertwined with the construction of
   social identities, which serve to legitimate, on the one hand, an
   account maker's participation in the discourse and set of claims, and on
   the other hand, the involvement of proponents and crucial audiences. We
   suggest that the mobilizing potential of legitimating accounts rests in
   part on their messages becoming ``autocommunicational,{''} so that
   listeners identify themselves with the message.},

Abstract = {Capital market participants collectively may possess information about
   the valuation implications of a firm's change in strategy not known by
   the management of the firm proposing the change. We ask whether a firm's
   management can exploit the capital market's information in deciding
   either whether to proceed with a contemplated strategy change or whether
   to continue with a previously initiated strategy change. In the case of
   a proposed strategy change, we show that managers can extract the
   capital market's information by announcing a potential new strategy, and
   then conditioning the decision to implement the new strategy on the size
   of the market's price reaction to the announcement. Under this
   arrangement, we show that a necessary condition to implement all and
   only positive net present value strategy changes is that managers
   proceed to implement some strategies that gamer negative price reactions
   upon their announcement. In the case of deciding whether to continue
   with a previously implemented strategy change, we show that it may be
   optimal for the firm to predicate its abandonment/continuation decision
   on the magnitude of the costs it has already incurred. Thus, what looks
   like ``sunk-cost{''} behavior may in fact be optimal.
   Both demonstrations show that, in addition to performing their usual
   role of anticipating future cash flows generated by a manager's actions,
   capital market prices can also be used to direct a manager's actions. It
   follows that, in contrast to the usual depiction of the information
   flows between capital markets and firms as being one way - from firms to
   the capital markets - information also flows from capital markets to
   firms.},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {From 1994 through 2000, Nortel Networks transformed itself from a
   technology-focused to an opportunity/customer-focused company. By 2000,
   Nortel was a profitable, innovative leader in the telecommunications
   industry. The change was the result of an ambitious effort to redesign
   its entire new product development (NPD) process such that
   time-to-market was significantly reduced. NPD is highly
   knowledge-intensive work based on the individual and collective
   expertise of employees. The primary focus of this case study is on
   Nortel's efforts to reengineer the front-end of its NPD process and
   capitalize on knowledge assets. This effort was built around a
   process-oriented knowledge management (KM) strategy, involving a
   tripartite and systematic focus on process, people, and technology.
   Through our case analysis we develop a model of KM success by exploring
   Nortel's KM strategy and the managerial, resource, and environmental
   factors that influenced Nortel's success. Nortel's experiences suggest
   lessons for other firms attempting to manage knowledge assets in core
   business processes.},

Abstract = {In this study, we examine whether individualism/collectivism (I/C)
   orientations predict employee attitudes and behavioral intentions, and
   also consider whether I/C orientation moderates the relationship between
   equity perceptions and these variables. Four hundred and two employees
   from I I high technology and financial services companies participated
   in this study. Results indicated that the competitiveness dimension of
   I/C moderated the relationships. between equity perceptions and effort,
   and equity perceptions and obligations towards teamwork Similarly, the
   solitary work preference dimension of I/C moderated the relationships
   between equity perceptions and career intent, and equity perceptions and
   obligations towards teamwork The interactions between equity perceptions
   and I/C dimensions produced interesting effects. The results suggest
   that varying levels of equity perceptions. are associated with different
   effects on employee attitudes and behavioral intentions depending on the
   level of employee individualism or collectivism orientations. Also, the
   solitary work preference dimension of I/C was positively related to
   organizational commitment, contrary to the hypothesized direction.
   Implications for research and practice are discussed.},

Title = {<i>What makes</i> great boards great},
Journal = {HARVARD BUSINESS REVIEW},
Year = {2002},
Volume = {80},
Number = {9},
Pages = {106+},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {In the wake of meltdowns at WorldCom, Tyco, and Enron, enormous
   attention has been focused on the companies' boards. It seems
   inconceivable that business disasters of such magnitude could happen
   without gross or even criminal negligence on the part of board members.
   And yet a close examination of those boards reveals no broad pattern of
   incompetence or corruption. In fact, they followed most of the accepted
   standards for board operations: Members showed up for meetings; they had
   money invested in the company; audit committees, compensation
   committees, and codes of ethics were in place; the boards weren't too
   small or too big, nor were they dominated by insiders.
   In other words, they passed the tests that would normally be applied to
   determine whether a board of directors was likely to do a good job. And
   that's precisely what's so scary, according to corporate governance
   expert Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, who suggests that it's time for some new
   thinking about how corporate boards operate and are evaluated. He
   proposes thinking not only about how to structure the board's work but
   also about how to manage it as a social system.
   Good boards are, very simply, high-functioning work groups. They're
   distinguished by a climate of respect, trust, and candor among board
   members and between the board and management. Information is shared
   openly and on time; emergent political factions are quickly eliminated.
   Members feel free to challenge one another's assumptions and
   conclusions, and management encourages lively discussion of strategic
   issues. Directors feel a responsibility to contribute meaningfully to
   the board's performance. In addition, good boards assess their own
   performance, both collectively and individually.},

Journal = {ORGANIZATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2002},
Volume = {13},
Number = {5},
Pages = {583-597},
Month = {SEP-OCT},
Abstract = {In this paper, we integrate findings from three field studies of
   technology intensive organizations to explore the process through which
   change occurred. In each case, problems were well recognized but had
   become entrenched and had failed to generate change. Across the three
   sites, organizational change occurred only after some event altered the
   accustomed daily rhythms of work, and thus changed the way people
   experienced time. This finding suggests that temporal shifts-changes in
   a collective's experience of time-can help to facilitate organizational
   change. Specifically, we suggest that temporal shifts enable change in
   four ways: (1) by creating a trigger for change, (2) by providing
   resources needed for change, (3) by acting as a coordinating mechanism,
   and (4) by serving as a credible symbol of the need to change.},

Journal = {ORGANIZATIONAL BEHAVIOR AND HUMAN DECISION PROCESSES},
Year = {2002},
Volume = {89},
Number = {1},
Pages = {813-838},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Previous research has shown that people's self-esteem and their
   group-oriented behavior are influenced by their judgments about the
   status of the groups to which they belong (pride) and assessments of
   their status within those groups (respect). These findings are important
   to justice researchers because the key antecedent of such status
   judgments is typically found to be the assessment of the fairness of
   group procedures (i.e., procedural justice). Research suggests that (1)
   procedural justice shapes status and that (2) status shapes self-esteem
   and group-oriented behavior. The paper reports the results of three
   studies comparing two different forms of these status judgments. The
   first form are autonomous judgments of pride and respect that are linked
   to the characteristics associated with membership in different groups.
   People link such judgments to inclusion or membership in the group. The
   second are comparative judgments of pride and respect that are linked to
   comparisons of one's status to the status of other people or groups. The
   results indicate that, within groups, people are influenced primarily by
   autonomous assessments of status based on their internal standards,
   which develop from the status associated with prototypical
   characteristics linked to inclusion in a group. People are less strongly
   influenced by comparisons of their status to the status of external
   comparison standards. Further, justice-based status inferences are shown
   to be primarily autonomous, and not comparative, in nature. (C) 2002

Volume = {39},

Pages = {189-195},

Abstract = {In this paper I explore the influence of an organisation's structure,
   such as that of the National Education System, in the emergence of
   desirable social properties. In this case the concern is schools with
   adequate performance. It is assumed that there is a circular causality
   between structure and the social results of schools. I highlight some of
   the structural requirements to have justice, sense of belonging, trust,
   honesty and cooperation as emerging properties of these schools, beyond
   normative statements. These are requirements for effective citizenship.
   In order to study this, it is necessary to observe the structures that
   constitute collectives into organisations. Central to this paper is a
   case study that I carried out at Millfield Primary School in the U.K.,
   which focused on the observation of citizenship as a dynamic process
   permanently being constructed. This case went beyond the normative
   understanding of citizenship as established in the new school curriculum
   to be implemented from September 2002. I take the view that the aim of
   citizenship is to build up a community in which one is constituted as a
   citizen. For that purpose we need enabling people to build up their own
   communities. My conclusion from this case study suggests that current
   educational methodologies aim at teaching a ``model of{''} citizenship
   rather than at providing the necessary tools to think about and create
   suitable spaces ``for{''} citizenship. The case study shows that it is
   necessary to reinforce in schools practical methods to create membership
   and respect for others.},

Title = {The dialogue between the `self' and the `other': A process analysis of
   Palestinian Jewish encounters in Israel},
Journal = {HUMAN RELATIONS},

Volume = {55},

Abstract = {This study assumes that the collective identities of both Jews and
   Palestinians in Israel have long been constructed around the
   Jewish-Palestinian conflict, a major focus of social and historical
   reality in the Middle East region. Monolithic in their early stages,
   these constructions of identity underwent a process of deconstruction
   and reconstruction, primarily due to changes in the political reality
   (the peace process), globalization, and the surfacing of conflicts that
   were hidden within the monolithic construction. The deconstruction
   process, though painful and problematic, creates new opportunities for a
   dialogue that engages elements of identity, which no longer `fit' the
   contenders. Such a dialogue took place in `laboratory' form at
   Ben-Gurion University of the Negev from October 1996 and June 1997
   between two leading participants in an ongoing workshop for Jewish and
   Palestinian Israeli students. Most conflict group encounters are
   measured by outcomes, not by process. We identified problems when the
   method common for these groups was used at Jewish-Palestinian encounters
   and this led us to try another way. This study employs a qualitative
   methodology to analyse the process of groups in conflict. It looks into
   how the process of questioning one's own self and the others perception
   takes place in this context. In describing the dialogue that evolved
   between a Jew, Avner and a Palestinian, Nasser (both pseudonyms), the
   tension between the individual and collective identity levels, between
   the internal group process and the asymmetric social and political
   reality, is revealed. We suggest that the confrontation and friendship
   between Avner and Nasser created a new quality of dialogue, enabling a
   more complex identity construction to emerge on both the Jewish and the
   Palestinian sides.},

Year = {2002},
Volume = {27},

Abstract = {Expanding global markets have resulted in renewed concern with
   accountability by transnational corporations and other economic agents.
   Reflections on economic accountability, however, often inadequately
   theorize necessary ethical presuppositions regarding the moral status of
   economic collectivities, including the scope of the moral community and
   the good that this community seeks. This essay addresses these ethical
   considerations. Taking as my starting point Schweiker's {[}Schweiker, W.
   (1993). Accounting for ourselves: accounting practice and the disclosure
   of ethics. Accounting Organizations and Society, 18(2/3), 231-252] claim
   that economic entities are properly accountable to a wider scope of good
   than their own by virtue of the accounts that accountants render of such
   entities, I argue that the discourse in terms of which the accounts are
   rendered serves to negate the very relation of obligation from which
   this accountability derives. Specifically, I argue that the discourse of
   neoclassical economics that informs accounting practice constructs the
   identity of the accountable entity such that it is obligated to pursue
   only its own good. Consequently, extant accounting practices are
   inadequate to meet the demands for accountability that are legitimately
   entailed by the act of rendering an account. I explore the implications
   of this conclusion for understanding economic accountability and related
   social accounting practices, and I propose the ethics of Emmanuel
   Levinas to establish a broader accountability on the part of economic
   entities. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {In recent years, there has been growing interest in co-operative
   arrangements for innovation, with some commentators arguing innovation
   is no longer the province of individual firms, but depends increasingly
   on collective action. This paper examines the response to the UK's
   version of the second European community innovation survey (CIS-2) to
   investigate the patterns of co-operation between innovating firms and
   external partners. The analysis shows the relationship between
   innovation and co-operation is not straightforward. From a subjective
   (i.e. firm based) perspective, it is clear that most firms still develop
   their new products, processes and services without forming (formal)
   co-operative arrangements for innovation with other organisations.
   However, firms that engage in R\&D and that are attempting to introduce
   higher level innovations, i.e. `new to the market' rather than `new to
   the firm' innovations-are much more likely to engage in co-operative
   arrangements for innovation. Consequently, if an objective (i.e.
   innovation-based) perspective is taken, which weighs innovations by
   their significance, then it is likely that a significant proportion of
   high-level innovations are developed through co-operative arrangements,
   although unfortunately the CIS-2 does not indicate the direct
   significance of these arrangements to the development of the
   innovations. In summary, the extent of co-operative arrangements for
   innovation appears to depend on the type of firms being considered and
   on what is meant by innovation. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All

Journal = {RESEARCH POLICY},
Year = {2002},
Volume = {31},
Number = {5},
Pages = {769-794},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Determining the value of scientific and technical knowledge poses a
   great many problems. One of the most acute and widely recognized is that
   the value of knowledge shifts dramatically over time as new uses for the
   knowledge emerge. A related problem is that market-based valuation of
   knowledge is an inadequate index of certain types of scientific
   knowledge. We present an alternative framework for the value of
   scientific and technical knowledge, one based not on market pricing of
   information, but instead, on the intensity and range of uses of
   scientific knowledge. Our ``churn{''} model of scientific knowledge
   value emphasizes the distinctive properties of scientific and technical
   knowledge and focuses on the social context of its production. In
   particular, we consider the value of scientific and technical knowledge
   in enhancing ``knowledge value collectives{''}, our term for the set of
   individuals who interact in the demand, production, technical
   evaluation, and application of scientific and technical knowledge. To
   illustrate the use of the chum model as an interpretive framework, we
   examine the recent history of the Internet and the churning knowledge
   use and transformation accompanying its emergence. The development of
   the knowledge brought together in the Internet shows us how little
   traditional disciplines and institutions help in explaining today's
   epoch-changing knowledge and technology innovations, We urge a focus on
   the social configurations producing knowledge value. Rather than
   counting discrete output, we argue that research evaluation is most
   helpful when its subject is the capacity of social configurations to
   produce new scientific and technical knowledge uses. (C) 2002 Elsevier

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Based on empirical analysis of 53 multi-institutional collaborations in
   physics and allied sciences, we find that generalizations about the
   essentially informal and collective social organization of collaborative
   projects in science stem largely from a narrow analysis of high-energy
   particle physics experiments. Cluster analysis reveals that the variety
   of organizational formats of collaborative projects can be grouped into
   four types, ranging from bureaucratic to participatory. Except for
   particle physics, which is overwhelmingly participatory and
   non-bureaucratic, the membership of the other three types is mostly
   cross-disciplinary. The four-fold typology discriminates collaborative
   projects with respect to their technological practices. The structure of
   leadership is related to the character of interdependence in data
   acquisition, analysis, and communication of results: greater
   interdependence leads to decentralization of leadership and less
   formalization. We conclude that extrapolation of the organizational
   characteristics of particle physics to scientific collaborations in
   general is unjustified. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

   generalized least squares is asymptotically normal and Gauss-Markov
   efficient with standard convergence rate. Despite the anomalous behavior
   of nonparametric spectrum estimates near a spectral pole, we are able to
   justify a standard construction of frequency-domain generalized least
   squares, earlier considered in case of short memory disturbances. A

Title = {Integrating knowledge in groups: How formal interventions enable
   flexibility},
Journal = {ORGANIZATION SCIENCE},

Volume = {13},

Abstract = {Recent perspectives have focused on the role of the firm in the
   generation and use of knowledge. These perspectives suggest that, while
   knowledge is ``owned{''} at the individual level, the integration of
   this knowledge to a collective level is necessary. This integration of
   knowledge typically takes place in groups. In our experimental study, we
   examine how individuals in groups engage in micro-level interactions to
   effectively integrate knowledge by examining the effects of using three
   formal interventions: Information Sharing, Questioning Others, and
   Managing Time. In particular, we observe that simple formal
   interventions can improve knowledge integration when they lead to
   ``windows of opportunity{''} for group members to consider ways to
   improve their work process that go beyond the formal intervention
   instructions. The most effective groups used these formal interventions
   to focus their attention into organized clusters of activity, during
   which they significantly changed their work process and improved their
   subsequent knowledge integration. In particular. groups in the
   Questioning Others and Managing Time conditions exhibited greater
   knowledge integration than groups in the Information Sharing and Control
   conditions. Groups with high-knowledge integration paced their attention
   to both adaptive improvements to their process and task execution.
   Overall, this study identifies simple structures. interruptions, and
   time pacing as central to the emerging concept of group flexibility by
   which members enhance their performance on novel and/or ambiguous tasks.
   We note links to complexity theory and knowledge-based thinking as well.},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Managers throughout the world regularly face ethical dilemmas that have
   important, and perhaps complex, professional and personal implications.
   Further, societal consequences of decisions made can be far-reaching. In
   this study, 210 financial services managers from Australia, Chile,
   Ecuador and the United States were queried about their ethical beliefs
   when faced with four diverse dilemmas. In addition, the situational
   context was altered so the respondent viewed each dilemma from a top
   management position and from a position of economic hardship. Results
   suggest a complex interaction of situation, culture and issue when
   individuals make ethical judgments. Specifically, Chileans were found to
   have different beliefs about sex discrimination and child labor dilemmas
   when compared to their colleagues from the other three nations. Chileans
   and Australians also disagreed on the bribery dilemma. Anglo managers
   were more likely than Latin American managers to change their ethical
   responses when the situation was altered. For multinational firms
   interested in maintaining healthy ethical climates, the findings suggest
   that culturally contingent ethical guidelines, or policies adapted to
   the local customs, must be considered. Further, managers must remain
   aware of issues related to specific situations, both internal and
   external, that would cause subordinates to alter their moral judgment.},

Journal = {HUMAN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2002},
Volume = {41},
Number = {2},
Pages = {261-270},

Abstract = {Research supports the conclusion that organizational commitment is
   affected more by procedural justice than by distributive justice, and
   this is especially true in collectivistic societies. The present
   research examines the effects of distributive justice on organizational
   commitment levels of Korean employees under layoff situations. It
   focuses on the moderating effects of two layoff variables: layoff
   experience and layoff perception. Data were collected front HR managers
   from 14 companies and 411 employees. It was found that layoff perception
   significantly moderated the effect of distributive justice on
   organizational commitment, while there was no significant effect found
   in the case of layoff experience. Additional analyses show that
   employees perceive a high level of distributive justice even in the case
   of layoffs when training on the appraisal methods are provided,
   Implications of these findings are included in the discussion. (C) 2002

   clarity, whereas leadership climate at a lower organizational level
   related to self-efficacy through psychological strain. Group-level
   analyses identified leadership climate at a higher organizational level
   as the strongest predictor of collective efficacy. Theoretical and

Abstract = {This paper examines a real cost of awarding employee stock options.
   Based on the observation that managers are extremely concerned about
   earnings-per-share dilution in equity related compensation, we predict
   and find that firms experiencing significant employee stock option (ESO)
   exercises shift resources away from real investments towards the
   repurchase of their own stocks. We further find weak evidence of a
   decline in subsequent firm performance (as measured by return on assets)
   for several years following the cut in discretionary invesments as a
   result of stock option exercises, though this result is sensitive to the
   metric used to measure performance. Collectively, our findings indicate
   that ESO exercises potentially impose a real cost on the firth in terms
   of foregone investment opportunities.},

Abstract = {This study draws on multiple writings to offer a new conceptualization,
   one that aids in the assessment of unethical practices. Traditionally,
   phenomenology and the sociology of knowledge have focused on perception,
   cognition and common sense. Ethnomethodology has focused on procedural
   infrastructures of ordinary lives. This article combines concepts and
   ideas from these methodologies in the general concept of `collective
   myopia' with some Habermasian and Foucaultian influences. The
   conceptualization focuses on normative controls operating behind the
   scenes of unethical practices in Japanese business. The contributions of
   national culture to the crimes arc omitted as much as possible to
   establish a position of general theory. The conceptualization is then
   applied to examine the case of the Dai-ichi Kangyo Batik, which was
   linked to racketeering in 1997.},

Abstract = {At times knowledge can be seen as the source of organizational
   innovation and change-at other times, however, it can be the very
   constraint on that change. This conflicted role offers insights into why
   the phenomenon of organizational knowledge has been interpreted by
   researchers in multiple and possibly conflicting ways. Some theories
   depict knowledge as an empirical phenomenon, residing in action and
   becoming ``organizational{''} in the acquisition. diffusion, and
   replication of those actions throughout the organization. Others
   consider it a latent phenomenon, residing in the possibility for
   constructing novel organizational actions. This paper argues that while
   each of these qualities-empirical and latent-are intrinsic to knowledge
   in organizations. our understanding of organizational phenomena is
   essentially incomplete until the relationship between them is
   considered. Building on structuration theory. we propose a complementary
   perspective that views organizational knowledge as the product of an
   ongoing and recursive interaction between empirical and latent
   knowledge. between knowledge as action and knowledge as possibility. We
   ground this complementary model of knowledge in evidence from the field
   study of two firms whose innovation practices provide unique insights
   into how knowledge simultaneously enables and constrains behavior in
   organizations. We then discuss how a complementary perspective avoids
   the reification of knowledge by depicting it instead as an ongoing and
   social process and offers an alternative distinction between individual
   and collective knowledge.},

   reconstituted as actors engage the world in practice. In interpreting
   the findings of an empirical study conducted in a geographically
   dispersed high-tech organization, I suggest that the competence to do
   global product development is both collective and distributed, grounded
   in the everyday practices of organizational members. I conclude by

   surveys of 201 managers from four types of companies in China:
   state-owned, collectively-owned, privately-owned, and foreign joint
   ventures. Results support the central notion that each ownership type
   exhibits a distinct environment-strategy configuration, which in turn
   has important performance implications for the firms.},

   individualism/collectivism level of each sample did not moderate the
   magnitude of correlations of work locus of control with measures of

Abstract = {To examine the effects of interorganizational network structures on
   acquisition decisions, we propose a model whereby firms learn by
   sampling the diverse experiences of their network partners. We tested
   this model by examining the effect of diversity of network partners'
   experience on firms' acquisition decisions, using data on acquisition
   premiums and acquirers' stock market performance from 1986 to 1997.
   Results show that firms tied to others with heterogeneous prior premium
   experience tend to pay less for their acquisitions and have
   better-performing acquisitions than those tied to others with
   homogeneous experience. Firms also pay lower premiums when their network
   partners (1) have completed deals of diverse sizes, (2) have unique
   information, and (3) are themselves of diverse sizes. Firms that have
   multiplex relationships with their partners receive even more benefit.
   The results extend prior research on networks and learning by showing
   that collective network experience affects firms' decision quality.},

Pages = {109+},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The collective behavior of people in crowds, markets, and organizations
   has long been a mystery. Why, for instance, do employee bonuses
   sometimes lead to decreases in productivity? Why do some products
   generate tremendous buzz seemingly out of nowhere, while others languish
   despite multimillion-dollar marketing campaigns? How could a simple
   clerical error snowball into a catastrophic loss that bankrupts a
   financial institution?
   Traditional approaches like spreadsheet and regression analyses have
   failed to explain such ``emergent phenomena,{''} says Eric Bonabeau,
   because they work from the top down, trying to apply global equations
   and frameworks to a particular situation. But the behavior of emergent
   phenomena, contends Bonabeau, is formed from the bottom up-starting with
   the local interactions of individuals who alter their actions in
   response to other participants. Together, the myriad interactions result
   in a group behavior that can easily elude any top-down analysis.
   But now, thanks to ``agent-based modeling,{''} some companies are
   finding ways to analyze - and even predict - emergent phenomena. Macy's,
   for instance, has used the technology to investigate better ways to
   design its department stores. Hewlett-Packard has run agent-based
   simulations to anticipate how changes in its hiring strategy would
   affect its corporate culture. And Societe Generale has used the
   technology to determine the operational risk of its asset management
   group.
   This article discusses emergent phenomena in detail and explains why
   they have become more prevalent in recent years. In addition to
   providing real-world examples of companies that have improved their
   business practices through agent-based modeling, Bonabeau also examines
   the future of this technology and points to several fields that may be
   revolutionized by its use.},

Abstract = {This paper considers the role of team learning in organizational

   into how organizational learning is impeded, hindering effective change
   in response to external pressures. In contrast to previous theoretical
   perspectives, I suggest that organizational learning is local,
   interpersonal, and variegated. I present data from an exploratory study
   of learning processes in 12 organizational teams engaged in activities
   ranging from strategic planning to hands-on manufacturing of products.
   These qualitative data are used to investigate two components of the
   collective learning process-reflection to gain insight and action to
   produce change-and to explore how teams allow an organization to engage
   in both radical and incremental learning, as needed in a changing and
   competitive environment. I find that team members' perceptions of power
   and interpersonal risk affect the quality of team reflection, which has
   implications for their team's and their organization's ability to
   change.},

Title = {Group polarization and computer-mediated communication: Effects of

Journal = {INFORMATION SYSTEMS RESEARCH},
Year = {2002},
Volume = {13},

Pages = {70-90},

Abstract = {Group polarization is the tendency of people to become more extreme in
   their thinking following group discussion. It may be beneficial to some,
   but detrimental to other, organizational decisions. This study examines
   how computer-mediated communication (CMC) may be associated with group
   polarization. Two laboratory experiments were carried out. The first
   experiment, conducted in an identified setting, demonstrated that
   removal of verbal cues might not have reduced social presence
   sufficiently to impact group polarization, but removal of visual cues
   might have reduced social presence sufficiently to raise group
   polarization. Besides confirming the results of the first experiment,
   the second experiment showed that the provision of anonymity might also
   have reduced social presence sufficiently to raise group polarization.
   Analyses of process data from both experiments indicated that the
   reduction in social presence might have increased group polarization by
   causing people to generate more novel arguments and engage in more
   one-upmanship behavior. Collectively, process and outcome data from both
   experiments reveal how group polarization might be affected by level of
   social presence. Specifically, group discussion carried out in an
   unsupported setting or an identified face-to-face CMC setting tends to
   result in weaker group polarization. Conversely, group discussion
   conducted in an anonymous face-to-face CMC setting or a dispersed CMC
   setting (with or without anonymity) tends to lead to stronger group
   polarization. Implications of these results for further research and
   practice are provided.},

Abstract = {This paper provides a theoretical framework for analyzing the impact of
   the marriage market and divorce legislation on household labor supply.
   In our approach, the sex ratio in the marriage market and the rules
   governing divorce are examples of ``distribution factors.{''} These
   factors are defined as variables that affect the household members'
   bargaining position but not preferences or the joint budget set. We
   extend the collective labor supply model developed by Chiappori to allow
   for distribution factors. We show that our model imposes new
   restrictions on the labor supply functions and eases the identification
   of individual preferences and the intrahousehold decision process. The
   model is estimated using PSID data for the year 1988. Our results do not
   reject the restrictions imposed by the model. Also, the sex ratio and
   divorce laws deemed favorable to women are found to affect labor supply
   behavior and the decision process in the directions predicted by the
   theory and to have sizable effects.},

   hierarchical culture-were more cooperative, expected others to be more
   cooperative, and were more likely to adopt an equal allocation
   distribution rule to resolve the dilemma than were groups of decision
   makers from the United States-an individualist, egalitarian culture. An
   opportunity for communication had a greater impact on expectations of
   others' behavior in groups of U.S. decision makers than in groups of
   Japanese decision makers.},

Journal = {ORGANIZATION STUDIES},
Year = {2002},
Volume = {23},

Pages = {169-188},
Abstract = {This paper argues that Karl Popper's notions in his work The Open
   Society and Its Enemies offer an approach to under-explored issues in
   organizational research, independent of Popper's epistemology. Popper's
   thoughts on the philosophy of science have largely been rejected in
   organization studies, and his socio-philosophical notions have hardly
   been considered. Yet they provide a frame of reference for viewing
   management trends, such as anti-bureaucratism and collectivist forms of
   work organization, in a different light. Popper's socio-philosophical
   notions suggest that `closed' patterns of thinking are detrimental to a
   liberal-democratic social order. The paper argues that an outline of the
   philosophy of openness and closedness and an application to managerial
   concepts allows for insights into whether certain types of managerial
   thinking stand in contrast to, or in accordance with, a
   liberal-democratic order. It is concluded that, through the Popperian
   lens, some supposedly liberationist movements of management (liberation
   from bureaucracy or from a lack of belonging and emotion at work)
   possess clear traits of closedness and thus resemble the intellectual
   underpinnings of totalitarianism.},

Title = {Knowledge-sharing dilemmas},
Journal = {ORGANIZATION STUDIES},
Year = {2002},
Volume = {23},
Number = {5},
Pages = {687-710},
Abstract = {The exchange of information among organizational employees is a vital
   component of the knowledge-management process. Modern information and
   telecommunication technology is available to support such exchanges
   across time and distance barriers. However, organizations investing in
   this type of technology often face difficulties in encouraging their
   employees to use the system to share their ideas. This paper elaborates
   on previous research, suggesting that sharing personal insights with
   one's co-workers may carry a cost for some individuals which may yield,
   at the aggregate level, a co-operation dilemma, similar to a public-good
   dilemma. A review of the research on different types of public-good
   dilemmas provides some indications of the specific interventions that
   may help organizations encourage the kind of social dynamics that will
   increase overall knowledge sharing. These interventions can be
   classified into three categories: interventions aimed at restructuring
   the pay-offs for contributing, those that try to increase efficacy
   perceptions, and those that make employees' sense of group:identity and
   personal responsibility more salient.},

Abstract = {Researchers criticize the transaction cost economics (TCE) paradigm for

   intra-group transactions, and collectivists in inter-group transactions.
   Our cultural specification of opportunism helps TCE to more effectively
   accommodate some criticisms and more realistically deal with problems of

   Drawing on individualism-collectivism theory, in this article we look at

   convergence between the etic- and emic-level approaches, thus
   strengthening individualism-collectivism theory. The emic-level findings

Abstract = {An employee is diagnosed with cancer or loses a family member
   unexpectedly. An earthquake destroys an entire section of a city,
   leaving hundreds dead, injured, or homeless. At times like these,
   managerial handbooks fail us. After all, leaders can't eliminate
   personal suffering, nor can they ask employees who are dealing with
   these crises to check their emotions at the door. But compassionate
   leadership can facilitate personal as well as organizational healing.
   Based on research the authors have conducted at the University of
   Michigan and the University of British Columbia's CompassionLab, this
   article describes what leaders can do to foster organizational
   compassion in times of trauma. They recount real-world examples,
   including a story of personal tragedy at Newsweek, natural disasters
   that affected Macy's and Malden Mills, and the events of September 11,
   2001.
   During times of collective pain and confusion, compassionate leaders
   take some form of public action, however small, that is intended to ease
   people's pain and inspire others to act. By openly demonstrating their
   own humanity, executives can unleash a compassionate response throughout
   the whole company, increasing bonds among employees and attachments to
   the organization.
   The authors say compassionate leaders uniformly provide two things: a
   ``context for meaning{''} - creating an environment in which people can
   freely express and discuss how they feel - and a ``context for
   action{''}-creating an environment in which those who experience or
   witness pain can find ways to alleviate their own and others' suffering.
   A leader's competence in demonstrating and fostering compassion is
   vital, the authors conclude, to nourishing the very humanity that can
   make people - and organizations - great.},

   creativity were produced with an awareness of my movement through time.
   Hockney not only helps me to explain the necessity of movement to
   understand organizing more dynamically, he also suggests that taking a
   dynamic approach to theorizing introduces intimacy. On this basis, the
   essay concludes with the speculation that my way of theorizing moves
   beyond the claims of subjectivity to interiorization - a willingness to
   embed oneself in the processes of organizing in order to describe their
   dynamics from the viewpoint of participation.},

Journal = {ORGANIZATION STUDIES},
Year = {2002},
Volume = {23},
Number = {3},
Pages = {421-447},
Abstract = {This paper focuses on issues of identity and identification in a
   UK-based institution of higher education (Westville(1) Institute). It is
   suggested that identity, both individual and collective, and the
   processes of identification which bind people to organizations, are
   constituted in the personal and shared narratives that people author in
   their efforts to make sense of their world and read meaning into their
   lives. The research contribution this paper makes is threefold. First,
   it illustrates how an organization's identity narrative evolves over
   time, and the variety of identification narratives, including
   dis-identification, neutral identification and schizo-identification, in
   terms of which participants define their relationship to it. Second, it
   makes a contribution to what are still rather inchoate efforts to
   theorize the dynamics of individual-collective processes of
   identification and identity constrcution. Finally, it argues that the
   efforts of senior managers to control processes of organizational
   identity formation, and participant identification, are interpretable as
   hegemonic acts required for legitimation purposes.},

Abstract = {Impulse buying generates over \$4 billion in annual sales volume in the
   United States. With the growth of e-commerce and television shopping
   channels, consumers have easy access to impulse purchasing
   opportunities, but little is known about this sudden, compelling,
   hedonically complex purchasing behavior in non-Western cultures. Yet
   cultural factors moderate many aspects of consumer's impulsive buying
   behavior, including self-identity, normative influences, the suppression
   of emotion, and the postponement of instant gratification. From a
   multi-country survey of consumers in Australia, United States, Hong
   Kong, Singapore, and Malaysia, our analyses show that both regional
   level factors (individualism-collectivism) and individual cultural
   difference factors (independent-interdependent self-concept)
   systernatically influence impulsive purchasing behavior.},

   professionals participated in the collective development towards LO
   ideals, but nearly fell into a propaganda trap. The case also highlights
   the importance of honouring psychological contracts, as a covenant with
   the workforce, leveraged the company's dominant industry position, and
   restored an atmosphere of mutuality with a marginalized rump. Noting
   that the local company may have been blessed with relatively munificent
   circumstances, I identify four viability tasks that aspiring LOs may
   need to perform continually in order to forestall disillusionment.},

Journal = {ORGANIZATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2002},
Volume = {13},
Number = {1},
Pages = {64-80},
Month = {JAN-FEB},
Abstract = {The purpose of stakeholder management is to facilitate our understanding
   of increasingly unpredictable external environments, thereby
   facilitating our ability to manage within these environments. We argue
   that a powerful implicit assumption within the stakeholder
   literature-that priorities within role-based stakeholder groups are
   relatively homogeneous-blurs our understanding of
   organization-stakeholder relationships. Two important and related areas
   of concern are presented. The first involves the primacy of role in
   stakeholder definition. This role primacy approach to stakeholder
   definition is appropriate if, for a particular issue, role-based
   stakeholder group members have similar priorities. Individual and
   collective self-interest provides a rationale for this assumption.
   However, an important problem with this approach arises in situations in
   which self-interest is not the primary motivator of individuals'
   priorities. In these instances, subgroups within different role-based
   stakeholder group, might have more similar priorities than either
   subgroup has with others within their role-based stakeholder group. In
   these situations the role primacy approach impedes, rather than
   facilitates, an understanding of our environment. Our second concern is
   related to insufficient rigor in the application of stakeholder
   analysis. Most stakeholder studies, both theoretical and empirical, fall
   short in the determination of relevant interests and the subsequent
   subdivision of role-based stakeholder groups into rigorously defined
   specific stakeholder groups. Having suggested that the role primacy
   approach to stakeholder definition is less than ideal, we examine the
   extent to which, and the conditions under which, roles are likely to
   determine priorities, and thus, the likelihood of relatively homogeneous
   priorities within role-based stakeholder groups. In addition, we present
   an illustrative empirical analysis of stakeholder group priorities. The
   illustrative study is conducted within the context of intercollegiate
   athletics. Related literature and our empirical results indicate that
   role-based self-interest frequently is not a sufficient ``binding
   tie{''} of stakeholder groups. Given this background, we present an
   alternative approach to stakeholder analysis that borrows heavily from
   the customer segmentation literature of marketing. Our alternative
   approach can accommodate heterogeneous priorities within role-based
   stakeholder group,.},

Year = {2002},
Volume = {87},
Number = {1},

Abstract = {Subjective probability judgments of two mutually exclusive and
   exhaustive events were investigated. Previous research has documented
   binary complementarity, that is, such judgments typically sum up to 1.00
   in accordance with standard probability theories. However, I argue here
   that three hypotheses collectively specify conditions wherein systematic
   binary noncomplementarity is observed. Hypothesis 1 assumes that a
   possibility that an Example X does not belong to a Category C is
   assessed by dissimilarity calculation between X and C. According to
   Hypothesis 2, if X were both similar and dissimilar to C, then the
   probabilities that X belongs to C and that X does not belong to C would
   be judged high enough that their sum exceeds 1.00. Hypothesis 3
   speculates that such normative contradiction occurs contingent upon
   task-dependent subjective weighting of relevant features. Experiments 1
   through 5 confirmed Hypotheses 1 through 3. Analysis of subjective
   weight estimates revealed that the compatibility principle (Slovic,
   Griffin, \& Tversky, 1990) provided a coherent account for such
   violation of probabilistic norms. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science.},

Abstract = {This paper looks at the role played by the ISO 9000 registration process
   in contributing to the knowledge codification within the firms. The ISO
   9000 standards concern the way a company should elaborate a quality
   system by providing guidelines and models. They are considered as a
   code, i.e. a common language, which leads to communication and
   industrial relationship. This paper focuses on how this code might be
   used within the firms to enhance knowledge codification. It explains the
   standards implementation process by studying the three steps needed to
   complete codification within the firm: (1) the starting point of the
   implementation; (2) the subject of the codification, that means the
   material and behavioural characteristics of the production process; (3)
   the impact of the ISO 9000 implementation on knowledge accumulation
   within the firm. This paper addresses the fact that the ISO
   implementation is related to knowledge codification through a learning
   process, which includes both individual and collective knowledge
   conversions. 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {This paper reports on a qualitative field study of 16 hospitals
   implementing an innovative technology for cardiac surgery. We examine
   how new routines are developed in organizations in which existing
   routines are reinforced by the technological and organizational context.
   All hospitals studied had top-tier cardiac surgery departments with
   excellent reputations and patient outcomes yet exhibited striking
   differences in the extent to which they were able to implement a new
   technology that required substantial. changes in the operating-room-team
   work routine. Successful implementers underwent a qualitatively
   different team learning process than those who were unsuccessful.
   Analysis of qualitative data suggests that implementation involved four
   process steps: enrollment, preparation, trials, and reflection.
   Successful implementers used enrollment to motivate the team, designed
   preparatory practice sessions and early trials to create psychological
   safety and encourage new behaviors, and promoted shared meaning and
   process improvement through reflective practices. By illuminating the
   collective learning process among those directly responsible for
   technology implementation, we contribute to organizational research on
   routines and technology adoption.},

   and do employ a variety of individual and collective forms of resistance
   involving dissembling cooperation with change initiatives whilst
   maintaining a distance from them. In accounting for resistance, we note
   the significance of market conditions but focus primarily upon the
   importance of workers' identification with practices that had been
   established earlier when management were content to indulge
   self-managing patterns of work in return for securing required levels of

Journal = {MANAGEMENT SCIENCE},
Year = {2001},
Volume = {47},
Number = {11},
Pages = {1476-1487},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Continuous-time monopolistic models of advertising expenditure that rely
   on strict response concavity have been shown to prescribe eventual
   spending at a constant rate. However, analyses of discrete analogs have
   suggested that S-shaped response (convexity for low expenditure levels)
   may allow for the periodic optima encountered in actual practice.
   Casting the dynamic between advertising and sales in a common format (an
   autonomous, first-order relationship), the present paper explores
   extensions along three dimensions: an S-shaped response function, the
   value of the discount rate, and the possibility of diffusionlike
   response. Supplementing the treatment by Mahajan and Muller (1986), a
   flexible class of S-shaped response models is formulated for which it is
   demonstrated that, in contrast to findings in the literature on
   discretized advertising models, continuous periodic optima cannot be
   supported. Further, a set of conditions on the advertising response
   function are derived, that contains and extends that suggested by
   Sasieni (1971). Collectively, these results both suggest a set of
   baseline properties that reasonable models should possess and cast doubt
   on the ability of first-order models to capture effects of known
   managerial relevance.},

   where will a new organizational form emerge? Using a definition of
   organizational forms as external identity codes, we focus on two answers
   drawn from contemporary organization theory. The first holds that formal
   institutions such as industry associations and standard-setting bodies
   will result in a taken-for-granted organizational form. The second
   answer contends that increasing organizational density (number of
   organizations) will generate a legitimated organizational form. As
   reported here, a historical case study of the disk array market and its
   associated technologies finds both arguments limited. Although
   significant collective activity in association building and standard
   setting occurs among disk array producers, these have not yet led to an
   organizational form. Similarly, an observed trajectory of organizational
   density showing rapid growth followed by stabilization has not yet
   generated an ora ganizational form. In our view, the diversity of
   origins and other activities of those organizations operating in this
   market work against institutionalization of the disk array
   organizational form. We reason that if firms in the market derive their
   primary identities from other activities (implying that there are few
   highly focused firms deriving their primary identity from disk arrays),
   then the disk array producer identity cannot cohere into a code or form.
   This conclusion suggests a respecification of the legitimation component
   of the density-dependent model of organizational evolution.},

Abstract = {Organizational knowledge is much talked about but little understood. In
   this paper we set out to conceptualize organizational knowledge and
   explore its implications for knowledge management. We take on board
   Polanyi's insight concerning the personal character of knowledge and
   fuse it with Wittgenstein's insight that all knowledge is, in a
   fundamental way, collective. We do this in order to show, on the one
   hand, how individuals appropriate knowledge and expand their knowledge
   repertoires, and, on the other hand, how knowledge, in organized
   contexts, becomes organizational. Our claim is that knowledge is the
   individual capability to draw distinctions, within a domain of action,
   based on an appreciation of context or theory, or both. Organizational
   knowledge is the capability members of an organization have developed to
   draw distinctions in the process of carrying out their work, in
   particular concrete contexts, by enacting sets of generalizations whose
   application depends on historically evolved collective understandings.
   Following our theoretical exploration of organizational knowledge, we
   report the findings of a case study carried out at a call centre in
   Panafon, in Greece. Finally, we explore the implications of our argument
   by focusing on the links between knowledge and action on the one hand,
   and the management of organizational knowledge on the other. We argue
   that practical mastery needs to be supplemented by a quasi-theoretical
   understanding of what individuals are doing when they exercise that
   mastery, and this is what knowledge management should be aiming at.
   Knowledge management, we suggest, is the dynamic process of turning an
   unreflective practice into a reflective one by elucidating the rules
   guiding the activities of the practice, by helping give a particular
   shape to collective understandings, and by facilitating the emergence of
   heuristic knowledge.},

Abstract = {This article reports a comparative analysis of reactions to
   organizational politics (OP) in two substantially different cultures,
   Israel and Britain. Two resembling samples of public personnel (n1 = 303
   and n2 = 149 in Israel and Britain, respectively) were used to examine
   employees' perceptions of organizational politics as well as several
   possible work outcomes (e.g. intentions of exit, voice, loyalty,
   neglect, job satisfaction, met expectations, and absenteeism). No
   differences were found between employees' levels of politics perception
   in the two samples. However a between-sample analysis supported the
   hypotheses of differences in reactions to OP across cultures, Generally
   perceptions of organizational politics affected British employees more
   strongly than Israeli. The former responded with higher intentions of
   exit and neglect and lower levels of loyalty, job satisfaction, and met
   expectations. From these results, our main speculation is that reactions
   to OP may depend on cultural variants relevant to the organizational
   environment. Our findings are interpreted mainly in light of the idea of
   cultural differences in perceptions of conflict and politics,
   Accordingly, this study's chief merit is its indication that
   culture-oriented constructs may be useful determinants of reactions to
   OP Other implications of the study are also discussed, as well as
   suggestions for further inquiry into the cultural investigation of OP.},

   responsibly. The argument that complex organizations are therefore
   immoral is considered and rejected. Instead, the paper argues that

   concludes with a discussion of organizational processes and structures

Abstract = {There is currently a lack of empirical work on cross-cultural
   differences in ethical attitudes towards day-to-day management
   decisionmaking in organizations. Work that currently exists in the area
   of management ethics also lacks cultural explanations of differences.
   The present study tries to overcome these deficiencies by providing a
   model of ethical decision-making that is based on cultural antecedents,
   which may explain differences in judgements of ethicality, and
   consequential ethical attitudes or professed behaviour. This article
   reports a 10-nation empirical study that focuses on ethical `grey areas'
   that form part of the day-to-day decision-making in organizations across
   the globe. Countries were selected to represent variation along two
   cultural dimensions of `collectivism-individualism', and `uncertainty
   avoidance'. These dimensions were then used to explain national cultural
   differences in judgements of ethicality of decision items concerned with
   relations with external stakeholders, with the corporation and with the
   group. Results generally confirm that these dimensions, once elaborated
   to consider more recent detailed research, provide explanations for
   differences in ethical attitudes among national groups. This study
   points the way to further investigations based on cultural explanations
   of differences in managers' ethical attitudes and behaviour.},

Abstract = {Intellectual capital statements are `new' forms of reporting whose
   object is knowledge management activities. Based on 17 firms' work to
   develop intellectual capital statements, this paper analyses them as
   managerial technologies making knowledge amenable to intervention.
   Aspects of actor-network-theory are mobilised to suggest that the
   intellectual capital statement is a centre of translation, which
   mobilises knowledge management via three interrelated elements:
   knowledge narratives, visualisations and numbers. Intellectual capital
   statements report on the mechanisms put in place to make knowledge
   manageable. Writing intellectual capital is a local story, which often
   concerns making knowledge collective and a process of allowing it to be
   oriented towards organisational ends. In such a story, knowledge is
   about a firm's capabilities and abilities to make a difference to a
   user. When writing an intellectual capital statement, firms locate
   employees, customers, processes and technologies and orient them towards
   a user. However, the statement as such is a means of `dis-locating'
   knowledge resources making them amenable to intervention. There are
   certain broad types of intervention that allows a classification of
   strategies of intervention to be proposed. These terms are portfolio
   management, improvement activities and productivity. Such forms of
   intervention circumscribe the aspiration to transform knowledge from
   something internal to the person into something that is the effect of a
   collective arrangement. They allow-through intellectual capital
   statements-the dark, tacit knowing of individuals to come into the open
   space of calculation and action at a distance. (C) 2001 Published by

   construed their organization's defining qualities. Intergroup
   comparisons also enhanced the esteem members derived from organizational
   membership, which, in turn, strengthened organizational identification.
   Supervisors reported higher interpersonal cooperation and work effort
   for members whose organizational identification became stronger. The
   results reveal potential outcomes of boundary-spanning work as well as
   how organizational identification processes operate in everyday work

Volume = {28},
Number = {2},
Pages = {239-256},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {This article explores gift-giving practices using data collected through
   interviews in Hong Kong. I argue that Chinese culture promotes the
   familial over the private self and that the attainment of
   family-oriented goals represents an important measure of
   self-realization and self-fulfillment. Although each individual also has
   a private or inner self (chi), it is also subject to the collective
   will. This idea is in keeping with Confucian ideals that encourage the
   individual to focus on developing internal moral constraints and
   conquering selfishness in the pursuit of social propriety. Furthermore,
   the boundaries of the familial self are permeable and may include
   others, such as important romantic partners and, occasionally, close
   friends who become ``like family.{''} In family and like-family
   contexts, reciprocity is discouraged, and there is no need to build
   relationships through gift giving. Our research also suggests, however,
   that there are various gradations of intimacy in gift relationships
   against the backdrop of important cultural rules such as reciprocity,
   sentiment, and face. Using the categories provided by our participants,
   the gift continuum includes ``close friends,{''} ``good friends,{''}
   ``just friends{''}/{''}hi-bye friends,{''} and the ``romantic other.{''}},

   However, collective leadership is fragile. We identify three levels of

   to be mobilized to permit change. Since it is difficult to maintain
   coupling at all levels simultaneously, change tends to proceed

Abstract = {We propose that managers have norms (standards of appropriate behavior)
   for resolving conflict, that these norms are culturally based, and that
   they explain cultural differences in conflict management outcomes. We
   confirm that the traditionally American norms of discussing parties'
   interests and synthesizing multiple issues were exhibited more strongly
   by American managers than by their Hong Kong Chinese counterparts. In
   addition, we confirm that the traditionally Chinese norms of concern for
   collective interests and concern for authority appeared more strongly
   among Hong Kong Chinese managers than among their American counterparts.
   American managers were more likely than Hong Kong Chinese managers, to
   resolve a greater number of issues and reach more integrative outcomes,
   while Hong Kong Chinese managers were more likely to involve higher
   management in conflict resolution. Culture had a significant effect on
   whether parties selected an integrative outcome rather than an outcome
   that involved distribution, compromise, higher management, or no
   resolution at all. Conflict norms explained the cultural differences
   that existed between reaching an integrative outcome and reaching an
   outcome involving distribution, compromise, or higher management;
   however, conflict norms did not fully explain the cultural differences
   that existed between reaching an integrative outcome and reaching no
   resolution. (C) 2001 Academic Press.},

   (military, sports, community, family, and associates) were derived from

Title = {Social approval, values, and AFDC: A reexamination of the illegitimacy
   debate},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY},
Year = {2001},
Volume = {109},
Number = {3},
Pages = {637-672},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {This paper models the fertility decision of individuals who differ in
   their wage rate and their intensity of preferences for rearing children,
   and whose utility of having a child out of wedlock depends on the level
   of ``social approval{''} associated with doing so. This social approval
   in turn is a function of the fraction of individuals in previous
   generations that chose to have children out of wedlock. The model is a
   straightforward extension of the typical rational choice model that
   motivates much of the empirical literature-a literature that has cast
   doubt on a strong link between AFDC and illegitimacy. However, the model
   introduces elements from epidemic models that many have in mind when
   arguing for such a link. As a result, the predictions of this extended
   model are consistent with empirical findings while at the same time
   linking the rise in illegitimacy solely to government welfare programs.
   Specifically, a program similar to AFDC is introduced into an economy
   with low illegitimacy rates, and a transition path to a new steady state
   is calculated. Along the transition path, observed cases of illegitimacy
   are rising among both the poor and nonpoor despite the bet that AFDC
   payments are held constant or even falling. The simultaneous trends of
   declining real welfare benefits and rising illegitimacy over the past
   two and a half decades are therefore not inconsistent with the view that
   illegitimacy might be caused primarily by government welfare policies,
   Although this paper certainly does not claim to prove such a link, it
   does suggest that current empirical approaches have been focused too
   much on an artificially narrow model and have thus given rise to results
   that can be differently interpreted in the context of a more natural
   model. At the same time, the model also suggests that welfare reform
   aimed at reducing the incentives for poor women to have out-of-wedlock
   births may not be as effective as policy makers who believe in a causal
   link between AFDC and illegitimacy might suspect.},

Journal = {MANAGEMENT SCIENCE},
Year = {2001},
Volume = {47},
Number = {6},
Pages = {752-768},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {This paper examines learning curves in the health care setting to
   determine whether organizations achieve performance improvements from
   cumulative experience at different rates. Although extensive research
   has shown that cumulative experience leads to performance improvement
   across numerous contexts, the question of how much of this improvement
   is due to mere experience and how much is due to collective learning
   processes has received little attention. We argue that organizational
   learning processes may allow some organizations to benefit more than
   others from equivalent levels of experience. We thus propose that
   learning curves can vary across organizations engaged in the same
   ``learning task,{''} due to organizational learning effects. To
   investigate this proposition, we investigate cardiac surgery departments
   implementing a new technology for minimally invasive cardiac surgery.
   Data on operative procedure times from a sample of 660 patients who
   underwent the new operation at 16 different institutions are analyzed.
   The results confirm that cumulative experience is a significant
   predictor of learning, and further reveal that the slope of the learning
   curve varies significantly across organizations. Theoretical and
   practical implications of the work are discussed.},

Title = {Review: A cognitive-affective model of organizational communication for

Journal = {MIS QUARTERLY},
Year = {2001},
Volume = {25},

Pages = {251-312},

Abstract = {There are several theories available to describe how managers choose a
   medium for communication. However, current technology can affect not
   only how we communicate but also what we communicate. As a result, the
   issue for designers of communication support systems has become broader:
   how should technology be designed to make communication more effective
   by changing the medium and the attributes of the message itself? The
   answer to this question requires a shift from current preoccupations
   with the medium of communication to a view that assesses the balance
   between medium and message form. There is also a need to took more
   closely at the process of communication in order to identify more
   precisely any potential areas of computer support.
   This paper provides the spadework for a new model of organizational
   communication, and uses it to review existing research, as well as to
   suggest directions for future research and development. Beginning with
   the crucial aspects of action, relationship, and choice, an integrated
   model of how people communicate is developed. This model incorporates
   three basic factors: (1) inputs to the communication process (task,
   sender-receiver distance, and values and norms of communication with a
   particular emphasis on inter-cultural communication); (2) a
   cognitive-affective process of communication; and (3) the communication
   impact on action and relationship. The glue that bonds these factors
   together is a set of communication strategies aimed at reducing the
   complexity of communication.
   The model provides a balance between relationship and action, between
   cognition and affect, and between message and medium. Such a balance has
   been lacking in previous work, and we believe it reflects a more
   realistic picture of communication behavior in organizations. A set of
   propositions generated from the model sets an agenda for studying the
   communication process as well as its inputs and outputs. Furthermore,
   this knowledge of the mechanisms that guide behavior is used to
   demonstrate the potential for developing design principles for future
   communication support systems.},

Abstract = {This article highlights a number of salient aspects of the culture and

   an informed understanding of the way Russians deal with organizations
   and approach leadership style. When appropriate, the clinical paradigm
   is applied, dimensions derived from cultural constructs are utilized,
   and examples are given of the author's Fieldwork in Russian
   organizations. The article starts by examining how a number of
   contextual factors contribute to stoicism as a typical Russian character
   trait and make for a collectivist outlook The implications of Russian
   child-rearing and educational practices are then discussed and the
   article analyses the development of a `false self' - a public self that
   is split from the true private self - particularly during the Soviet
   era. Other themes explored include emotional expressiveness, a
   particularistic outlook toward other people, Oblomovism and oscillation
   between order and disorder The destructive bureaucracy in Russia is
   shown to be a social defence; the Czar legacy and the wish for strong
   leadership are also analysed. The article ends by making a number of
   general comments about leadership and organizational practices in the
   context of stimulating the transformation processes that have recently
   taken place in Russia.},

Journal = {ORGANIZATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2001},
Volume = {12},
Number = {3},
Pages = {372-388},
Month = {MAY-JUN},
Abstract = {This paper examines how a collaborative effort between the private and
   public sectors, called the Derivatives Policy Group (DPG), helped shape
   current regulation of financial innovation. In 1994 and 1995, this group
   of six large financial firms developed procedures for risk management,
   internal controls, and reporting for largely unregulated areas of
   finance, in cooperation with the United States Securities and Exchange
   Commission and Commodity Futures Trading Commission. The process
   succeeded despite strong competition among the firms themselves and
   incentives for both the public and private sectors to resort to
   adversarial lobbying and legal challenges. The Derivatives Policy Group
   was a path-setting event in the development of flexible regulation of
   financial innovation that is now the norm for related policy making.
   The case is important in and of itself-the financial markets are a major
   concern of national and international economic policy-but here we treat
   it as an instance of a larger class of problems. Organizational science
   constantly encounters settings that involve numerous participants who
   compete or have histories of conflicts; who are interdependent, and
   collectively would gain (and even individually gain long term) by
   cooperating rather than competing on an issue; who fall under different
   governance systems; and who try as a group to design rules and
   principles governing their behavior. Four factors appear repeatedly in
   the research on the success or failure of such arrangements. These are
   (1) the initial dispositions toward cooperation, (2) the extant issues
   and incentives, (3) leadership, and (4) the number and variety of
   organizations involved. This paper focuses on how these factors shaped
   the development and consequences of the Derivatives Policy Group, and
   the general implications of this process for interorganizational
   cooperation.},

Title = {The community dynamics of entrepreneurship: The birth of the American
   film industry, 1895-1929},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BUSINESS VENTURING},
Year = {2001},
Volume = {16},
Number = {3},

Abstract = {This paper provides insight for practitioners by exploring the
   collective process of entrepreneurship in the context of the formation
   of new industries. In contrast to the popular notions of
   entrepreneurship, with their emphasis on individual traits, we argue
   that successful entrepreneurship is often not solely the result of
   solitary individuals acting in isolation. In many respects,
   entrepreneurs exist as part of larger collectives. First and foremost,
   there is the population of organizations engaging in activities similar
   to those of the entrepreneurs exist, which constitute a social system
   that can affect entrepreneurial success. In addition, there is also a
   community of populations of organizations characterized by
   interdependence of outcomes. Individual entrepreneurs may be more
   successful in the venturing process if they recognize some of the ways
   in which their success may depend on the actions of entrepreneurs
   throughout this community. Thus, we urge practitioners and theorists
   alike to include a community perspective in their approach to
   entrepreneurship. We also suggest that one way of conceptualizing the
   community of relevance might be in terms of populations of organizations
   that constitute the value chain. For example, in the early film industry
   a simple value chain with three functions-production, distribution and
   exhibition-is a convenient heuristic for considering what populations of
   organizations might be relevant. As we show in our case study of that
   industry, a community model offers insights into the collective nature
   of entrepreneurship and the emergence of new industries.
   Our basic thesis is that the role of entrepreneurship in the creation of
   new industries can be conceptualized in terms of the dynamics of a
   community of organizational populations. At least three implications of
   this view may be important for practitioners. First, the kind of
   widespread and fundamental economic and social change that has often
   been linked with entrepreneurship requires a variety of behaviors. While
   most definitions of entrepreneurship have recognized that
   entrepreneurship requires the introduction of innovation, they have
   tended to ignore the importance of behaviors that subsequently support
   that innovation. To encompass these important behaviors, we believe that
   a broad definition of entrepreneurial behaviors is justified. To capture
   this, the framework of entrepreneurial behaviors that we develop
   includes the variety of behaviors that are important to the success of a
   collective process of entrepreneurship. We believe that recognition of a
   variety of different behaviors that are important to the success of the
   entrepreneurial process can help practicing entrepreneurs to understand
   more fully the complex dynamics of new industry creation. In terms of
   our framework, the range of behaviors of potential importance to
   entrepreneurship includes all of the following: creating a firm that
   innovates, creating a new business that imitates the practices of
   others, innovating within an existing business, and imitating by
   creating change in an existing business. in addition, we recognize that
   the kinds of innovative change that support entrepreneurship in the
   context of new industry creation are not narrowly technological; other
   kinds of product and service changes as well as administrative
   innovations may also be relevant.
   Second, entrepreneurship in one part of the community often creates the
   opportunity for entrepreneurial activity elsewhere in the community. For
   example, the founding of movie palaces did not begin until feature
   length films appeared. The challenge for entrepreneurs is to recognize
   these opportunities and act on them. Third, and related the long-term
   success of entrepreneurial behaviors in one population of the community
   frequently requires that supportive entrepreneurial behaviors occur in
   other populations in the community. For example, the success of feature
   length films was hastened by the development of distribution
   organizations to replace traveling shows and localized markets. Their
   success was also hastened by the movement away from nickelodeons towards
   larger, more comfortable exhibition out lets, such as theaters and show
   palaces. When the interdependence among populations in the community is
   stated this way, another challenge to entrepreneurs becomes clear: the
   facilitation and encouragement of supportive behaviors in other
   populations.
   We are not the first to propose that the community is important, but we
   contribute to this idea by showing in aspecific context how various
   types of behaviors interact and ultimately promote entrepreneurship
   throughout the community. Our contribution for practitioners is twofold.
   We would urge practitioners to consider the variety of behaviors
   necessary to create, reinforce, and maintain fundamental and widespread
   change. Further, we would suggest that practitioners consider how
   activities in a broad community of organizations can set the stage for
   entrepreneurship and have a high impact on its ultimate success or
   failure. Thus, we would suggest that practitioners who seek to innovate
   should search broadly for opportunities and understand the importance of
   relations with businesses elsewhere in the community. The success of
   their entrepreneurial efforts may depend on the occurrence of supportive
   entrepreneurial changes in those businesses as well. Their ability to do
   this will be enhanced by a broad understanding of entrepreneurial
   behaviors and sensitivity to the opportunities that their
   entrepreneurial behaviors may create for others. (C) 2000 Elsevier

Abstract = {Results of this experiment demonstrate that individualists and
   collectivists react differently to minority influence, Based on the
   distinction between objectivity and preference norms in the minority
   influence literature, we hypothesize that individualism and collectivism
   influence (A) responses to minority influence (focusing on the target of
   influence) and (B) effectiveness of minority influence (focusing on the
   influence agent). Our results replicate past research and demonstrate
   improved decision quality for individuals exposed to a minority
   perspective. Moreover, minority influence targets with high horizontal
   individualism and low horizontal collectivism made higher quality
   decisions. Influence targets with high vertical collectivism
   demonstrated higher quality decisions when the influence agent held a
   high status position in the group. Results also demonstrate that
   influence agents with high vertical individualism experienced less role
   stress than those with low vertical individualism. Finally, influence
   agents with low role stress were more effective in influencing the
   decision making of others. We discuss our findings in terms of boundary
   conditions to the minority influence process. (C) 2000 Academic Press.},

Abstract = {Even if there were widespread cross-cultural agreement on the normative

   managing corporate ethics, multinational businesses risk failure in
   pursuing the ostensible goals of corporate ethics initiatives. Pursuing
   shared ethical goals by means of culturally inappropriate management
   practices, in short, can undermine the effectiveness of ethics
   management efforts. This article explicates how several important
   dimensions of culture can influence the effectiveness of common ethics
   initiatives, and recommends the development and application of a

Abstract = {This paper is based on the idea that for each partner in a marriage,
   there are two distinct types of leisure. One type is each person's
   independent (or private) leisure, and the other type is spousal leisure,
   whose importance has long been emphasized in the literature of
   psychology. While each type of leisure is unobservable (only total
   leisure is observed), it is shown that the recent collective models of
   the intrahousehold allocation initiated by Chiappori can be extended to
   identify each type of leisure up to an additive constant. In particular,
   the effects of each member's wage, household unearned income, and
   extrahousehold environmental parameters on the independent and spousal
   leisure and on the sharing rule are fully identified. The observational
   requirement here is the same as in other studies, namely, the
   observation of individual labor supply, individual wages, household
   unearned income, one assignable good, and consumption expenditure at the

Abstract = {This study deals with the process of introducing total quality
   programmes in two metallurgical industry firms in which managers, unions
   representatives and workers actively participated through a network in
   which alliances were made by translating the interests of each party.
   The emergence of this network is put into context by considering
   workers' gains and losses. Based on the actor-network theory of
   innovation, the article describes the intentional creation and diffusion
   of innovation through cooperation and the resistance that took shape
   among certain groups of workers in each plant. The workers opposed to
   the network must have a high degree of autonomy in relation to the joint
   strategy of regulating the innovation process so that they can impose
   their conditions for integration into the network There is a strong
   association between the role of the trade union in the innovation
   process and the achievement of cooperation at the shopfloor level, but
   resistance gives way to another intermediary figure - the work group -
   which resists enrolling in the collective project.},

Abstract = {Arguments about constitutive and sociopolitical legitimation of
   organizational forms are applied to studying the evolutionary dynamics
   of the Bulgarian newspaper industry as it transitioned through multiple
   political and institutional environments. The notion of re-legitimation
   is advanced in the context of comparing the cognitive diffusion of the
   organizational form prior to the Communist takeover in 1946, and its
   revival in the collective memory of the public after 1989. Variation in
   the rate of organizational founding is also linked empirically to the
   strength of political turbulence. Violent political conflict deters new
   foundings, while institutionally mediated political activism has a
   positive effect on the rate of organizational entry.},

Abstract = {Globalization has hastened the growth of buyer-driven commodity chains
   that connect advanced country marketing or retail companies with
   contractors manufacturing in low-cost, developing countries. Allegations
   of labour exploitation have been levelled at the global firms for
   turning a blind eye to their contractors' labour practices. In response,
   some firms have implemented codes of practice. This paper focuses on the
   operation of these codes in two leading athletic shoe buyer-driven
   chains and their contractor plants in Southern China. The codes are
   administered differently by the two firms, encouraging a less
   authoritarian, more human-resource-oriented approach at the two plants
   associated with the larger and more successful global firm.
   Nevertheless, employment conditions at all four plants meet the
   requirements of the corporate codes of practice. The one major exception
   relates to worker representation and collective bargaining. While the
   current international context is conducive to upholding labour standards
   and improving employment relations, Chinese national and local
   institutional contexts limit this tendency. Consequently, workers remain
   in a vulnerable position. The paper concludes by arguing that although
   present structural tendencies favour increases in worker stability and
   power, institutional supports are needed to continuously improve
   employment relations and labour standards.},

Title = {Culture and entrepreneurial potential: A nine country study of locus of
   control and innovativeness},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BUSINESS VENTURING},
Year = {2001},
Volume = {16},
Number = {1},
Pages = {51-75},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Entrepreneurship research has identified a number of personal
   characteristics believed to be instrumental in motivating
   entrepreneurial behavior. TWO frequently cited personal traits
   associated with entrepreneurial potential are internal locus of control
   and innovativeness. Internal locus of control has been one of the most
   studied psychological traits in entrepreneurship research, while
   innovative activity is explicit in Schumpeter's description of the
   entrepreneur. Entrepreneurial traits have been studied extensively in
   the United States. However, cultural studies and studies in non-U.S.
   contexts are rave and in most cases limited to comparisons between one
   or two countries or cultures. Thus the question is raised: do
   entrepreneurial traits vary systematically across cultures and if so,
   why?
   Culture, as the underlying system of values peculiar to a specific group
   or society, shapes the development of certain personality traits and
   motivates individuals in a society to engage in behaviors that may not
   be evident in other societies. Hofstede's (1980) extensive culture
   study, leading to the development of four culture dimensions, provide a
   clear articulation of differences between countries in values, beliefs,
   and work roles. Although Hofstede did not specify the relationship
   between culture and entrepreneurial activity per se, his culture
   dimensions are useful in identifying key aspects of culture related to
   the potential for entrepreneurial behavior.
   In this paper we offer several hypotheses about the relationship between
   two of Hofstede's culture dimensions and psychological traits associated
   with entrepreneurial potential. We expect that an internal locus of
   control orientation is more prevalent in individualistic cultures than
   in collectivistic cultures. Likewise. we expect that an innovative
   orientation is more prevalent in low uncertainty avoidance cultures than
   in high uncertainty avoidance cultures. However, since neither internal
   locus of control nor innovativeness alone is sufficient to explain
   entrepreneurial motivation, we also hypothesize that individuals with
   both an internal locus of control and innovative orientation should
   appear more frequently in highly individualistic and low uncertainty
   cultures.
   These hypotheses were tested on a sample of over 1,800 responses to a
   sun ey of third- and fourth-year students at universities in;nine
   countries. Eighteen items in the survey instrument were used to
   construct scales for innovativeness and locus of control. Items for the
   innovativeness scale were adapted from the Jackson Personality Inventory
   while items used for the locus of control scale were adapted from
   Rotter's I-E scale.
   The results of this exploratory study support the proposition that some
   cultures are more conducive for entrepreneurship than others. In
   individualistic cultures rye found an increased likelihood of an
   internal locus of control orientation. There was also support for the
   hypothesis that an entrepreneurial orientation, defined as internal
   locus of control combined with innovativeness, is more likely in
   individualistic, low uncertainty avoidance cultures than in
   collectivistic, high uncertainty avoidance cultures.
   Culture, it appears, may condition potential for entrepreneurship!,
   generating differences across national and regional boundaries. One
   tentative conclusion is that a ``supportive{''} national culture will,
   ceteris paribus, increase the entrepreneurial potential of a country
   This suggests that in addition to support from political, social, and
   business leaders, there needs to be a supportive culture to cultivate
   the mind and character of the potential entrepreneur. To be motivated to
   act, potential entrepreneurs must perceive themselves as capable and
   psychologically equipped to face the challenges of a global, competitive
   marketplace. Business education can play an important role in this
   regard by providing nor only the technical tools (i.e. accounting,
   marketing, finance etc.), brit by also helping to reorient individuals
   toward self reliance. independent action, creativity, and flexible
   thinking.
   This study examines only two entrepreneurial traits (innovativeness and
   internal locus of control) and only one of the many contextual factors
   (culture) which may explain differences among countries in the raze of
   new venture formation. Future research should expand this investigation
   to include other traits associated with entrepreneurial behavior as well
   as the effect of other contextual factors such as education system,
   political economy, and stage of economic development. (C) 2000 Elsevier

Abstract = {One potentially powerful way of organizing in the new Internet world is
   through the medium of the virtual Internet community. An effectively
   managed virtual community provides economic gains to the community
   organizer and to its members. We attempt to build theory grounded in the
   study of TimeZone.com, a virtual Internet community devoted to
   wristwatch hobbyists and enthusiasts. We argue that a member's off-site
   communication, experience, perceived value of site management, content,
   and collectively held knowledge are positively associated with a
   member's e-based economic transactions within this virtual community.
   Building on our theorizing attempts at the individual level, we develop
   propositions at the organizational level that relate characteristics of
   virtual Internet communities (membership size, scalability, and level of
   site management) to commercial success. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Inc.

Abstract = {In the current political economic environment there is pressure to
   reduce and reorient public agency involvement in agricultural economic
   research and information services. Efforts to evaluate the effectiveness
   of public investments and enhance sectoral coherence through
   exploitation of institutional complementarity are constrained by weak
   understanding of how economic information is produced, processed and
   circulated. In this paper, we locate the centers of analytic competence
   and analyze supply of agricultural economic advisory services through
   development of an information accounting framework. We focus on the
   relative contributions of public agencies, commercial firms, collective
   organizations, and informal networks in order to identify organizational
   structures and institutional arrangements of coordination in the
   agricultural economy. The observed division of labor in information
   systems reflects the heterogeneous distribution and strategic choices of
   actors with respect to internal analytic competencies. Decision makers
   in agricultural businesses are heavily dependent on the services of a
   diverse range of intermediaries who perform information translation and
   customization functions. These intermediaries rely heavily on largely,
   but not exclusively, publicly supplied data and information inputs. This
   strongly linear aspect of agricultural economic information systems is
   identified as a component subsystem within the larger and more highly
   interconnected system of innovation. The dominant role of public
   agencies in economic information systems suggests that they currently
   perform highly valuable coordinating functions in agriculture. While
   commercial and collective organizations make important contributions and
   could be mobilized to assume broader responsibility, there are Likely to
   be Limitations to substitutability based on the classic (but still fully
   relevant) problem of private underinvestment in information. (C) 2001

Abstract = {This research examines the ability of six popular Web search engines,
   individually and collectively, to locate Web pages containing common
   marketing/management phrases. We propose and validate a model for search
   engine performance that is able to represent key patterns of coverage
   and overlap among the engines.
   The model enables us to estimate the typical additional benefit of using
   multiple search engines, depending on the particular set of engines
   being considered. It also provides an estimate of the number of relevant
   Web pages not found by any of the engines. For a typical
   marketing/management phrase we estimate that the ``best{''} search
   engine locates about 50\% of the pages, and all six engines together
   find about 90\% of the total.
   The model is also used to examine how properties of a Web page and
   characteristics of a phrase affect the probability that a given search
   engine will find a given page. For example, we find that the number of
   Web page links increases the prospect that each of the six search
   engines will find it. Finally, we summarize the relationship between
   major structural characteristics of a search engine and its performance

Abstract = {When faced with a global IT infrastructure transition project, Xerox
   managers decided to launch a knowledge-sharing initiative called the
   Transition Alliance. When fully functional, the Alliance comprised fifty
   If professionals responsible for managing 70,000 desktop workstations,
   nearly 1,200 servers, and networking hardware on five continents. Storck
   and Hili observed that community members provided high-quality,
   validated solutions, handled unstructured problems well, and dealt
   effectively with new developments in hardware and software. The authors
   also point out that the motivation for learning and developing at an
   individual level seemed greater in this community structure than in
   other organizational forms, which has important implications for the
   longer-term job performance of the participants.
   The Alliance was more than simply a group that mel occasionally to
   discuss common issues related to a single functional or professional
   area, it had a defined relationship to formal organizational objectives
   yet was not formally required to report back to headquarters on its
   activities. Within the Alliance, the communication repertoire was built
   upon the leadership training required for all Xerox employees. Work
   processes that developed within the Alliance supplemented those used
   elsewhere in the organization. Handling action items, creating meeting
   agendas, and developing other processes were evidence of the
   self-directed nature of the group and provided a context for
   communication.
   Storck and Hill identified six guiding principles that were instrumental
   to Alliance success and are applicable whenever circumstances require
   organizational learning:
   Design an interaction format that promotes openness and allows for
   serendipity.
   Build upon a common organizational culture.
   Demonstrate the existence of mutual interests after the initial success
   at resolving issues and achieving corporate goals.

Abstract = {A UK manufacturer introduced a common model of teamworking which
   achieved quite different performance results in wire-mills and roperies.
   Survey data (n = 231) showed higher job-related strain and lower job
   satisfaction in the wire-mills, where teamworking was not a success,
   Findings indicated that the differences in employee wellbeing could be
   accounted for by contrasting levels of process interdependence in the
   two production areas. Teamworking was a success in the roperies where
   process interdependence was high, but not in the wire-mills where there
   was a mismatch between this production process characteristic and a
   team-based form of work organization. interactions between
   interdependence and autonomy were also found, such that higher autonomy
   had a positive impact only for those working in low interdependence
   processes, The unintended consequence of teamworking under low
   interdependence is to create winners and losers, as individual
   team-members take on responsibilities of the team as a whole.},

   experience faster reversals. Collectively, our findings show that past

Abstract = {The topic of power has not featured strongly in debates about
   organizational learning, a point that is illustrated in a discussion of
   influential studies of teamworking. Despite the insights that such
   studies have provided into the nature of expertise and collaboration
   they have tended not to explore the relevance of issues of hierarchy,
   politics and institutionalized power relations. The paper addresses the
   problem by exploring the links between power, expertise and
   organizational learning Power is analysed both as the medium for, and
   the product of, collective activity. The approach emphasizes how skills
   and imaginations are intertwined with social, technical and
   institutional structures. While studies of teamworking have concentrated
   on situations where imaginations and structures are tightly linked,
   unexpected developments may occur when these relations are loosened.
   Such situations occur when the needs of the moment overshadow normal
   routines and relationships and there is no single overview or centre of
   control. It is suggested that organizational learning can be
   conceptualized as the movement between familiar and emergent activities
   and between established and emergent social relations. Events in a
   two-year action research project are used to illustrate the approach and
   explore episodes of decentred collaboration.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH},
Year = {2000},
Volume = {27},
Number = {2},
Pages = {157-178},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {We argue that a way culture influences decisions is through the reasons
   that individuals recruit when required to explain their choices.
   Specifically, we propose that cultures endow individuals with different
   rules or principles that provide guidance for making decisions, and a
   need to provide reasons activates such cultural knowledge. This
   proposition, representing a dynamic rather than dispositional view of
   cultural influence, is investigated in studies of consumer decisions
   that involve a trade-off between diverging attributes, such as low price
   and high quality. Principles enjoining compromise are more salient in
   East Asian cultures than in North American culture, and accordingly, we
   predict that cultural differences in the tendency to choose compromise
   options will be greater when the decision task requires that
   participants provide reasons. In study 1, a difference between Hong Kong
   Chinese and North American participants in the tendency to select
   compromise products emerged only when they were asked to explain their
   decisions, with Hong Kong decision makers more likely and Americans less
   likely to compromise. Content analysis of participants' reasons
   confirmed that cultural differences in the frequency of generating
   particular types of reasons mediated the difference in choices. Studies
   2 and 3 replicate the interactive effect of culture and the need to
   provide reasons in a comparison of North American versus Japanese
   participants and in a comparison of European-American and Asian-American
   participants, respectively. Studies 4 and 5 found that Hong Kong Chinese
   participants, compared with Americans, evaluate proverbs and the reasons
   of others more positively when these favor compromise. We discuss the
   value of conceptualizing cultural influences in terms of dynamic
   strategies rather than as dispositional tendencies.},

Abstract = {The 1986 Tax Reform Act (TRA) replaced non-synchronous tax year-ends
   with a common October 31 year-end for all mutual funds. After the TRA,
   we find that funds systematically accelerated the sale of losers prior
   to October 31. A similar pattern is not present for funds before the
   TRA, or for other types of institutions either before or after the TRA.
   Examining stock returns in the first year the new TRA regulations became
   fully effective, we find evidence of a strong ``November effect{''} for
   prior losers in which funds collectively had large holdings.
   Interestingly, fund managers appear to have learned from this

Volume = {108},

Abstract = {Much of the literature on consumption smoothing and on risk sharing has
   focused on the ability of the household as a unit to protect its
   consumption. Little is known about the ability of individual members of
   the household to keep consumption smooth over time or relative to other
   members of the household. We use data on adult nutrition in Ethiopia to
   investigate whether individuals are able to smooth their consumption
   over time and within the household. We find that poorer households are
   not able to do so. Furthermore, poor southern households do not engage
   in complete risk sharing; women in these households bear the brunt of
   adverse shocks. This result implies that the collective model of
   household organization, which imposes Pareto efficiency on allocations,
   is rejected for these households. Finally, we obtain estimates of the
   relative Pareto weights in household allocation. We find that a wife's
   relative position is better if customary laws on settlements at divorce
   are favorable or if she comes from a relatively wealthy background and
   that poor southern women have lower Pareto weights in allocation.},

Abstract = {This paper suggests that feelings (moods and emotions) play a central
   role in the leadership process. More specifically it is proposed that
   emotional intelligence, the ability to understand and manage moods and
   emotions in the self and others, contributes to effective leadership in
   organizations. Four major aspects of emotional intelligence, the
   appraisal and expression of emotion, the use of emotion to enhance
   cognitive processes and decision making, knowledge about emotions, and
   management of emotions, are described. Then, I propose how emotional
   intelligence contributes to effective leadership by focusing on five
   essential elements of leader effectiveness: development of collective
   goals and objectives; instilling in others an appreciation of the
   importance of work activities; generating and maintaining enthusiasm,
   confidence, optimism, cooperation,and trust; encouraging flexibility in
   decision making and change; and establishing and maintaining a
   meaningful identity for an organization.},

Abstract = {The authors examine the extent to which cultural orientation influences
   country of origin effects on product evaluations in two countries (Japan
   and the United States). Subjects were given attribute information about
   a mountain bike made in either japan or the United States. The target
   product was described as either superior or inferior to competition.
   Respondents in Japan evaluated the product that originated in the home
   country (versus foreign country) more favorably regardless of product
   superiority. In contrast, respondents in the United States evaluated the
   product that originated in the home country more favorably only when the
   product was superior to competition. The authors explain these findings
   on the basis of the cultural psychological principles of individualism
   and collectivism. Specifically, the authors show that the vertical
   dimension of individualism and collectivism explains country of origin
   effects. The authors also discuss implications for global marketing
   strategies featuring country of origin.},

Abstract = {This study examined how cultural differences and efficacy perceptions

   higher control mitigated the effects of demands on psychological health
   symptoms and turnover intentions only among American bank tellers
   reporting high job self-efficacy. Among American tellers reporting low
   job self-efficacy, perceived control exacerbated the effects of demands.
   However, in a matched Hong Kong sample, collective efficacy interneted
   in the same way with control and demands as job self-efficacy had in the
   American sample.;These differences appear to be explained by the
   individual attributes of idiocentrism and allocentrism that are linked

   observers' reports of work group mood with self-reported measures from

   categories, and observers' reports of work group mood were consistent

Abstract = {We propose priority pricing as an on-line adaptive resource scheduling
   mechanism to manage real-time databases within organizations. These
   databases provide timely information for delay sensitive users. The
   proposed approach allows diverse users to optimize their own objectives
   while collectively maximizing organizational benefits. We rely on
   economic principles to derive priority prices by modeling the
   fixed-capacity real-time database environment as an economic system.
   Each priority is associated with a price and a delay, and the price is
   the premium (congestion toll resulting from negative externalities) for
   accessing the database. At optimality, the prices are equal to the
   aggregate delay cost imposed on all other users of the database. These
   priority prices are used to control admission and to schedule user jobs
   in the database system. The database monitors the arrival processes and
   the state of the system, and incrementally adjusts the prices to
   regulate the flow. Because our model ignores the operational intricacies
   of the real-time databases (e.g., intermediate queues at the CPU and
   disks, memory size, etc.) to maintain analytical tractability, we
   evaluate the performance of our pricing approach through simulation. We
   evaluate the database performance using both the traditional real-time
   database performance metrics (e.g., the number of jobs serviced on time,
   average tardiness) and the economic benefits (e.g., benefits to the
   organization). The simulation results, under various database workload
   parameters, show that our priority pricing mechanism not only maximizes
   organizational benefits but also outperforms in all aspects of
   traditional performance measures compared to frequently used database
   scheduling techniques, such as first-come-first-served, earliest
   deadline first and least slack first.},

Abstract = {In my early Processing Fads and Fashions: An Organization-Set Analysis
   of Cultural Industry Systems{''} (1972), the middle `'throughput''
   phase, or most organizational aspect of cultural industries, was
   emphasized. In this depoliticized exploration of what Adorno (1991) had
   earlier characterized as the industrialization of high culture, and
   Powdermaker (1950) as Hollywood's ``dream factory,{''} I emphasized the
   key roles of gate keeper and distributor organizations as critical in
   connecting the artist/creators to audience/consumers of mass, or
   ``popular{''} culture (as it had more acceptingly come to be called).
   Altogether, this network of organizations-from creators (artists,
   musicians, actors, writers) and brokers (agents), through the cultural
   product's producers (publishers, studios), distributors (wholesalers,
   theaters), and media outlets-collectively constitute cultural
   industries. This article on industries producing ``cultural
   products{''}-defined as `` `nonmaterial' goods directed at a public of
   consumers, for whom they generally serve an esthetic or expressive,
   rather than a clearly utilitarian function{''} (Hirsch 1972 p.
   641)-appeared at the same time that organizational sociology's focus on
   what became known as the `'production of culture'' took off, and
   continued to flourish into the 1990s (Peterson 1994, Crane 1992).
   How has the study of cultural industries changed over the last
   generation? A simple answer is that the subject-the key role of
   distribution and the importance of organizational middlemen in the
   making and sale of popular culture-remains analytically the same. From
   actors, musicians, and writers; through studios, labels and publishers,
   to videocassettes, movie theaters, record stores, and booksellers (in
   stores or via the Internet)-cultural products how. How this sequence is
   organized and traversed remains a fascinating forest of power plays and
   techniques, employed by role-occupants in the same positions as have
   existed since the advent of mass media. While this substantive field has
   changed little analytically, what we also see is a wondrous expansion in
   the disciplinary approaches being taken to examine the multitude of
   topics available for examination under the broad rubric and framing of
   the term, `'cultural industries.{''} Because I was a graduate student at
   the time (my roommate dared me to submit the ``Processing...{''} paper
   to the American Journal of Sociology), it is a great pleasure to find
   the concept has retained its value for other researchers since that
   time.
   In this article, I will (1) reexamine and discuss the original framing
   of the term cultural industries; (2) briefly review some of the mon
   recent complementary perspectives which expand the possible arenas for
   studying this topic; and (3) append a short note on how the more recent
   inclusion of nonprofit cultural products (e.g., symphonies, museums) in
   this framework poses interesting analytical questions and opportunities.},

Abstract = {Our three-person groups read descriptions of three hypothetical
   candidates for student-body president. Each member of a group received
   more information about one of the candidates, making him or her
   relatively expert about that candidate. The identity of this candidate
   was revealed to members in half of the groups before they read the
   materials (expertise forewarning). For half of the forewarned and the
   not forewarned groups, members' expertise was publicly identified at the
   onset of discussion (expert-role assignment). During collective recall,
   groups mentioned substantially more shared than unshared information.
   This sampling bias favoring shared information was reduced by
   expert-role assignment but not by forewarning. However, forewarning did
   increase the likelihood that unshared information would be retained on a
   written protocol once it was mentioned during discussion. These results
   replicated and extended findings of Stasser, Stewart, and Wittenbaum
   (1995). However, they attributed the role-assignment effect to
   coordinated recall prompted by expert-role enactment, and we found no
   evidence of the kind of division of labor that they proposed. Other
   possible mediating processes for these effects were explored. (C) 2000

   As a corollary, we show that anonymous voluntary bargaining completely
   fails in large groups. Either the difference between the bargaining
   outcome and the status quo vanishes as the size of the group becomes
   larger, or, the bargaining becomes coercive and results in a violation
   of at least some individuals' rights. The result provides a rationale
   for the inherent difficulty of reform in the presence of asymmetric

   therefore have a significant collective effect on innovation,
   productivity, and market structure. Standards are classified into
   product-element and nonproduct categories because the two types arise
   from different technologies and require different formulation and
   implementation strategies. Because standards are a form of technical
   infrastructure, they have considerable public good content. Research

Abstract = {This article describes an holistic model of intervention geared to
   achieving transformational change by interweaving culture and structure
   through the warp and weft of leadership processes. That is, it brings
   together organization design and organization development by advocating
   a culturally sensitive approach to organization structuring. Our
   emphasis is on process throughout and our thesis is based on empirical
   evidence. We undertook a lengthy action research project (which we
   prefer to call ``action ethnography{''}) at a large hospital trust in
   England. In the process of elaborating this field study, we move from an
   organization which was seen to be ``gridlocked{''} and to have ``lost
   its steering capacity{''}, through one which was bringing development
   and design together by way of pilot projects and transitional
   structures, to one where collective dialogue and debate finally led to
   some collective and sensible sensemaking.
   Exploring this relationship between culture and structure enables us to
   put people back into design and with them, their meanings, aspirations
   and assumptions. It also means that we are careful to avoid detailing
   specific design choices or offering organizational archetypes: this
   article is primarily about the process issues that surround redesign
   rather than organization design per se, as indeed any redesign is
   ultimately highly specific and context-driven. Instead, however, we
   articulate a four-phase change model, focusing on the delicate processes
   by which to reframe the culture-structure relationship, enabling an
   organization to move towards fundamental change.},

Abstract = {We show that the community of accounting researchers has not fully
   appreciated the sensitivity of research conclusions to (necessarily)
   subjective research design choices, and that this failure has led to the
   subsequent overgeneralization of early evidence.
   Our analysis is based on a case study that examines the effects of two
   basic research design choices, and subsequent researchers' appreciation
   of the impact of those choices. To enhance our study's accessibility to
   a broad cross-section of the accounting research community, our case
   study focuses on an article that is covered in most accounting doctoral
   programs - the recipient of the second American Accounting Association
   ``Seminal Contribution to Accounting Literature Award{''} Beaver's 1968
   article on the information content of annual earnings announcements
   {[}Beaver, W. (1968). The information content of annual earnings
   announcements. Empirical research in accounting; Selected studies, 1968.
   Supplement to Journal of Accounting Research, 6, 67-92.] Our analysis
   reveals that the research design choices in Beaver's study significantly
   affected the results. Beaver clearly explained these choices, and was
   careful in drawing inferences, Nevertheless, subsequent researchers
   interpreted Beaver's evidence too broadly. Our new empirical evidence
   suggests that the information content inference is much more fragile
   than is generally suspected. We also present citation analyses showing
   that, consistent with the Kuhnian view that adherents of a paradigm tend
   to ignore (later) anomalous evidence, subsequent researchers largely
   overlooked post-Beaver evidence that. was inconsistent with the
   paradigm's interpretation of Beaver's results. The paper concludes with
   a brief consideration of how cognitive biases of individuals, combined
   with biases inherent in the review process and the academy in general,
   foster an environment where the placement of the first research bricks
   affect the whole wall. While the case study focuses on an archival
   empirical financial accounting study, consideration of the effects of
   subjective research design choices and the documented deficiencies in
   the interpretation of research are relevant to empirical accounting
   researchers in general and to critical theorists, as well.
   While accounting scholars `think we understand the impact of research
   design choices, the evidence presented here suggests that we have
   collectively failed to apply this understanding in practice. Such
   failure delays the acquisition of knowledge. This study provides a
   salient demonstration indicating that we must constantly remain on guard
   to recognize the subjective nature of research design choices, to
   consider the likely effects of those choices, and to be cautious in
   drawing generalizations. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {This paper studies repeated communication regarding a multidimensional

   beliefs about the consequences of the various decisions diverge, it is
   shown, under some specific assumptions, that public communication causes
   the disagreement between beliefs either to vanish or to become
   one-dimensional at the limit. Multidimensional disagreement indeed
   allows for many directions of communication, including some that are
   orthogonal to the conflict, along which agents can communicate credibly.
   The possible convergence toward a one-dimensional conflict where no
   further communication takes place may be related to the empirically
   observed geometry of the political conflict in many countries.},

   that Americans will experience greater family demand, which will have
   greater impact on work-family conflict, whereas the Chinese will
   experience greater work demand, which will have the greater impact on
   work-family conflict. The results of a survey of working men and women
   in the two countries generally supported the hypotheses; however, work
   demand did not differ significantly between the two countries and did
   not have a greater effect than family demand on work-family conflict in

Abstract = {Many organizations are made up of other organizations that have decided
   to act collectively - as with research and development consortia,
   industrial alliances, trade associations, and formal political
   coalitions. These collective organizations can be characterized by their
   differing strategies: some are general in scope, while others specialize
   on a more narrow purpose. What explains the prevalence of generalism and
   specialism among collective organizations? We develop an ecological
   model in which collective organizations compete over member
   organizations. Assuming that an organization joins a collective when its
   objectives match that of thr collective, our model predicts a generalism
   bias in the ecology of founding and growth among collective
   organizations. This outcome is predicted to be path dependent, however,
   emerging over time according to relatively minor differences in initial
   conditions. These predictions are supported in an analysis of founding
   and growth rates among US R\&D consortia, and the model helps to account
   for the numbers, sizes, and strategic diversity of these consortia.},

Abstract = {I model people in a coordination game who use a communication network to
   tell each other their willingness to participate. The minimal sufficient
   networks for coordination can be interpreted as placing people into a
   hierarchy of social roles or ``stages{''}: ``initial adopters{''}, then
   ``followers{''}, and so on down to ``late adopters{''}. A communication
   network helps coordination in exactly two ways: by informing each stage
   about earlier stages, and by creating common knowledge within each
   stage. We then consider two examples: first we show that ``low
   dimensional{''} networks can be better for coordination even though they
   have far fewer links than ``high dimensional{''} networks; second we
   show that wide dispersion of ``insurgents{''},:people predisposed toward
   participation, can be good for coordination but too much dispersion can
   be bad.},

Title = {Does cultural socialization predict multiple bases and foci of
   commitment?},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2000},
Volume = {26},
Number = {1},
Pages = {5-30},
Abstract = {Some organizational commitment theorists have proposed that culture is
   an important antecedent to organisational commitment (Meyer \& Allen,
   1991; 1982). This study tests whether individualized measures of power
   distance, collectivism, uncertanity avoidance, and masculinity are
   related to an employee's level of commitment. A nine-factor model of
   commitment is postulated with three bases (affective, continuance, and
   normative commitment) and three foci (organisation, supervisor, and
   workgroup) of commitment. Confirmatory factor analysis provides support
   for the commitment model embodying all bases and foci of commitment.
   Hierarchial regression analysis results also suggest that cultural
   dimensions are significant predictors of multiple bases and foci of
   commitment. Specific significant results include: (1) Power distance is
   related to normative commitment across all foci; (2) Uncertanity
   avoidance is related to continuance commitment across all foci; (3)
   Collectivism is related to continuance across all bases of commitment.

   the theory of individualism (idiocentrism) and collectivism
   (allocentrism) was applied to the model to derive and test specific

Abstract = {While many aspects of the collaborative process have been discussed in
   the management literature, the connection between collaboration and the
   dynamics of institutional fields has remained largely unconsidered. Yet,
   collaboration is an important arena for inter-organizational interaction
   and, therefore, a potentially important context for the process of
   structuration upon which institutional fields depend. In this paper, we
   argue that institutionalization and collaboration are interdependent;
   institutional fields provide the rules and resources upon which
   collaboration is constructed, while collaboration provides a context for
   the ongoing processes of structuration that sustain the institutional
   fields of the participants.},

   hierarchical regressions revealed that interdependence (msk and reward)
   and preference for group work were positively related to group-member
   satisfaction. Consistent with ``supplies-values fit ``framework, the
   interaction of task interdependence and preference for group work was
   significantly related to group-member performance. Implications for the

Journal = {JOURNAL OF CONSUMER PSYCHOLOGY},
Year = {2000},
Volume = {9},
Number = {2},
Pages = {107-115},
Abstract = {This research examines how variations in consumers'
   connectedness-separateness (CS) self-schema, which refers to an
   individual's perceptions of others as an extension of self or of the
   self as distinct from others, may explain cultural and gender-level
   persuasion effects. Results from a cross-cultural experiment demonstrate
   that a connected advertising appeal stressing interdependence and
   togetherness results in more favorable brand attitudes among Chinese and
   women consumers than does a separated appeal stressing independence and
   autonomy. Conversely, a separated appeal results in more favorable
   attitudes among U.S. and male consumers. Most important, the results
   suggest that the interactions detected between ad appeal and culture, as
   well as between ad appeal and gender, are mediated by distinct
   dimensions of consumers' C-S. The self-orientation dimension of C-S is
   shown to account for cultural-level persuasion effects, whereas
   gender-level effects are attributable to the dependence dimension. Thus,
   individual differences in these dimensions compose an important factor
   in explaining cultural and gender variations in consumers' responses.},

Journal = {MANAGEMENT SCIENCE},
Year = {1999},
Volume = {45},
Number = {12},
Pages = {1710-1723},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {As databases grow more prevalent and comprehensive, database
   administrators seek to limit disclosure of confidential information
   while still providing access to data. Practical databases accommodate
   users with heterogeneous needs for access. Each class of data user is
   accorded access to only certain views. Other views are considered
   confidential, and hence to be protected. Using illustrations from health
   care and education, this article addresses inferential disclosure of
   confidential views in multidimensional categorical databases. It
   demonstrates that any structural, so data-value-independent method for
   detecting disclosure can fail. Consistent with previous work for two-way
   tables, it presents a data-value-dependent method to obtain tight lower
   and upper bounds for confidential data values. For two-dimensional
   projections of categorical databases, it exploits the network structure
   of a linear programming (LP) formulation to develop two transportation
   flow algorithms that are both computationally efficient and insightful.
   These algorithms can be easily implemented through two new matrix
   operators, cell-maxima and cell-minima. Collectively, this method is
   called matrix comparative assignment (MCA). Finally, it extends both the
   LP and MCA approaches to inferential disclosure when accessible views
   have been masked.},

Abstract = {Increasing pressure on managing international teams has created a need

   study the cultural context of power distance is examined in relation to
   the status characteristics possessed by group members and their
   influence on group efficacy estimations and performance. Data obtained
   from 288 senior managers coming from England, France, Thailand, and the
   United States were used to test the hypothesis that power distance would
   moderate the influence of member status on collective decisions made by
   a group. Results demonstrate that in high power distance cultures,
   collective judgments of group capability are more strongly tied to
   higher rather than to lower status group members' personal judgments. In
   low power distance cultures, members appear to contribute comparably to
   collective efficacy judgments. The implications of the study are
   discussed in terms of status differentials and group decision making
   across cultures. (C) 1999 Academic Press.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this article is to explore the specific affective
   organization of personal meanings in midlife crisis in men. Midlife
   crisis is described as a process of intensive transition of the self
   including the reinterpretation of time perspective, reevaluation of life
   values and goals, confrontation with death as a personal event in the
   future, and planning of the second half of life. Personal meanings
   referring to past, present, and future were investigated using a
   self-confrontation method that is sensitive to the affective properties
   of individual experiences. The intensity of midlife crisis was
   investigated by means of a Midlife Crisis Scale in a sample of 104 men
   in Poland. Three groups, one high in midlife crisis (N = 27), one medium
   (N = 37), and one low in midlife crisis (N = 40) were compared. It was
   found that the high crisis group had a lower level of affect referring
   to self-enhancement, a lower level of positive affect, and a higher
   level of negative affect than both other groups. Moreover, time
   perspective played a differential role in the organization of the self:
   in an intragroup comparison of the most influential personal meanings,
   the high crisis group showed a higher level of negative affect than
   positive affect for personal meanings referring to the future, but not
   for personal meanings referring to the past and the present. The
   relevance of affective organization for midlife crisis is discussed.},

Journal = {HUMAN RELATIONS},
Year = {1999},
Volume = {52},
Number = {11},
Pages = {1445-1467},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {This paper explores the relationship among three social dilemmas faced
   by organizations wishing to attain and maintain workforce diversity: the
   dilemmas of organizational participation, managerial participation, and
   individual participation. Functional and social category diversity offer
   benefits for organizations (creativity, adaptation and innovation, and
   access to external networks), but there are costs which deter
   organizations from pursuing these benefits. The costs associated with
   organizational participation in diversity initiatives arise because
   managers and their employees perceive organizational conflicts and
   organize their interactions along social identity lines, so that
   temporal traps and collective fences surround diversity. Resolving the
   subordinate dilemmas of managerial and individual participation provides
   the key to resolving the dilemma of organizational participation. Social
   identity theory is used to understand the dilemmas and to develop
   possible resolutions, which should make the benefits of diversity more
   immediately accessible to organizations and society.},

Abstract = {This research incorporates the theory of individualism-collectivism into
   research on accountability in intergroup negotiations. Given that
   accountability is fundamentally a norm enforcement mechanism and that
   norms and standards for behavior vary for individualists and
   collectivists (H. R. Markus \& S. Kitayama, 1991; H. C. Triandis, 1995)
   it was predicted that accountability would differentially affect
   individualists and collectivists in intergroup negotiations. In support
   of this, results from a laboratory study (with Caucasians and Asian
   Americans) and from a judgment study tin the United States and Estonia)
   found that collectivism moderated the effects of accountability on
   negotiators' psychological states, behaviors, and outcomes. In contrast
   to previous research, the results illustrate that accountability does
   not necessarily produce competitive behavior, but rather produces the
   behavior most normative for individuals in their sociocultural
   experience.},

   How are individual resources combined to yield a group response (the
   individual-into-group problem)? What are the implications of empirical
   observations under one set of circumstances for other conditions where
   data do not exist (the sparse data problem)? Several prescriptions for
   how to conduct fruitful group research are contained in the SDS
   tradition: make precise theoretical statements, provide strong and
   competitive tests of theories, and interpret empirical findings in the

Abstract = {The purpose of this article is to analyse the growing interest, in the

   innovation is required to achieve ambitious environmental targets. The
   implementation of this theoretical approach in the end-of-life vehicles
   (ELV) case, which has been the subject of several voluntary agreements
   in Europe, offers a fuller understanding of the characteristics and
   driving forces of the collective innovation process in action, as well
   as the obstacles that have still to be overcome. In particular, we
   explain why monitoring of innovation by the authorities, focusing on
   coordination mechanisms, is a crucial issue on which further research

Abstract = {Concepts that include the participation and empowerment of workers are
   becoming increasingly important nowadays. In many of these concepts, the
   formal responsibility is delegated to teams. Does this imply that the
   normative responsibility for the actions of teams is also delegated? In
   this article we will reflect on the difference between holding a person
   accountable and bearing responsibility. A framework is elaborated in
   order to analyse the accountability and responsibility of teams. In this
   framework, the emergence of a collective mind, and the organisational
   factors that influence the extent to which teams have the possibility of
   acting in a responsible way play an important role. It shows that teams
   can bear responsibilities that could never be carried by a group of
   individuals. The framework is used to analyse two sample cases with
   self-managing teams in production facilities. The authors discuss the
   implications for the theory and practice of self-managing teams and the
   allocation of responsibility between individuals, teams and the

Abstract = {In this paper, we argue that judgment biases in negotiation are
   perpetuated by underlying cultural values and ideals, and therefore,
   certain judgment biases will be more prevalent in certain cultural
   contexts. Based on theory in cultural psychology (Markus \& Kitayama,
   1991; Triandis, 1989), we considered the notion that fixed pie error, a
   judgment bias in which negotiators fail to accurately understand their
   counterparts' interests (Pruitt \& Lewis, 1975; Thompson \& Hastie,
   1990),would be more prevalent at the end of negotiations in the United
   States, an individualistic culture, than Greece, a collectivistic
   culture. The results of a a-week computer-mediated intercultural
   negotiation experiment, which took place between American students in
   Illinois and Greek students in Athens, supported this view. Theoretical
   implications of culture and cognition in negotiation are also discussed.

Abstract = {This article documents the fact that when debtors decide to default on
   their obligations too early, it is in the creditors' collective
   interest, as residual claimants, to make concessions prior to forcing a
   costly liquidation. Symmetrically, when debtors prefer to default at an
   inefficiently late stage, it is in the creditors' interest to propose a
   departure from the absolute priority rule. This article develops a
   continuous time pricing model of dynamic debt restructuring that
   reflects the crucial influence of the two counterparties' relative
   bargaining power. Simple and intuitive path-dependent. pricing formulae
   are derived for equity and debt. The debt capacity as well as the
   evolution of the firm's capital structure throughout its existence is
   provided.},

Abstract = {United States firms collectively spend over \$6.5 billion annually on
   coupon promotions and are becoming increasingly concerned with their
   profitability. FSI (free-standing-insert) data show that coupon duration

   affect coupon profitability. We also provide answers for some empirical
   observations on coupon duration. We explain, for example, why (i) coupon
   duration will vary across firms, such that large market share firms will
   give short-duration coupons and small market share firms will give
   long-duration coupons; (ii) longer coupon duration for one brand will
   increase redemption for coupons of that brand and of a competing brand;
   (iii) coupon duration will affect coupon profitability.},

Abstract = {This study developed and tested the idea that social categorization
   processes help to explain framing effects in social dilemmas, Using
   self-categorization theory, we predicted that members of a collective
   would cooperate more when they faced homogeneous rather than
   heterogeneous resource frames, We manipulated the starting point of
   resources for the members of each of two subgroups making up a larger
   collective in a nested social dilemma. The resources of the subject's
   own subgroup started at the individual, subgroup, or collective level,
   and the resources of the opposing subgroup also started at the
   individual, subgroup, or collective level, The condition in which both
   subgroups' resources began at the collective level was similar to a
   traditional commons dilemma, while the condition in which both
   subgroups' resources began at the individual level was similar to a
   traditional public goods problem, The other conditions were new to this
   research domain. We found higher allocations to the collective account
   when the initial resource location was the same for both subgroups
   (versus different for each subgroup), even when this initial location
   was the subgroup or individual level. Whereas previous explanations for
   framing effects cannot account for these results, social categorization
   processes provide a parsimonious explanation for the observed pattern of
   allocations. (C) 1999 Academic Press.},

Abstract = {This paper subjects a contemporary managerial doctrine, business process
   reengineering (BPR), to rhetorical scrutiny. Finding analytical
   inspiration from the writings of the American literary critic Kenneth
   Burke and adopting an anthropological attitude towards `history', it
   seeks to demystify the appeal of BPR rhetoric as represented in various
   published and unpublished texts. The analysis makes extensive use of
   `sacred' motifs in order to gain `perspective through incongruity and
   expose the secular motives at work in BPR literature. An analogy is
   drawn between ethnographic examples of `amnesia' drawn from the author's
   study of a computer installation and `amnesia writ large' through BPR.
   On the basis of this comparison, it is suggested that BPR can be read as
   offering cathartic absolution of the collective guilt associated with
   information technology mismanagement. Any `doubts' that a managerial
   public may be harbouring are rhetorically harnessed by BPR protagonists
   in their attempts to acquire secular converts. The popularity of BPR may
   now be on the decline but there will be other similarly instrumental
   agendas to replace it in the future to which students of management need
   to be alert.},

Abstract = {In all economies, financial systems perform a basic set of functions,
   which include the need to pool resources, to save and borrow, to make
   payments, and to collect information. And yet, in rich and poor
   communities, the ways in which those needs are met differ greatly. In
   part, this is because traditional financial service firms have found it
   too expensive to serve poor neighborhoods. But it is possible to work
   with less traditional institutions to meet those needs.
   According to the authors, inner cities face two core impediments to
   financial services: lack of economies of scale and lack of good
   information. An inner-city investor with \$500,for instance, does not
   warrant much attention from financial service firms. But 20,000
   parishioners investing \$500 apiece can collectively wield \$10 million.
   By partnering with strong social organizations such as churches,
   financial institutions can benefit both themselves and investors.
   A lack of good information concerning credit histories- a common problem
   in poor communities -also makes low-income customers much less appealing
   to financial institutions. Churches can help close such information gaps
   by vouching for parishioners' reliability.
   There are certainly problems that come with mixing business and
   religion, as the authors concede. Ethical issues, trust issues, and
   issues of experience all come to mind. But understanding that functions
   need to dictate the structure of the financial service sector may be the
   first step toward achieving inner-city prosperity.},

Abstract = {This paper reviews cross-cultural research in management control systems
   (MCS) appearing in English-language journals over the past 15 years. The
   objectives are to examine these studies for their convergence or
   otherwise with respect to the state of our understanding of cultural
   effects on MCS design, and to analyse their theoretical and
   methodological strengths and weaknesses to guide future research. The
   review identifies four major weaknesses seen to apply collectively to
   this research: (i) a failure to consider the totality of the cultural
   domain in theoretical exposition; (ii) a tendency to not consider
   explicitly the differential intensity of cultural norms and values
   across nations; (iii) a tendency to treat culture simplistically both in
   the form of its representation as a limited set of aggregate dimensions,
   and in the assumption of a uniformity and unidimensionality of those
   dimensions; and (iv) an excessive reliance on the value dimensional
   conceptualization of culture, which has produced a highly restricted
   conception and focus on culture, and placed critical limits on the
   extent of understanding derived from the research to date. (C) 1999

Abstract = {This paper examines segregation in American cities from 1890 to 1990.
   From 1890 to 1940, ghettos were born as blacks migrated to urban areas
   and cities developed vast expanses filled with almost entirely black
   housing. From 1940 to 1970, black migration continued and the physical
   areas of the ghettos expanded. Since 1970, there has been a decline in
   segregation as blacks have moved into previously all-white areas of
   cities and suburbs. Across all these time periods there is a strong
   positive relation between urban population or density and segregation.
   Data on house prices and attitudes toward integration suggest that in
   the mid-twentieth century, segregation was a product of collective
   actions taken by whites to exclude blacks from their neighborhoods. By
   1990, the legal barriers enforcing segregation had been replaced by
   decentralized racism, where whites pay more than blacks to live in
   predominantly white areas.},

   data collected from 2,273 U.S. Army soldiers representing 36 companies,
   it was found that both self- and collective efficacy moderated the
   relationship between stressors and strains. Multilevel random
   coefficient model results revealed that respondents with strong
   self-efficacy reacted less negatively in terms of psychological and
   physical strain to long work hours and work overload than did those
   reporting low levels of efficacy. In addition, respondents with high
   levels of self-efficacy responded more positively in terms of job
   satisfaction to tasks with high significance than did those with low
   efficacy. The results also revealed that group-level collective efficacy
   moderated the relationship between work overload and job satisfaction
   and between task significance and organizational commitment. Limitations

Abstract = {In this paper we integrate recent theory and research on the
   self-concept with leadership theory. We conceptualize the self as being
   defined at three levels: the individual, interpersonal, and group
   levels, The effects of the self on information processing and behavior
   are mediated by the working self-concept, which is composed of
   self-views, possible selves, and goals (standards), Leaders are seen as
   producing short-run changes by influencing the working self-concept and
   more enduring changes through the development of chronic schema.
   Subordinates are also seen as influencing leaders' self-schema, both
   individually and collectively. Both practical and theoretical
   implications of this perspective are discussed, (C) 1999 Academic Press.},

Volume = {52},

Pages = {775-804},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {This paper explores the proposition that elements of the work of
   psychiatric services are impossible. The notion of impossibility is
   considered from three perspectives: societal, interpersonal, and
   organizational. Organizational elements of impossibility are evidenced
   in attempts to work with madness, a phenomenon that defies clear
   definition. Resultant confusion in role and task boundaries is
   exacerbated by mad interpersonal interactions. The situation is
   compounded by societal conflicts between the mad and the sane. Attempts
   to house and treat the mad over the past 200 years are reviewed, and
   recent illustrative case material is presented from two community
   treatment teams. It is argued that primarily solution-focused approaches
   to madness have limited success. To acknowledge impossible elements of
   the work may enable psychiatric institutions to be designed in ways that
   help make individual and collective madness more bearable rather than
   something to be controlled and or denied.},

Abstract = {Mary Douglas's cultural theory of grid and group provides a framework
   for the description of three distinct cultural types corresponding to
   three logics for the legitimation of collectivity and collective

   and outsourcing, and the emergence of concerns with cultural control,

Journal = {HARVARD BUSINESS REVIEW},
Year = {1999},
Volume = {77},
Number = {3},
Pages = {96+},
Month = {MAY-JUN},
Abstract = {The selection of a CEO is one of the most important- and risky-events in
   the life of any company. Yet the way CEOs are chosen remains little
   discussed and little understood. The succession process has
   traditionally unfolded behind closed doors - some observers have even
   likened it to the election of a pope.
   To shed light on what works and what doesn't in CEO succession, the
   authors lead a roundtable discussion with five distinguished corporate
   directors: Philip Caldwell, George D. Kennedy, G.G. Michelson, Henry
   Wendt, and Alfred M. Zeien. Collectively, the five directors have
   participated in dozens of successions, either as board members or as
   CEOs.
   In a lively and frank exchange of views and experiences, the roundtable
   participants explore a broad range of questions: What can a company do
   to ensure a successful succession? How should management-development and
   succession processes be managed? How should the board work: with the
   sitting chief executive during the process? What makes for a strong CEO
   candidate? When should outside candidates be considered? How much
   competition should be encouraged among potential CEO candidates? What
   role should executive search firms play? What role should former CEOs
   play after they are succeeded? Their conversation illuminates a
   corporate challenge that is as difficult as it is important.},

Abstract = {Can firms and coevolutionary groups suffer from too much interdependent
   complexity? Is complexity theory an alternative explanation to
   competitive selection for the emergent order apparent in coevolutionary
   industry groups? The biologist Stewart Kauffman suggests a theory of
   complexity catastrophe offering universal principles explaining
   phenomena normally attributed to Darwinian natural selection theory.
   Kauffman's complexity theory seems to apply equally well to firms in
   coevolutionary pockets. Based on complexity theory, four kinds of
   complexity are identified. Kauffman's ``NK{[}C] model{''} is positioned
   ``at the edge of chaos{''} between complexity driven by ``Newtonian{''}
   simple rules and rule-driven deterministic chaos. Kauffman's insight,
   which is the basis of the findings in this paper, is that complexity is
   both a consequence and a cause. Multicoevolutionary complexity in firms
   is defined by moving natural selection processes inside firms and down
   to a ``parts{''} level of analysis, in this instance Porter's value
   chain level, to focus on microstate activities by agents. The
   assumptions of stochastically idiosyncratic microstates and coevolution
   in firms are analyzed. Competitive advantage, as a dependent variable,
   is defined in terms of Nash equilibrium fitness levels. This allows a
   translation of Kauffman's theory to firms, paying particular attention
   to (1) how value chain landscapes might be modeled, (2) assumptions
   underlying Kauffman's models makings them amenable to firms, and (3) a
   delineation of seven of Kauffman's computational experiments. As part of
   the translation, possible parallels between the application of
   complexity catastrophe theory to coevolutionary pockets and studies by
   institutional theorists and social network analysts are discussed. The
   models derive from spin-glass microstate models resulting in Boolean
   games. Kauffman's Boolean statistical mechanics is introduced in
   developing the logic underlying the somewhat simplified NK{[}C] model.
   The model allows the use of computational experiments to better
   understand how the dependent variable-value chain fitness-is affected by
   changes in the number of internal interdependencies K, the number of
   coevolutionary links with opponents C, the size of the coevolutionary
   pocket S, and the number of simultaneous adaptive changes, among other
   things. Various computational experiments are presented that suggest
   strategic organizing approaches most likely to foster competitive
   advantage. High or low Nash equilibrium fitness levels an shown to
   result from internal and external coevolutionary densities as a function
   of links among value chain competencies within a firm and between a firm
   and an opponent. Complexity phenomena appear to suggest a number of
   expected land thus validating) and surprising strategies with respect to
   complex organizational interdependencies. For example, moderate
   complexity fares best and external coevolutionary complexity sets an
   upper bound to advantages likely to be gained from internal complexity.
   Various complexity ``lessons{''} are discussed. Models such as the
   NK{[}C] could offer insights into strategic organizing.},

Abstract = {The development of a professional code of ethics should provide an

   the first step in developing communication, debate, and hopefully,
   agreement about the social responsibility of the marketing discipline.
   It is important to note that the AMS code was not developed to punish
   wrongdoers but to provide a positive guide to help marketing educators
   understand how their actions may be viewed by society. It is an attempt
   to establish standards that are collectively viewed as important to the

Abstract = {We study a longitudinal sample of over one million French workers from
   more than five hundred thousand employing firms. We decompose real total
   annual compensation per worker into components related to observable
   employee characteristics, personal heterogeneity, firm heterogeneity,
   and residual variation. Except fur the residual, all components may be
   correlated in an arbitrary fashion. At the level of the individual, we
   find that person effects, especially those not related to observables
   like education, are a very important source of wage variation in France.
   Firm effects, while important, are not as important as person effects.
   At the level of firms, we find that enterprises that hire high-wage
   workers are more productive but not more profitable. They are also more
   capital and high-skilled employee intensive. Enterprises that pay higher
   wages, controlling for person effects, are more productive and more
   profitable. They are also more capital intensive but are not more
   high-skilled labor intensive. We find that person effects explain about
   90\% of inter-industry wage differentials and about 75\% of the
   firm-size wage effect while firm effects explain relatively little of
   either differential.},

Title = {Strategy as strategic decision making},
Journal = {SLOAN MANAGEMENT REVIEW},
Year = {1999},
Volume = {40},
Number = {3},
Pages = {65+},
Month = {SPR},
Abstract = {In high-velocity, intensely competitive markets, traditional approaches
   to strategy give way to ``competing on the edge{''} - creating a flow of
   temporary, shifting competitive advantages. The author's research on
   entrepreneurial and diversified businesses demonstrates that successful
   firms in these markets have fast, high-quality, and widely supported
   strategic decision-making processes. These firms use four approaches to
   create strategy:
   1. Management teams build collective intuition through frequent meetings
   and real-time metrics that enhance their ability to see threats and
   opportunities early and accurately less successful teams rarely meet
   with their colleagues in a group and make fewer and larger strategic
   choices, relying on market analyses and future trend projections that
   are idiosyncratic to the decision.
   2. Executives stimulate conflict by assembling diverse teams,
   challenging them through frame-breaking tactics, such as scenario
   planning and role playing, and stressing multiple alternatives to
   improve the quality of decision making. less successful performers move
   quickly to a few alternatives, analyze the best ones, and make a speedy
   decision.
   3. Effective decision makers locus on maintaining decision pace, not
   pushing decision speed. They sustain momentum through the methods of
   rime pacing, prototyping, and consensus with qualification. ineffective
   decision makers stress the rarity and significance of strategic choices.
   Because the decision then looms large, they oscillate between
   procrastination and ``shotgun{''} strategic choices against deadlines.
   4. Managers on successful teams rake a negative view of politicking.
   Their perspective is collaborative, not competitive. These teams
   emphasize common goals, clear turf, and having fun. less effective
   decision makers have a competitive orientation and lack a sense of
   teamwork.
   Together these approaches direct executive attention reward strategic
   decision making as the cornerstone of effective strategy.},

Abstract = {Gibbons argues persuasively that economic modeling offers a useful set
   of tools that noneconomists may employ to good effect in their research
   on organizations. His arguments are even more persuasive if it is
   understood that this brand of modeling lends itself naturally to one of
   the key theoretical problems facing such researchers-the need for a
   theory of aggregation, sometimes called a theory of action. Such a
   theory is necessary to link the behavior of individuals with properties
   of collectivities, such as corporations. Gibbons demonstrates that
   organizations populated with utility-maximizing actors can nevertheless
   be characterized by political chicanery, foolishness, and structural
   inertia, all of which can be seen as kinds of ``organizational
   messes.{''} So building a macro theory on rationalist assumptions does
   not require one to ignore many of the phenomena that have interested
   organizations researchers in the past.{*}},

Abstract = {The effect of culture on work values has been studied in a number of
   ways, largely from a western perspective. Studies have predominantly
   employed questionnaires as the principal agent of data collection. Yet
   the Confucian work ethic attributes greater emphasis to collectivist
   values which bear more centrally on personal relationships. This
   research used discourse analysis in order to try to identify the
   implicit features of cultural values as they affected the transmission
   of financial information, a problem highlighted by the Asian currency
   crisis in 1997/98.
   The international hotel industry operates in a multicultural environment
   where very often foreign operators manage locally owned premises. In
   these circumstances, budgetary planning and control is an important
   mechanism. A sample of the interactions between 18 hotel general
   managers and their financial controllers were studied in Hong Kong.
   Financial controllers are already subject to a number of role conflicts
   and it was found that these may be exaggerated by culture.
   Chinese financial controllers seem to distort the outputs of budgetary
   planning and control processes in recognition of important
   organizational relationships. It is suggested that recognizing the
   direction and effect of these relationships has implications for
   leadership and performance judgements generally.},

Journal = {ADMINISTRATIVE SCIENCE QUARTERLY},
Year = {1999},
Volume = {44},

Pages = {57-81},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {This paper describes a qualitative study of how people use their time at
   work, why they use it this way, and whether their way of using time is
   optimal for them or their work groups. Results of a nine-month field
   study of the work practices of a software engineering team revealed that
   the group's collective use of time perpetuated its members' ``time
   famine,{''} a feeling of having too much to do and not enough time to do
   it. Engineers had difficulty getting their individual work done because
   they were constantly interrupted by others. A crisis mentality and a
   reward system based on individual heroics perpetuated this disruptive
   way of interacting. Altering the way software engineers used their time
   at work, however, enhanced their collective productivity. This research
   points toward a ``sociology of work time,{''} a framework integrating
   individuals' interdependent work patterns and the larger social and
   temporal contexts. The theoretical and practical implications of a
   sociology of work time are explored.{*}},

Abstract = {Do cultural values influence the manner in which people cooperate with
   one another? This study assessed cultural characteristics of individuals
   and then related these characteristics to cooperative behavior in social
   dilemmas. Participants were assessed for their degree of vertical and
   horizontal individualism and collectivism, cultural values identified by
   Triandis (1995), They made choices in either a single-group or an
   intergroup social dilemma. The single-group dilemma entailed a
   three-person dilemma; the intergroup dilemma was identical but added
   subgroup competition, i,e., an opposing three-person group. The results
   indicated an interaction between cultural characteristics and type of
   dilemma for cooperation. The single-group versus intergroup effect
   reported by Bornstein and Ben-Yossef (1994) was replicated, but only for
   vertical individualists. The vertical individualists were least
   cooperative in the single-group dilemma but were more cooperative in the
   intergroup dilemma-where cooperation with the group maximized personal
   outcomes. The vertical collectivists were most cooperative in the
   single-group dilemma but were less cooperative in the intergroup
   dilemma-where group defection resulted in maximum group outcomes. The
   horizontal individualists and collectivists exhibited an intermediate
   level of cooperation, with no differences in cooperation between the
   single-group and intergroup dilemmas. Taken together, the results
   suggest that the relationship between cultural values and cooperation,
   in particular with reference to vertical and horizontal components of
   individualism and collectivism, is more complex than has been suggested
   in past research. (C) 1999 Academic Press.},

   history, and attitudes toward political issues. A common collective
   basis of mutual value consensus was found in the two groups; however, as
   predicted, there were differences between secular and religious students
   on the three kinds of items, since the religious scored higher than the
   secular students on items emphasizing collectivist orientation. The
   differences, however, do not fit the common theoretical framework of

Abstract = {Institutions of higher learning in the United States have long played a
   disproportionate role in supplying leadership talent to the world's
   business and professional organizations. For 30 years, the most
   selective schools have been working to increase diversity in their
   student bodies. New research by the former presidents of Princeton and
   Harvard suggests that the experiences and initiatives of these academic
   institutions can provide business leaders with insight into how to
   create diverse organizations that succeed.
   The first insight has to do with clarity of mission. It is not enough to
   pursue diversity because it is ``the right thing to do.{''} In an
   insert, Raymond Gilmartin, the CEO of Merck, echoes that view,
   discussing the relationship between diversity and Merck's
   competitiveness.
   The second insight concerns recruiting. The authors challenge what they
   call ``the myth of pure merit,{''} the notion that recruiting is a
   precise science based only on grades and test scores. Instead, they
   argue, merit is about assembling a team by deciding which applicants,
   considered individually and collectively, will contribute most to
   achieving the company's goals.
   The third insight concerns how organizations help employees perform to
   their potential. Of the factors contributing to high graduation rates at
   the most selective schools, higher expectations and the efforts of
   mentors stand out as most important.
   Finally, the fourth insight is about how to achieve accountability in a
   corporate setting. Boards must ask: Are our recruiting policies working?
   and How are recruited employees doing? Reprint 99102.},

Volume = {20},

Abstract = {We present evidence that, across countries, similar jobs carry Very
   different levels of autonomy. Workers in Nordic countries have greater
   discretion than workers in the United States, Canada, and Australia, all
   else being equal. This suggests that Students of job autonomy, who
   emphasize task complexity and human capital, should heed the role of the
   wider institutional environment. We examine three explanations of the
   link between national location and autonomy. The Taylorism/de-skilling
   thesis suggests that work control is a zero-sum game between workers and
   managers, such that in countries where managers exercise great control,
   workers will exercise little. The collective bargaining thesis suggests
   that union bargaining strategy is the key: unionists will have high
   autonomy in `co-determination' countries and low autonomy in `job
   control' countries. We argue more broadly chat national management,
   training, bargaining, and unemployment systems operate according to
   different logics. Where they are oriented to rule-governed work,
   autonomy will be low. Where they are oriented to skill-governed work,
   autonomy will be high. Detailed data on job autonomy from over seven
   thousand jobs in seven countries support our contention that national
   employment systems shape job autonomy.},

Pages = {599-610},
Abstract = {In this study we directly measure culture along two of Hofstede's (1980)
   dimensions, individualism-collectivism and power distance, which we
   argue are potentially more malleable than stable, at least within the
   developing nation of interest, Indonesia. We compare these direct
   measures from Indonesia with those from a developed country, the United
   States, to gauge the degree to which the culture of this emerging
   economy remains stable despite strong foreign influences. Utilizing
   English and back-translated Indonesian language versions of the 1994
   Values Survey Module, we find statistically significant support for a
   narrowing of the differences in these two cultural dimensions between
   Indonesian and U.S. managers compared to earlier findings by Hofstede
   (1991).},

Abstract = {As more and more firms operate globally, an understanding of the effects
   of cultural differences on ethical decision making becomes increasingly
   important for avoiding potential business pitfalls and for designing
   effective international marketing management programs. Although several
   articles have addressed this area in general, differences along
   specific, cultural dimensions have not been directly examined. Hence,
   the purpose of this study was to examine differences in ethical decision
   making within Hofstede's cultural framework. The results confirm the
   utility of Hofstede's cultural dimensions and place ethical decision
   making within an overall theoretical framework. Sales agents from a high
   power distance, uncertainty avoidant, Confucian, collectivist culture
   (i.e., Taiwan) placed more Value on company and fellow employee
   interests (vis-a-vis self interests) than did managers from a masculine,
   individualistic culture (i.e., the United States). American and
   Taiwanese managers did not differ in their deontological norms or on the
   importance that they placed on customer interests. The theoretical and
   manage rial importance of these findings are also discussed.},

Abstract = {The paper examines the contribution to strategy by chairmen and
   non-executive directors in large UK companies. The collective label of
   `part-time board member' is used to refer to individuals performing
   these roles. The paper asks `how, if at all, do part-time board members
   influence strategy in UK plc's'?. Using data gathered from interviews
   with 108 company directors, the paper suggests that part-time board
   members do not simply ratify decisions made by all-powerful executives.
   A conceptual model is developed to show that part-time board members are
   able to influence processes of strategic choice, change and control by
   shaping both the ideas that form the content of company strategy and the
   methodologies and processes by which those ideas evolve. Their
   involvement in strategy is conditioned by factors such as: changing
   norms about corporate governance; the history and performance of the
   company; the process and conduct of board meetings and informal dialogue
   amongst company directors between board meetings.},

Abstract = {Although the resource allocation literature has frequently examined the
   decision rules used to distribute monetary resources, many other types
   of resources have not been systematically studied. In addition, very
   little is known about the allocation rules that might be used when
   resources are recovered (i.e., taken away) as opposed to distributed As
   managers frequently face decisions regarding the distribution or
   recovery of different resources, developing a greater understanding of
   the rules they might use to give or take away resources is important.
   This study examined the difficulty of resource allocation decisions and
   allocation rule choices. Our results suggest need rules are generally
   preferred by allocators, although rule preferences were affected by both
   the type of resource and whether the resource was being distributed
   rather than recovered. In particular the preference for equality rules
   was stronger when resources were recovered Our findings also suggest
   that managers may find recovery decisions more difficult than
   distribution decisions, and that monetary and affiliative resources are
   among the most difficult to allocate. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Inc. All

   in business in China. This profile is based on measures of individual
   values (Individualism, Collectivism and Confucianism) relevant to China

   more individualistic and more likely to act independently, while taking
   risks in the pursuit of profits. However, these New managers are,
   likewise, not forsaking their Confucian values. Thus, they may be viewed
   as crossverging their Eastern and Western influences, while on the road

Abstract = {This research examines the persuasive effect of emotional appeals on
   members of collectivist versus individualist cultures. The results of
   two experiments demonstrate that ego-focused (e.g., pride, happiness)
   Versus other-focused (e.g., empathy, peacefulness) emotional appeals
   lead to more favorable attitudes for members of a collectivist culture,
   while other-focused Versus ego-focused emotional appeals lead to more
   favorable attitudes for members of an individualist culture. Experiment
   2 was conducted to examine the psychological mechanism underlying these
   effects. The results indicated that the generation of and elaboration on
   a relatively novel type of thought (individual thoughts for members of a
   collectivist culture, collective thoughts for members of an
   individualist culture) account for the persuasive effects found in this
   research. These results are interpreted within an ability-motivation
   framework, and theoretical implications involving cross-cultural
   persuasion effects are discussed.},

Abstract = {We provide a comprehensive examination of shareholder resolutions to
   rescind poison pills. We find that pill rescission proposals are more
   frequent the more negative the market reaction to the initial pill
   adoption and the lower the insider and unaffiliated block ownership.
   Votes for such a proposal increase when performance is poor and for more
   onerous poison pills. While we document a stock price decline associated
   with the proposal announcements, we find poison pills are more likely to
   be restructured or rescinded when there is a shareholder resolution.
   Moreover, pill revisions are associated with stockholder wealth
   increases. Collectively, our results suggest that pill rescission
   proposals are more frequent when the pill is more likely to harm
   shareholders and that managers respond to shareholder proposals.},

   composition to influence social interaction, conflict, productivity, and
   perceptions of creativity among 258 MBA students. Our findings suggest
   that the purported benefits of demographic diversity are more likely to
   emerge in organizations that, through their culture, make organizational

Journal = {HUMAN RELATIONS},

Volume = {51},

Abstract = {This paper critically reviews the action research paradigm that has
   evolved over the last 50 years within and outside The Tavistock
   Insitute, with reference to radical shifts in the social construction of
   medicine and health that are occurring as a result of the transition
   toward the ``information society.{''} The medical domain has been chosen
   as an appropriate space within which to review the action research
   paradigm because it bridges both the past and future of the Institute.
   The paper firstly considers the original conception of action research
   and sociotechnical systems, and the role of consultants, in relation to
   Foucualt's analysis of power relations, social control, and ``dividing
   practices.{''} It then describes and analyzes recent developments in the
   field of medicine and healthcare service provision that, on the one
   hand, offer opportunities for increased self-management and control by
   consumers over physical, social, and emotional ``self-hood{''} and on
   the other could lead to further social surveillance and the domination
   and subjectification of the individual. Drawing on recent work using
   innovative models of action research in the field of HIV/AIDS, the paper
   concludes by discussing ways in which action research could harness
   developments in information and communication technologies to maximize
   individual and collective engagement in new forms of organizational and
   social relations.},

Abstract = {The neoclassical theory of demand applies to individuals, yet in
   empirical work it is usually taken as valid for households with many
   members. This paper explores what the theory of individuals implies for
   households that have more than one member. We make minimal assumptions
   about how the individual members of the household resolve conflicts. All
   we assume is that however decisions are made, outcomes are efficient. We
   refer to this as the collective setting. We show that in the collective
   setting household demands must satisfy a symmetry and rank condition on
   the Slutsky matrix. We also present some further results on the effects
   on demands of variables that do not modify preferences but that do
   affect how decisions are made.
   We apply our theory to a series of surveys of household expenditures
   from Canada. The tests of the usual symmetry conditions are rejected for
   two-person households but not for one-person households. We also show
   that income pooling is rejected for two-person households. We then test
   for out collective setting conditions on the couples data. None of the
   collective setting restrictions are rejected. We conclude that the
   collective setting is a plausible and tractable next step to take in the
   analysis of household behavior.},

   negotiations between either U.S. or Japanese negotiators, was confirmed
   with data from 30 intercultural, 47 U.S.-U.S. intracultural, and 18
   Japanese-Japanese intracultural simulated negotiations. Tests of
   secondary hypotheses indicated that there was less understanding of the
   priorities of the other party and the utility of a compatible issue in
   inter-than in intracultural negotiations. When information about
   priorities was available, intercultural negotiators were less able than
   intracultural negotiators to use it to generate joint gains.},

Abstract = {In a number of econometric models, rules of large-sample inference
   require a consistent estimate of f(0), where f(lambda) is the spectral
   density matrix of y(t) = u(t) x x(t), for covariance stationary vectors
   u(t), x(t). Typically y(t) is allowed to have nonparametric
   autocorrelation, and smoothing is used in the estimation of f(0). We
   give conditions under which f(0) can be consistently estimated without
   smoothing. The conditions are relevant to inference on slope parameters
   in models with an intercept and strictly exogenous regressors, and allow
   regressors and disturbances to collectively have considerable stationary
   long memory and to satisfy only mild, in some cases minimal, moment
   conditions. The estimate of f(0) dominates smoothed ones in the sense
   that it can have mean squared error of order n(-1), where n is sample
   size. Under standard additional regularity conditions, we extend the
   estimate of f(0) to studentize asymptotically normal estimates of
   structural parameters in linear simultaneous equations systems. A small

Abstract = {Strong majority influence can potentially harm organizational decisions
   by causing decision makers to engage in groupthink. This study examines
   whether and how computer-mediated communication (CMC) can reduce
   majority influence and thereby enhance the quality of decisions in some
   situations. To measure the impact of CMC on majority influence, three
   settings (unsupported, face-to-face CMC, and dispersed CMC) were
   compared. Matching laboratory experiments were carried out in an
   individualistic (the US) and a collectivistic culture (Singapore) to
   determine how the impact of CMC might be moderated by national culture.
   An intellective and a preference task were used to see whether the
   impact of CMC might be moderated by task type. The results showed that
   the impact of CMC on majority influence was contingent upon national
   culture. In the individualistic culture, majority influence was stronger
   in the unsupported setting than the face-to-face CMC and dispersed CMC
   settings. In the collectivistic culture, there were no corresponding
   differences. The results also revealed that the impact of CMC on
   majority influence was not moderated by task type. Instead, task type
   had a direct impact on majority influence. Regardless of the setting
   involved, majority influence was stronger with the preference than the
   intellective task. Besides demonstrating how cultural factors may
   moderate the impact of CMC, this study raises the broader issue of
   cultural relativism in current knowledge on CMC.},

Abstract = {This study was designed to examine both the pattern of team and player
   efficacy across a season of competition and the relationships among
   player efficacy, team efficacy, and team performance in collegiate ice
   hockey. The team and player efficacies of hockey players from 6 teams in
   a midwestern collegiate hockey league were assessed prior to 32 games.
   Official game statistics were factor analyzed to produce one useable
   performance measure, performance outcome. A consensus analysis
   demonstrated that players held homogeneous beliefs regarding their own
   and their teams' abilities to perform successfully. A meta-analysis of
   the regression equations for each team confirmed the homogeneity among
   teams and the predictive superiority of team efficacy in predicting team
   performance. Also, when team wins and losses were analyzed across the
   season, team efficacy significantly increased after a win and
   significantly decreased after a loss, but player efficacy was not
   affected.},

Abstract = {Two studies attempted to discriminate between a situational-economic and
   a cultural explanation for the recently reported finding that Chinese
   from the People's Republic of China (PRC) are more risk-seeking than
   Americans. Both studies compared American and Chinese proverbs related
   to risk and risk-taking. The first study added Germany as a control
   group for its socioeconomic similarity to the United States but its
   closer resemblance to the PRC in its social safety-net and cultural
   collectivism. Members of each culture rated American, Chinese, and
   German risk-related proverbs, respectively, on implied advice (to take
   or avoid risk) and applicability to financial or social risks. Results
   were consistent with the cultural explanation of national differences in
   risk taking: (a) Chinese and German proverbs were judged to provide more
   risk-seeking advice than American proverbs; (b) American proverbs were
   judged less applicable to risks in the social domain than Chinese and
   German proverbs; (c) regardless of national origin of proverbs, Chinese
   perceived proverbs to advocate greater risk-seeking than American
   raters, but only for financial and not for social risks. (C) 1998

   specificity},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT STUDIES},
Year = {1998},
Volume = {35},
Number = {4},
Pages = {457-479},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {The paper offers a synthesis of sociological and transactions cost
   economics perspectives on production networks. Sociological explanations
   of network effectiveness (competitiveness) stress the importance of
   trust, and transactions costs emphasizes asset specificity. The approach
   here is comparative, the capabilities of networks are assessed against
   those of the vertically integrated, managerially coordinated hierarchy.
   The argument is that the competitiveness of each form derives from
   different organizational capabilities. Neither is inherently superior by
   supporting different strategies, networks and hierarchies can co-exist.
   A distinction is drawn between those networks that rely on communal
   support and trust and those networks whose dynamism relies on
   individualistic and autonomous entrepreneurship. The absence of trust
   (or the surfeit of entrepreneurial zeal) leaves firms reliant on generic
   assets. Trust creates the conditions under which communities of firms
   can develop industry-specific assets capable of delivering real services
   to network firms that are unavailable through market channels. The
   competitiveness of a production network is a function of the value
   adding activities undertaken by agents and the collective responses made
   to external threats or disturbances. The argument is illustrated with
   reference to the organization of watch (timepieces) production in Hong
   Kong.},

Abstract = {Research on cross-cultural psychology, sociology, and anthropology
   suggests that the influence of face on social interactions is both
   pervasive and powerful in Asia. Face, however, has not gained general
   acceptance as an important theoretical concept in the literature on
   Asian organizational behavior and management. In this paper, we propose
   face as a key variable that can explain much of the complexity of social
   interactions in Asian organizations. We attempted to elaborate on the
   concept and dynamics of face in Asia in such a way as to capture its
   pervasive, significant but often subtle influences on organizational
   behavior. We also examined conditions, functions, and consequences of
   face dynamics to generate testable propositions for future research. We
   argue that scholars have to go beyond the individualistic assumptions
   about human behavior implicit in theories of organizational behavior in
   the West to better understand the richness of organizational behavior in
   Asia. In Asia, organizational behavior is better predicted by an
   individual's external attributes such as face than internal attributes
   such as desires, emotions, and cognition.},

Abstract = {Constellations-alliances among multiple firms-are used to perform
   complex, customized work in professional service. We examine two
   tensions inherent in multi-party collaborative work: managing hybrid
   systems, which are composed of individual and group tasks and outcomes,
   and aligning partners' logics of action. These two tensions provide
   firms the strategic choice with emphasizing individual or collective
   advantage. When constellation members pursue an individualist strategy,
   they employ an entrepreneurial logic. Constellations are a vehicle for
   honing their firm-distinctive expertise and enhancing their own
   opportunities. Given these firms' need for exposure to new learning and
   new markets from different partners and clients, the stability of the
   constellation is not of primary importance. This strategy promotes
   membership shifts in constellations and requires governance mechanisms
   for coordinating interactions among relative strangers. When
   constellation members pursue a collectivist strategy, they focus on
   their mutual benefits and employ a relational logic. Given these firms'
   need for intensifying relations with partners and clients, constellation
   members restrict interactions to certain select partners and clients and
   intensify their interactions. This strategy promotes stability in
   constellation membership and allows governance mechanisms specific to
   partners to develop. Due to positive feedback, these strategies develop
   certain capabilities and create specific relational patterns, which
   reinforce prior choices.},

Title = {The scope of alliances},
Journal = {ORGANIZATION SCIENCE},
Year = {1998},
Volume = {9},
Number = {3},
Pages = {340-355},
Month = {MAY-JUN},
Abstract = {We develop the notion that the choice of alliance scope materially
   affects the character of benefits that alliance participants receive,
   and thereby affects a range of issues having to do with the initiation,
   evolution, and termination of the alliance. Indeed, while
   under-emphasized by academics, determining alliance scope ranks among
   the most important tasks undertaken by practitioners of alliances.
   Restricting ourselves to alliances where mutual learning is the primary
   raison d'etre, we first define private benefits as those that accrue to
   subsets of participants in an alliance, and common benefits as those
   that accrue collectively to all participants. We demonstrate how the
   choice of alliance scope affects the mix of private and common benefits,
   and draw on earlier work to show how this, in turn, affects alliance
   partners' incentives to invest in learning.
   As illustrations of the utility of the framework of private and common
   benefits, we consider two applications. A simple model illustrates the
   relationship between the choice of alliance scope, the realization of
   private and common benefits, and the stability, or lack thereof, of the
   alliance. A second application sheds light on alliance evolution. It
   examines factors affecting both (a) how a particular alliance evolves,
   and (b) how firms manage sequences of alliances.
   Two broader theoretical points also emerge from this discussion of
   alliance scope. First, we argue that an analytical focus solely on the
   individual alliance may be inappropriate for studying a wide range of
   issues. Of the multiple sources of benefits that accrue to alliance
   participants, there are some whose realization depends on activities in
   which the firm is engaged, but that may have little to do with the
   alliance in question. Second, in contrast to much of the literature on
   alliances, our analysis is based upon the primitives of benefit streams,
   rather than on transaction cost reasoning. This complementary
   perspective is better suited to the task of highlighting how activities
   not governed by an alliance might nonetheless affect multiple aspects of
   the alliance.},

Abstract = {This paper proposes a co-evolutionary theory of strategic alliances. The
   paper proposes a framework which views strategic alliances in the

   this view, are embedded in a firm's strategic portfolio, and co-evolve
   with the firm's strategy, the institutional, organizational and
   competitive environment, and with management intent for the alliance.
   Specifically, we argue that alliance intent may be described, at any
   time, as having either exploitation or exploration objectives. We
   further discuss how the morphology of an alliance-absorptive capacity,
   control, and identification-may be isomorphic with its intent, and, in
   the aggregate, drive the evolution of the population of alliances.},

Title = {The interorganizational learning dilemma: Collective knowledge
   development in strategic alliances},
Journal = {ORGANIZATION SCIENCE},
Year = {1998},
Volume = {9},
Number = {3},
Pages = {285-305},
Month = {MAY-JUN},
Abstract = {Alliances are volatile key components of many corporations' competitive
   strategies. They offer fast and flexible means of achieving market
   access, scale economies, and competence development. However, strategic
   alliances can encounter difficulties that often lead to disappointing
   performance. The authors suggest that the way partners manage the
   collective learning process plays a central role in the success and
   failure of strategic alliances.
   Present understanding of interorganizational learning primarily focuses
   on how the individual organization can be a ``good partner{''} or try to
   win the internal ``race to learn{''} among the partners. The
   interorganizational learning dilemma is that (1) being a good partner
   invites exploitation by partners attempting to maximize their individual
   appropriation of the joint learning, and (2) such opportunistic learning
   strategies undercut the collective knowledge development in the
   strategic alliance.
   The authors develop a framework for understanding the dilemma through
   consideration of trade-offs between how collective learning is developed
   in alliances and how the joint learning outcomes are divided among the
   partners. They create a typology of five different learning strategies
   based on how receptive as well as how transparent an organization is in
   relation to its partners. The strategies are: collaboration (highly
   receptive and highly transparent); competition (highly receptive and
   nontransparent); compromise (moderately receptive and transparent);
   accommodation (nonreceptive and highly transparent); and avoidance
   (neither receptive nor transparent). Interorganizational learning
   outcomes are proposed to be the interactive results of the respective
   partners' type of adopted learning strategy.
   By synthesizing strategic alliance, organizational learning, collective
   action, and game theories, the framework contributes to understanding
   the variety in alliance development, performance, and longevity.
   Interorganizational learning is likely to be hindered by lack of either
   motivation or ability to absorb and communicate knowledge between the
   partner organizations. The dynamics of power, opportunism, suspicion,
   and asymmetric learning strategies can constitute processual barriers to
   collective knowledge development. In contrast, prior related interaction
   between the partners, high learning stakes, trust, and long-term
   orientation are likely to empower the collective learning process.
   Comparison of previous case studies and surveys of interorganizational
   learning provides partial empirical support for the proposed framework.
   The comparison also indicates several omissions in previous research,
   such as failure to consider either how receptive or how transparent the
   partners are, the interaction between their learning strategies, and
   their dynamic processes over time. Because these omissions are due
   partly to the methodological limitations of traditional case studies and
   cross-sectional surveys, the authors suggest a bridging case survey
   design for a more comprehensive test of their interactive, dynamic, and
   situational framework.},

Abstract = {This article presents a public goods-based theory that describes the
   process of producing multifirm, alliance-based, interorganizational
   communication and information public goods. These goods offer
   participants in alliances collective benefits that are (a)
   nonexcludable, in that they are available to all alliance partners
   whether or not they have contributed, and (b) jointly supplied, in that
   partners' uses of the good are noncompeting. Two generic types of goods
   produced are connectivity, the ability of partners to directly
   communicate with each other through the information and communication
   system, and communality, the availability of a commonly accessible pool
   of information to alliance partners. Four types of alliances that can
   produce these goods are identified: (a) precompetitive, (b) competitive,
   (c) joint value creation, and (d) value chain. The article examines a
   variety of factors that influence the production of alliance-based
   connective and communal goods. Twenty-three integrated propositions are
   presented. The article concludes with an example of the application of
   the theoretical model to research on connectivity and communality
   provided through an alliance-based interorganizational communication and
   information system linking more than 50 alliance partners.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ETHICS},
Year = {1998},
Volume = {17},
Number = {6},
Pages = {587-601},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {In Australia as is the case elsewhere, ethics is a developing aspect of
   business behaviour. Many educational institutions and business
   enterprises have a strong interest in the subject, particularly from the
   practical viewpoint of creating an ethical culture in business that has
   substantial practical effects. In this paper, the codes of ethics of
   five large enterprises are examined. They were selected as being typical
   of a collection of corporate codes used in Australia held by the Ethics
   Research Group at the University of Technology, Sydney. Two codes were
   from international companies: a chemical manufacturing company and a
   health, beauty and medical manufacturer. The other codes were from an
   Australian bank, an Australian federal government business agency, and
   an Australian mining company.
   Corporate codes of ethics rarely contain operational definitions to
   direct their addressees on situations of moral hazard and the required
   response, to achieve a particular desired ethical corporate culture.
   Consequently, addressees constitute the locus of ethical decision making
   in enterprises. By contrast, the language used in the corporate codes
   examined construct an authoritarian position in the writer/reader
   relationship from the overuse of grammatical structures such as
   relational clauses, the passive, nominalisation, grammatical metaphor
   and modality. Collectively, these structures communicate a strong sense
   of obligation and even powerlessness since a strong authoritarian tone
   is established which does not give the addressees the possibility of
   discretionary decision making.
   The authors acknowledge that these five grammatical structures have a
   place in corporate codes since they form part of the legitimate
   linguistic fabric of our language. Rather attention is drawn to this
   overuse to assist corporate code authors to avoid writing codes that
   have subtle unintended and contradictory messages.},

Abstract = {Collective knowledge building is a key strategic task for firms' success
   today. But creating and sharing knowledge are intangible activities that
   can neither be supervised nor forced out of people. They happen only
   when individuals cooperate voluntarily. A key challenge facing strategic
   management is obtaining the voluntary cooperation of individuals as
   firms formulate and implement their strategic decisions. This essay
   draws on the rich body of procedural justice research to address this
   critical issue. We argue that when people feel their strategic
   decision-making processes are fair, they display a high level of
   voluntary cooperation based on their attitudes of trust and commitment.
   Conversely, when people feel that the processes are unfair, they refuse
   to cooperate by hoarding ideas and dragging their feet in conceiving and
   executing strategic decisions. We further develop this argument into
   team performance wherein the attitudinal and behavioral effects of
   procedural justice are corroborated with theory and Initial evidence of
   their bottom-line performance consequences. We then build a theory,
   which we call intellectual and emotional recognition theory, that can
   explain why procedural justice invokes the side of human behavior that
   goes beyond outcome-driven self-interests and that is so critical in the
   knowledge economy. (C) 1998 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Most policy debates on regional policies implicitly assume that there is
   too much concentration. In our two-region model of migration, desirable
   concentration fails to occur under some conditions, and undesirable
   concentration occurs in others. In the latter case, even though the
   individuals collectively prefer to be distributed evenly across the two
   regions, they end up concentrating into one region in their pursuit of a
   better life. Hence, the freedom to move can be self-defeating. We
   characterize the conditions for such self-defeating concentration to
   occur. The coordination failures between the entry decision of service
   firms and the migration decision of individuals are caused by the
   incompleteness of markets due to the endogeneity of the range of
   services available, which deprive the agents of the opportunity to
   signal demand and supply for potential services. The argument does not
   rely on price distortions, the nonconvexities implied by increasing
   returns and nontradedness, congestion externalities, nor myopia in
   migration decisions.},

Abstract = {This paper presents two studies investigating the influence of social
   perceptions (perceived leafing, collective efficacy, and cohesion) on
   group goal processes (difficulty and commitment) and group performance.
   The role of group goal processes as mediators of the relationships
   between social perception variables and group performance was also
   tested. The first study involved a sample of 247 college students in 59
   groups working on a team interdependent, divisible academic task.
   Results supported all but one hypothesis. The mediation hypothesis was
   not supported as both group goal and social perception variables related
   similarly to group performance. The second study employed a different
   design to address some limitations of the first study and to extend
   those findings. Results from the second study, using 383 college
   students in 101 groups, were consistent with Study 1 with two
   exceptions. First, the mediation hypothesis was supported in Study a,
   replicating the findings of Klein and Mulvey (1995). Second, anticipated
   lower effort and the sucker effect, additional intervening variables
   examined in Study 2, partially mediated the relationship between
   perceived leafing and collective goal difficulty as hypothesized. (C)

   and guides members toward a particular model. The normative conflict
   models of Japanese, German, and American business managers are predicted

   hierarchical differentiation, (b) explicit contracting, and (c)
   polychronicity. The majority of specific hypotheses about cultural

   these findings for international business managers as well as

Abstract = {Irving Janis's concept of groupthink can be seen in the context of our
   on-again-off-again love affair with groups. Group decisions have often
   been seen as offering the benefits of collective wisdom, but may also
   lead to disastrous consequences. Groupthink then focuses on the negative
   effects of erroneous group decisions. Two major examples of groupthink
   are reexamined and compared: the disastrous Bay of Pigs decision by the
   elite advisory group of President Kennedy, and the advisory groups of
   President Nixon, which led to the Watergate disaster and at unsuccessful
   attempts to cover up. In both, it is suggested there was a ``runaway
   norm,{''} escalation and polarization with the norm being to exceed
   other members of the group in taking more extreme and unrestrained
   actions against an ``enemy.{''} While Janis seems to suggest that
   groupthink will ultimately lead the group to fail in its ultimate
   endeavors, we need to consider the frightening possibility that in the
   case of the Nixon group, the group actions came close to being
   successful. (C) 1998 Academic Press.},

Abstract = {This paper advances an explanation for decision fiascoes that reflects
   recent theoretical trends and was developed in response to a growing
   body of research that has failed to substantiate the groupthink model
   (Janis, 1982), In this new framework, the lack of vigilance and
   preference for risk that characterizes groups contaminated by groupthink
   are attributed in large part to perceptions of collective efficacy that
   unduly exceed capability. High collective efficacy may also contribute
   to the negative framing of decisions and to certain administrative and
   structural organizational faults, In the making of critical decisions,
   these factors induce a preference for risk and a powerful concurrence
   seeking tendency that, facilitated by group polarization, crystallize
   around a decision option that is likely to fail. Implications for
   research and some evidence in support of this approach to the groupthink
   phenomenon are also discussed. (C) 1998 Academic Press.},

Title = {Shopping behavior and consumer preference for store price format: Why
   ``large basket{''} shoppers prefer EDLP},
Journal = {MARKETING SCIENCE},
Year = {1998},
Volume = {17},
Number = {1},
Pages = {66-88},
Abstract = {In recent years, the supermarket industry has become increasingly
   competitive. One outcome has been the proliferation of a variety of
   pricing formats, and considerable debate among academics and
   practitioners about how these formats affect consumers' store choice
   behavior. This paper advances the idea that consumer shopping behavior
   (as defined by average size of the shopping basket and the frequency of
   store visits) is an important determinant of the store choice decision
   when stores offer different price formats. A recent Wall Street Journal
   article that summarized the result of Bruno's management switching the
   chain from EDLP to HILO illustrates the importance of this issue: ``The
   company's price-conscious customers, used to shopping for a fixed basket
   of goods, stayed away in droves.{''} Thus, the audience for this paper
   includes practitioners and academics who wish to understand store
   choices or predict how a change in price format might affect store
   profitability and the mix of clientele that shop there.
   This paper attempts to understand the relationship between grocery
   shopping behavior, retail price format, and store choice by posing and
   answering the following questions. First, after controlling for other
   factors (e.g., distance to the store, prior experience in the store,
   advertised specials), do consumer expectations about prices for a basket
   of grocery products ({''}expected basket attractiveness{''}) influence
   the store choice decision? This is a fairly straightforward test of the
   effect of price expectations on store choice. Second, are different
   pricing formats (EDLP or HILO) more or less attractive to different
   types of shoppers? To adequately answer the second question, we must
   link consumers' category purchase decisions, which collectively define
   the market basket, and the store choice decision.
   We study the research questions using two complementary approaches.
   First, we develop a stylized theory of consumer shopping behavior under
   price uncertainty. The principal features and results from the stylized
   model can be summarized as follows. Shoppers are defined (in a relative
   sense) as either large or small basket shoppers. Thus, we abstract from
   the vicissitudes of individual shopping trips and focus on meaningful
   differences across shoppers in terms of the expected basket size per
   trip. The shoppers make category purchase incidence decisions and can
   choose to shop in either an EDLP or a HILO store. Large basket shoppers
   are shoppers who have a relatively high probability of purchase for any
   given category, and as such they are more captive to prices across many
   different categories. The first two propositions summarize the price
   responsiveness of shoppers. In particular, the large basket shoppers are
   less responsive to price in their individual category purchase incidence
   decisions; this makes them ware responsive to the expected basket price
   in their store choice decisions. This key structural implication of the
   model highlights an asymmetry between response at the category level and
   response at the store level. The result is quite intuitive; a (large
   basket) shopper with less ability to respond to prices in individual
   product categories will be more sensitive to the expected cost of the
   overall portfolio (the market basket) when choosing a store. The final
   proposition derives the price at which a given shopper will be
   indifferent between an EDLP and a HILO store. The key insight is that as
   a shopper increases his or her tendency to become a large basket
   shopper, the EDLP stare can increase its (constant) price closer and
   closer to the average price in the HILO store. Conversely, as the
   shopper becomes more of small basket shopper, the EDLP store must lower
   its price closer to the deal price in the HILO store. Thus, we have the
   interesting result that small basket shoppers prefer HILO stores, even
   at higher average prices.
   The empirical testing mirrors the development of the consumer theory. We
   test the implications of the propositions using a market basket scanner
   panel database. The database includes two years of shopping data for
   1,042 households in two separate market areas. We first use
   household-level grocery expenditures to model the probability that a
   household is a large or small basket shopper. Subsequently, we estimate
   purchase incidence and store choice models. We find that after
   controlling for important factors such as household distance to the
   store, previous experience in the store, and advertised specials, price
   expectations for the basket influence store choice. Furthermore, EDLP
   stores get a greater than expected share of business from large basket
   shoppers; HILO stores get a greater than expected share from small
   basket shoppers. Consistent with the implications of the propositions,
   large basket shoppers are relatively price inelastic in their category
   purchase incidence decisions and price elastic in their store choice
   decisions.},

Abstract = {This essai develops a philosophical perspective on managerial cognition.
   More precisely, it offers an epistemological critique of orthodox models
   of strategic management. The critique is based on the confrontation of
   these models with a diverse set of philosophical texts on knowledge and
   action. The orthodoxy is composed of the three prescriptive schools
   identified by Mintzberg (1990) and considered as explicit collective
   knowledge. To say nothing of the omission of socio-political forces at
   work in strategy formation, three main biases are elicited and
   discussed: a bias towards thinking to the detriment of other forms of
   reasoning, a bias towards binary logic, and the failure to recognize
   feeling as a source of reason. We suggest that philosophical questioning
   - epistemological and ethical - can help practitioners and scholars
   renew their management models, recipes and theories.},

Year = {1998},
Volume = {76},
Number = {1},
Pages = {136+},
Month = {JAN-FEB},
Abstract = {Rare is the company that does not periodically review the performance of
   its staff, business units, and suppliers. But rare, as well, is the
   company that does such a review of one of its most important
   contributors - its board of directors. Reviewing a board's performance
   is not an easy proposition: it has to be done by the members themselves,
   people who generally have many other responsibilities and whose time is
   always at a premium.
   But done properly, appraisals can help boards become more effective by
   clarifying individual and collective responsibilities. They can help
   improve the working relationship between a company's board and its
   senior management. They can help ensure a healthy balance of power
   between the board and the CEO. And, once in place, an appraisal process
   is difficult to dismantle, making it harder for a new CEO to dominate a
   board or avoid being held accountable for poor performance.
   Done properly is the key here, though. Done incorrectly, board
   appraisals can degenerate into self-serving evaluations or unpleasant,
   time-wasting exercises. Worse, they can evolve into rigid mechanical
   processes that discourage innovation. In fact, all of the approaches the
   authors observed in two years of research were incomplete. The authors
   have therefore drawn on the strengths of several different approaches to
   synthesize a best-practice process that is both rigorous and
   comprehensive.},

   We extend previous analyses of the effectiveness of positive and
   negative tests for ambiguous verification or conclusive falsification of
   hypotheses by emphasizing the importance of examples following positive
   or negative tests. Cooperative four-person groups solved rule induction
   problems from a single known example of the correct rule by proposing
   hypotheses and selecting evidence on each of four arrays on a series of
   trials. There were more examples following positive tests than negative

   t to the correct hypothesis on trial t + 1 was higher for positive tests

Abstract = {Despite its increasing importance to the research and practice of
   organizational management, there is no consensus on how to describe,
   explain and prescribe network as an organizational form. Based upon the
   evidence of the Chinese network form within its institutional and
   cultural contexts, this paper seeks to make three contributions. First,
   it describes network as a unique form, different from other organi
   zational forms and thus needing a new perspective. Second, it explains
   network form from a holistic, dynamic and paradoxical perspective by
   synthesizing economic, social and psychological rationalities. Third, it
   prescribes the ideal-typical network form by offering a geocentric
   framework of organizational form which is neither culture-blind
   (under-embedded) nor culture-bounded lover-embedded).},

Abstract = {In recent years, considerable pressure has grown within the British
   auditing industry for limitation of liability arising from negligent
   mis-statements in audit reports. Under British company law, auditors are
   forbidden from contracting with companies for their liability to be
   restricted. This legal provision was introduced in the Companies Act
   1929 as a byproduct of legislation relating to directors' liability. The
   paper explores the background to this legal provision, observing that
   auditor liability cannot be viewed as a self-contained matter of
   interest only to a limited community. Attitudes to auditor liability
   have been shaped against a background of changes in the law of
   negligence, some, but by no means all, arising from cases involving
   auditors. Moreover, changing concepts of the position of the auditor
   within corporate governance structures have at different times
   encouraged and discouraged the assimilation of the legal treatments of
   auditors and directors. These concepts themselves reflect differing
   notions of what actually constitutes the ``company{''}: a collectivity
   of shareholders or a separate entity controlled by directors. These
   notions emerged against a background of corporate failure and the need
   to allocate losses among various parties with different degrees of
   culpability for failure. However, legal developments do not account by
   themselves for changing attitudes within the auditing industry towards
   unlimited liability; acceptance of full responsibility for one's
   statements, adopted as a badge of professional status, has more recently
   been seen as inhibiting the commercial development of British auditing.

   studies?},
Journal = {ORGANIZATION STUDIES},
Year = {1998},
Volume = {19},
Number = {3},
Pages = {415-447},
Abstract = {This paper examines the promise of Foucault as a vehicle for addressing
   subjectivity and organizations. It questions the supposed
   non-essentialism and nondualism of Foucauldian work, and argues that
   such work has difficulties in theorizing agency, and the relation
   between self and discourse. Though the paper is critical of previous
   attacks on the anti-materialistic stance of Foucauldian work, it
   nevertheless suggests that Foucauldian studies have been unable to
   adequately theorize `material' relations, and that they have so far
   provided an inadequate basis by which to develop an ethics of either
   individual or collective change. In developing this critique, the paper
   largely focuses on Foucauldian work rather than the text of Foucault
   himself, though some attention is paid to Volumes 1 to 3 of The History
   of Sexuality. Feminist work is also employed in order to illustrate the
   limitations of Foucault in theorizing the self and subjectivity.},

Volume = {24},

Abstract = {This research presents a ``meso{''} level approach that models
   charismatic leadership in organizations as a function of contextual
   factors (such as work unit structure, work group collectivism, and
   crisis), an issue that has rarely been explored in charismatic
   leadership research. Data were collected from 596 managers and
   subordinates embedded in 101 work units in a large, complex organization
   and were analyzed at the individual, group, and cross-levels of
   analysis. Results indicate that organic structure and collectivistic
   cultural orientation were positively associated with the emergence of
   charismatic leadership, whereas perceptions of crisis were negatively
   related to charismatic leadership. Further, subordinates' ratings of
   leader charisma were related to leader ratings of work unit performance.
   The implications of these results for research and practice are

Journal = {ORGANIZATION STUDIES},
Year = {1998},
Volume = {19},
Number = {6},
Pages = {1005-1027},
Abstract = {In Southeast Asia, people of Chinese origin have a remarkably strong
   presence in trade and industry. The main question addressed in this
   paper is whether the organization of inter-firm linkages in the
   Indonesian herbal medicine (jamu) industry resemble characteristics of
   the Chinese family business or whether, in this indus try, a distinct
   mode of market organization has developed. The business systems approach
   forms the basis of the analytical framework which is comprised of four
   market organization characteristics and five key social institutions. In
   the Indonesian national context, a number of mutually connected social
   institutions constitute a favourable environment for the development of
   the Chinese family business system. Results from case studies of eight
   large and medium-sized jamu firms owned by either Indonesian Chinese or
   indigenous business people show that, in many respects, the market
   organization in the Indonesian jamu industry reflects Chinese family
   business characteristics. However, a distinct Javanese characteristic
   was also found. The jamu firms display strong paternalistic behaviour
   towards their suppliers and customers, which can be linked to Javanese
   authority relations known as bapakism and the high level of collectivism
   within micro-societies in Indonesia.},

   Third Italian districts which change mainly through collective learning
   in a relatively stable population of firms and Marshallian districts
   which change mainly through the competitive replacement of relatively
   inert firms. I explore this distinction empirically with data on the
   relationship between district size and firm mortality rates in a textile

   U.S. negotiators are more likely to subscribe to self-interest and joint
   problem solving norms, and Hong Kong Chinese negotiators are more likely
   to subscribe to an equality norm. Further, U.S. negotiators report more
   satisfaction when they maximize joint gain and Hong Kong Chinese
   negotiators are happier when they achieve outcome parity. The reported
   norms and outcome evaluations are consistent with the value profiles of
   the two cultures. The implications of these cultural differences are
   discussed in terms of expanding U.S, based negotiation theory.},

   in two experiments, the impact of motivation, congruity of persuasive

   strategies and product evaluations of members of a collectivist culture
   were compared with findings documented in past research in individualist
   cultures. This research supports the view that perceptual differences in
   cue diagnosticity account for systematic differences in persuasive
   effects across cultures. It is also suggested that existing theoretical
   frameworks, specifically the dual process models of persuasion, are
   robust across cultures and can help predict and explain cultural

Abstract = {Individuals do not seek help, even when help is needed and available,
   because help seeking implies incompetence and dependence, and therefore
   is related to powerlessness, It was hypothesized that gender, status,
   and organizational norms affect the importance of maintaining and
   accruing power, which in turn affect help seeking behaviors. A
   laboratory and a field study showed that there was more help seeking
   between equal-status than unequal-status individuals, Further, both
   studies revealed that males sought more help in collective than
   individualistic organizational norms, though the trend was not apparent
   for females, These results shed light on the psychological mechanisms
   underlying help seeking behaviors and have practical implications for
   developing steps to foster help seeking in organizations. (C) 1997

Abstract = {Recently, a number of researchers seeking to develop cognitive
   approaches for understanding processes associated with the development
   and implementation of competitive positioning strategies have drawn
   attention to the notion of `cognitive inertia'. Once established, there
   is a danger that actors may become overly dependent on their mental
   models of competitive space, to the extent that they fail to notice
   changes in the material conditions of their business environment, until
   these changes have become so widespread, or significant in other ways,
   that their organization's capacity for successful adaptation has been
   seriously undermined. While there have been several anecdotal accounts
   of cognitive inertia reported in the literature, and a number of
   researchers have explored processes of cognitive change in organizations
   more generally, to date there have been virtually no studies published
   which have investigated this phenomenon specifically within the domain
   of competitor assessment. This paper reports one such investigation, a
   longitudinal field study which explored the extent to which actors'
   mental models of competitive space in the UK residential estate agency
   (real estate) industry, an industry characterized by high volatility in
   recent years, remained stable or changed over time. An initial sample of
   208 respondents from 58 firms completed detailed questionnaires at the
   onset of the recent recession in the UK property market. The
   questionnaires were designed to elicit the respondents' perceptions of
   their own organization and various competitors on a number of key
   dimensions. A sub-sample of 114 respondents from 41 firms returned a
   further set of completed questionnaires, 12 to 18 months later, when the
   recession had become deeply established. The findings are entirely
   consistent with the cognitive inertia hypothesis. The results indicate
   that the respondents' individual and collective cognitions remained
   highly stable, despite a significant down-turn in the property market
   from T1 to T2.},

Title = {A comparative study of values among Chinese and US entrepreneurs:
   Pragmatic convergence between contrasting cultures},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BUSINESS VENTURING},
Year = {1997},
Volume = {12},
Number = {6},
Pages = {483-505},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The People's Republic of China is the world's leading Communist power,
   ver it also represents the largest potential market for international
   investment and development. In recent years, China has actively pursued
   private enterprise development, passing its first Private Company Act in
   1988, and subsequently encouraging entrepreneurial activities. More than
   a half-million new ventures in high-growth manufacturing, engineering,
   and infrastructural development have been independently established in
   China in little more than six years, and although it would be
   presumptuous to assume that China is racing toward a free enterprise
   economy there are major changes taking place. From an entrepreneurial
   perspective, these changes are in sharp contrast to the nation's
   political ideology, and those who are pursuing new ventures constitute a
   vanguard of individuals at adds with a majority of society.
   A critical concern is whether China's entrepreneurs pose a threat to
   those who are entrenched in a political ideology that, by definition is
   opposed to flee market economics and private enterprise. As Hofstede
   (1980) has pointed out, characteristics of a people are defined by their
   prevailing value systems, and research by Bond (1991), Hofstede (1983a,
   1983b), Schwartz (1992), and Triandis et al. (1986) has shown that by
   systematically studying human values we can gain valuable insights about
   patterns of behavior, motivation, and expectations of cross-cultural
   boundaries. Consequently, this study was developed to replicate previous
   value-related studies among Chinese entrepreneurs and nonentrepreneurial
   managers. A sample of more than 200 executives of state-owned and
   privately founded industrial companies provided comparable groups for
   comprehensive interviews. An analogous sample of U.S. entrepreneurs was
   selected to represent Western values. This extends several previous
   studies on private enterprise development in China, but, clearly, the
   convenient and limited sample cannot be construed as representative of a
   geographically and ethnically diversified country of more than 1.1
   billion people. However, it does provide useful insights to differences
   and similarities in work-related values between Chinese entrepreneurs,
   managers, and U.S. entrepreneurs as exploratory research.
   A primary consideration of this study was to enrich the existing
   research concerning entrepreneurial values, and in the process, question
   whether Chinese entrepreneurial values are similar to those held by U.S.
   entrepreneurs. If so, there would be a stronger case for convergence of
   value systems and commensurate behavior. Similarities would also support
   arguments by many that entrepreneurial characteristics, such as
   individualism, achievement motives, and self-deterministic behavior, are
   universal. This is complicated, however, by a Confucian social
   philosophy that places little value on these attributes while
   underscoring the importance of collective behavior, conformist behavior,
   and referent group loyalty. It is further complicated by two generations
   of Communist doctrine that has suppressed individual initiative,
   commercial achievement, and social mobility. Can entrepreneurial values
   prevail under such adverse conditions? More specifically, can values
   associated with individualism and self-determination exist in a society
   that is collectivist and conformist? Several recent studies on
   entrepreneurial values suggest that apparent contradictory value sets
   might co-exist (Baum et al. 1993; Chow and Tsang 1994; Erez and Earley
   1993; Hofstede and Bond 1988; Holt Ralston, and Terpstra 1994).
   Entrepreneurial research has also questioned the concept of universal
   values and found that, in many instances, cultural-based values are not
   necessarily malleable (McGrath et al. 1992), values are often contingent
   on prevailing cultural antecedents (Shenkar and Von Glinow 1994), and
   discordant or paradoxical values exist within so-called collectivist
   societies, among presumed cohesive groups, and within well-defined
   ethnic clusters (McGrath, MacMillan, and Scheinberg 1992; Ohe, Honjo,
   and MacMillan 1990; Ralston et al. 1993; Triandis et al. 1988).
   The current study revealed patterns of value orientations among Chinese
   entrepreneurs, Chinese executives of state-owned or joint venture firms,
   and U.S. entrepreneurs that in some instances were substantially
   different, and in other instances quite similar. Contrasts in these
   patterns suggest an apparent paradox of entrepreneurship in a
   collectivist society like China, and in particular, a potential
   confrontation between Chinese entrepreneurs and nonentrepreneurial
   managers. The results showed that, indeed the respondent Chinese
   managers and entrepreneurs differed sharply on many crucial value
   dimensions, and although the survey was limited to a southern industrial
   province, there is the possibility that China may be facing an extremely
   difficult transition period toward a constrained market economy with
   overtones of a possible ideological backlash. The results revealed many
   similarities between the respondent Chinese and U.S. entrepreneurs, but
   also several important differences steeped in Confucian social
   philosophy. Although there may be some convergence in values, it is more
   likely that Chinese entrepreneurs are simply pragmatic, and therefore
   selective in developing behavior that reflects values associated with
   achievement, independence, freedom of choice, and self-determination. If
   these results could be interpreted as prevalent beyond our exploratory
   sample, then pragmatic expectations may be driving private enterprise
   development in China more than cultural values, but this is difficult to
   verify. Whatever implications are drawn from this study must also be
   taken cautiously because there are indications that definitions of
   certain values, such as achievement or independence, may have
   substantially different meanings to American and Chinese entrepreneurs.
   Care was taken to make translations comparable during the field
   interviews, but Western concepts inherent in the instruments used for
   value research may have elicited responses or associated meanings among
   the Chinese that cannot be accurately interpreted. (C) 1997 Elsevier

Volume = {75},
Number = {6},
Pages = {82+},
Month = {NOV-DEC},
Abstract = {Companies all across the economic spectrum are making use of teams. They
   go by a variety of names and can be found at all levels. In fact, you
   are likely to find the group at the very top of an organization
   professing to be a team. But even in the best of companies, a so-called
   top team seldom functions as a real team.
   Real teams must follow a well-defined discipline to achieve their
   performance potential. And performance is the key issue - not the
   fostering of ``team values{''} such as empowerment, sensitivity, or
   involvement. In recent years, the focus on performance was lost in many
   companies. Even today, CEOs and senior executives often see few gains in
   performance from their attempts to become more teamlike.
   Nevertheless, a team effort at the top can be essential to capturing the
   highest performance results possible - when the conditions are right.
   Good leadership requires differentiating between team and nonteam
   opportunities, and then acting accordingly.
   Three litmus tests must be passed for a team at the top to be effective.
   First, the team must shape collective work-products - these are tangible
   performance results that the group can achieve working together that
   surpass what the team members could have achieved working on their own.
   Second, the leadership role must shift, depending on the task at hand.
   And third, the team's members must be mutually accountable for the
   group's results. When these criteria can be met, senior executives
   should come together to achieve real team performance. When the criteria
   cannot be met, they should rely on the individual leadership skills that
   they have honed over the years.},

Title = {A model of work-based learning},
Journal = {ORGANIZATION SCIENCE},
Year = {1997},
Volume = {8},
Number = {6},
Pages = {563-578},
Month = {NOV-DEC},
Abstract = {A comprehensive model of work-based learning is illustrated combining
   explicit and tacit forms of knowing and theory and practice modes of
   learning at both individual and collective levels. The model is designed
   to bring together epistemic contributions which are typically studied in
   isolation. The learning types produced from the model represent
   processes the intersection of which can contribute to the development of
   a comprehensive theory for integrating learning and work.
   At the individual level, work-based learning might start with
   conceptualization which provides practitioners with a means to challenge
   the assumptions underlying their practice. In experimentation, they
   engage their conceptual knowledge in such a way that it becomes
   contextualized or grounded. However, within the world of practice, in
   applying theoretical criteria or advanced analytical techniques, one
   confronts technical, cultural, moral, and personal idiosyncrasies which
   defy categorization. Hence, experience is required to reinforce the
   tacit knowledge acquired in experimentation. In fact, learning acquired
   through experience, often referred to as implicit learning, is the
   foundation for tacit knowledge and can be used to solve problems as well
   as make reasonable decisions about novel situations. Nevertheless,
   reflection is required to bring the inherent tacit knowledge of
   experience to the surface. It thus contributes to the reconstruction of
   meaning.
   At the collective level, conceptualization again makes a contribution in
   informing spontaneous inquiry but is now embedded within the more formal
   methods of applied science. Scientists seek to describe and explain
   social reality through the manipulation of theoretical propositions
   using the rules of hypothetico-deductive logic. The theories of applied
   science are often not helpful to practitioners, however, unless they are
   incorporated into practice. This is the purview of action learning
   wherein real-time experience, especially problems occurring within one's
   own work setting, constitutes the primary subject matter. As
   practitioners come together by being involved with one another in
   action, they may become a community of practice wherein they learn to
   construct shared understanding amidst confusing and conflicting data.
   Hence, community of practice returns knowledge back into its context
   such that groups learn to observe and experiment with their own
   collective tacit processes in action. Action science is called upon to
   bring the individuals' and group's mental models, often untested and
   unexamined, into consciousness. It is a form of
   ``reflection-in-action{''} which attempts to discover how what one did
   contributed to an unexpected or expected outcome, taking into account
   the interplay between theory and practice.
   Applications of the model can spur conceptual and practical developments
   that might lead to a comprehensive theory of work-based learning. The
   discussion takes up such issues as transition links between learning
   types, their segmentation by function or process, and implications for
   epistemology. A sample program, incorporating many of the learning types
   in the model, is demonstrated. The paper argues that all eight types of
   learning need to be brought into consideration if learners are to
   achieve proficiency and become critical while learning at work.},

Abstract = {Goals of group harmony and interpersonal fairness in reward allocation
   are believed to invoke use of the equality and equity rules,

   allocation rule is subtraction, and that the moderation effect of the
   goal of group harmony arises from response distortions on the reward
   scale, cognitive distortions of the inputs given, or both, Participants
   from India divided monetary reward between two persons ``fairly{''} and
   in a way that can ``minimize group conflict.{''} There were two inputs
   about each person-effort and performance (Experiment I) or performance
   over 2 years (Experiments II-TV), Data of majority of the participants
   conformed to the requirements of the subtractive model, Patterns in the
   moderation effect across the raw and monotonically rescaled data of
   individual participants further indicated that the response distortions,
   input distortions, and response-input distortions are the most,
   moderate, and least frequent responses to the goal of group harmony,

Abstract = {To understand variations in citizenship behavior within a culture, we
   examine the relationship between citizenship behaviors and
   organizational justice in two studies in a Chinese context, using two
   cultural characteristics (traditionality and modernity) and one
   individual (gender) characteristic. In Study 1, we develop an indigenous
   measure of organizational citizenship behavior and explore the
   similarities and differences of this measure with its Western
   counterpart. In Study 2, we use this citizenship behavior measure to
   test its relationship to justice. Results demonstrate that
   organizational justice (distributive and procedural) is most strongly
   related to citizenship behavior for individuals who endorse less
   traditional, or high modernity, values. In addition, we found the
   relationship between justice and citizenship behavior to be stronger for
   men than for women. The studies are discussed in terms of the generality
   of citizenship behavior and its relation to organizational justice and
   cultural characteristics.},

Journal = {MIS QUARTERLY},

Pages = {321-353},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The Bank of America literally changed the banking industry during the
   1950s by means of its ERMA and IBM 702 computer systems. These
   innovations in information technology resulted in a dominate design that
   helped keep the Bank of America in the lead for over a decade and a
   half. They were the collective work of a leader, Clark Beise, a maestro,
   Al Zipf, and a group of supertechs, ail of whom became the prototypes
   for these crucial roles. Bank of America was the first organization,
   among a selected few, to successfully negotiate the innovation cascade
   leading from crisis to a dominant IT design. Due in large part to IBM's
   failure to deliver a fully operational operating system for its 360/65,
   however, coinciding with the leadership's attention toward international
   markets, in the late 1960s the Bank of America lost its lead. After
   several decades `'in the trough,'' as a result of aggressive investment
   and leadership, the bank re-emerged as a strong competitor. This story
   of achieving alignment in strategy and structure by means of
   technological innovation, of the almost tragic breaking of that
   alignment, and of fervent efforts made to gain realignment illuminates
   some of the most important lessons of IT management that can be learned
   from the field's relatively recent, but dramatic, history.},

Title = {Individualism, collectivism and entrepreneurship: A framework for
   international comparative research},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BUSINESS VENTURING},
Year = {1997},
Volume = {12},
Number = {5},
Pages = {367-384},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {This article presents a theoretical framework and seven related
   propositions linking national culture-specifically individualist and
   collectivist orientations-to entrepreneurship. The framework identifies
   how both orientations affect the functions of entrepreneurship. This
   perspective casts new light on cross-cultural research that, while
   generally confirming individualism-entrepreneurship ties, has had less
   success accounting for the entrepreneurial vitality of largely
   `'collectivist'' nations-especially Japan.
   There are two main streams of research on the effects of individualism
   and collectivism on entrepreneurship. The micro-level stream finds that
   those who generate variety-founders and corporate entrepreneurs-tend to
   be individualistic. This work does not identify proclivities for the
   other entrepreneurial function, leveraging resources. The macro-stream
   associates both individualism and collectivism with national levels of
   economic growth and innovation.
   The framework comprises tow dimensions depicting (1) levels of
   individualism nad collectivism, and (2) the entrepreneurial functions. I
   conceive of individualism and collectivism as two characteristic
   orientations distributed in varying proportions within and between
   cultures and individuals. These characteristics are not polar ends of a
   continuum, as commonly described. The second dimension recognizes that
   entrepreneurship requires two activities: generating variety through
   innovation or new ventures, and leveraging resources internally or by
   establishing external ties. This paper's main contribution comes from
   the recognition that two entrepreneurial functions are very different
   processes. Variety generation requires mostly individual creativity and
   initiative; resource leverage depends on efficient relationships that
   thrive under collectivism, but can be induced contractually between
   individualists. These differences reveal that individualism and
   collectivism neither categorically encourage nor discourage
   entrepreneurship; rather they influence how its functions are
   accomplished.
   The propositions outlined in this paper can sharpen future research on
   individualism, collectivism, and entrepreneurship. In short, the paper
   claims individualists produce breakthroughs that collectivists implement
   and improve. Individualists show proclivities for new venture formation
   and making major innovations. They tend to leverage their resources
   through contract-based relations. For example, resources are stretched
   internally using contingent, performance-based incentives, and outside
   funds can be acquired through venture-capital agreements. In contrast,
   collectivists generate variety through group-based, incremental
   improvements and changes. Collectivists leverage their own resources by
   harnessing `'clanlike'' affiliations, and securing the use of the
   resources of other firms by building close relational ties, like
   keiretsu. Theory acknowledging that individualism and collectivism are
   not negatively related allows us to recognize that both orientations can
   contribute to entrepreneurship.
   The framework has key implications for entrepreneur/managers and
   policymakers. Recognizing that individualism and collectivism both
   contribute to entrepreneurship can guide decision-makers to examine the
   inventory of these orientations in their firms or regions, and implement
   policies to address shortfalls. For example, Americans can concentrate
   more on building close network ties while Japanese can focus on
   encouraging individual innovations. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Inc.},

Abstract = {This paper develops the construct of organizational hope as a

   It calls on organizational scholars and practitioners to move beyond the
   critical impulse by advancing ``textured vocabularies of hope{''} that
   affirm the best and most promising dimensions of social and
   organizational life and provide a moral image of the future to guide
   collective action. This can be accomplished by defining hopeful research
   agendas and choosing methods of inquiry that explore and illuminate the
   hopes and aspirations of a broad range of organizational members. After
   clarifying the concept of textured vocabularies of hope, this paper
   undertakes a thorough analysis of hope by tracing the construct
   throughout the Western intellectual tradition, highlighting four of
   hope's enduring qualities, and offering a set of propositions that
   extends the implications of organizational hope to our task as scholars

Abstract = {The present article focuses on two decision problems that can be

   maintenance of scarce resources, It is argued that the presentation of
   property rights in social dilemmas may affect the extent to which people
   feel it is their social responsibility to further the collective's
   interest. In an experimental study we manipulated the presentation of
   property rights in Resource dilemmas and Public Good dilemmas. Initial
   property was either presented as collective property or presented as
   partitioned property. The results suggest that in Resource dilemmas,
   presenting initial property as partitioned property may have a negative
   effect on perceived social responsibility and (thus) on the maintenance
   of scarce resources. The presentation of initial property did not affect
   perceived social responsibility and choice behavior in Public Good
   dilemmas, however. The results are discussed and compared with previous
   research on property rights and framing in social dilemmas. (C) 1997

Title = {Interorganizational cooperation: The role of information technology - an

Journal = {INFORMATION SYSTEMS RESEARCH},
Year = {1997},
Volume = {8},
Number = {2},
Pages = {107-124},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {This paper explores the comparative and cumulative influence of a number
   of factors on the perceived level of cooperation in a dyadic
   relationship. Drawing upon the transaction costs economics, organization
   theory and information systems literatures, we hypothese three sets of
   key influences: (1) factors exogenous to the relationship, i.e., the
   characteristics of the environment within which the relationship
   operates, and factors endogeneous to the relationship including (2)
   economic and behavioral characteristics of the relationship, and (3)
   interorganizational information technology applications. These factors
   have been independently examined in separate research streams. A key
   contribution of this study is therefore to conceptually and empirically
   capture their collective influence on cooperation.
   We empirically test the five hypotheses we develop within the context of
   buyer-supplier relationships in the U.S. and Japanese automobile
   industries. Multiple regressions conducted on a data set of 447 distinct
   relationships indicate that the relational characteristics (i.e., the
   behavioral climate of the relationship) are the most robust predictor of
   cooperation in both countries when compared with other structural (e.g.,
   asset specificity) or technological factors (use of EDI-electronic data
   interchange). Environmental uncertainty (i.e., technological
   unpredictability) is positively associated with cooperation in Japanese
   supplier relations, which suggests that cooperation can act as an
   uncertainty absorption mechanism. Governance structure is a strong and
   significant predictor of cooperation in both samples, but with the
   opposite sign. Similarly, information technology (IT) does not play the
   same predictive role in the two country samples. Significant only in
   Japan it reflects an `electronic partnership' approach to the use of IT

Title = {Getting to know you: A theory of strategic group identity},
Journal = {STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT JOURNAL},
Year = {1997},
Volume = {18},
Number = {SI},
Pages = {165-186},

Abstract = {This paper develops a theory of strategic group identity that explains
   how strategic groups emerge in an industry and how they can affect firm
   behaviors and outcomes. In so doing, it provides a theoretical basis for
   the existence of strategic groups. We argue that managers cognitively
   partition their industry environment to reduce uncertainty and to cope
   with bounded rationality. Social learning theory and social
   identification theory are used to describe how cognitive groups coalesce
   into meaningful substructures and how a group-level identity emerges. We
   describe the ways in which macro level factors condition the development
   of groups and their identities. We introduce the notion of a strong
   identity, which characterizes any group sufficiently recognized and
   attended to by members to affect individual action. Groups with `weak
   identities' are no more than transient agglomerations of firms and do
   nor exist in any meaningful sense. These ideas are developed into
   propositions that describe the conditions under which groups with strong
   identities are likely to emerge. A second set of propositions describes
   their transformation over time. Identity strength is linked to both
   positive and negative outcomes in a final set of propositions. We show
   how strategic groups with strong identities can affect firm performance
   resolving a longstanding problem which has plagued strategic groups
   research and conclude by suggesting some approaches for measurement and
   future research. (C) 1997 by John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Title = {Metagraphs in hierarchical modeling},
Journal = {MANAGEMENT SCIENCE},
Year = {1997},
Volume = {43},
Number = {5},
Pages = {623-639},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {When using a decision support system (DSS) containing a large model
   base, a user has to decide which specific models are relevant for any
   particular task. When the model base is large and diverse, this task can
   be quite difficult. Furthermore, the number and variety of models
   available can be confusing. One way to simplify the user's interaction
   with the DSS, and facilitate more effective use of the system, is
   through the use of `'views'' of the model base. A view is an abstraction
   of a model base that limits attention to relationships between certain
   variables, and its purpose is to guide the development of DSS software
   that executes lower-level models in response to higher-level requests
   for information or analysis. Single views may be of use to individual
   decision makers who wish to abstract information from a model base, and
   multiple views may be of use to collections of decision makers who are
   using a model base to integrate their analyses to make a collective
   decision. In this paper, we show how representation of models using a
   graph theoretic structure called a metagraph can facilitate the
   construction and maintenance of model base views. In particular, we show
   how useful views can be constructed using a projection operation on a
   metagraph, and also present conditions under which views can be
   combined. The concepts developed in the paper are illustrated using an
   example from life cycle costing.},

Title = {More than you think: An inclusive estimate of business entries},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BUSINESS VENTURING},
Year = {1997},
Volume = {12},
Number = {3},
Pages = {175-196},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {The Wells Fargo/NFIB Series on Business Entries and Exits collected data
   throughout 1995 from 36,000 households regarding the business formation
   activity occurring among adults within those households. After adjusting
   for the 1.37 owners per firm and the 10\% of households with more than
   one entry, there were an estimated 4.553-million business entries in the
   12-month period involving 6.211 million active owners. Seventy-eight and
   one-half (78.5) percent of those businesses were de novo starts 20.0\%
   purchases and the remainder other forms of entry (including missing
   responses). Most of the entries were quite small whether started or
   purchased.
   The number of business entries is significantly larger than prior
   estimates. However, the 4.553-million figure, when dissected into
   component parts, is consistent with other measures of business entry.
   The primary reason for the larger estimate is that this research was
   able to capture the significant number of very small entries that either
   do not appear in other databases or appear only after a substantial
   delay.
   These new data offer a significantly expanded view of the American
   business population and its dynamics. More specifically they provide
   quantification of the smaller end of the entry scale, thereby
   introducing new population distributions and raising fundamental
   research and marketing questions about the unit of analysis (What is a
   business?) What constitutes a reasonable survey sample? To what
   population do we generalize survey data What are the market segments of
   the small-business population, and how do they differ What are the
   public policy requirements of these segments and how do they coincide
   and conflict And, what do real entry numbers tell us about the operation
   of the American economy on both a secular and cyclical basis?
   The foregoing are obvious. However, there are more subtle and perhaps
   more interesting questions. For example, the more people try To go into
   business for themselves, the more our collective (American) experience
   is influenced by the experience of business ownership. Small business
   draws enormous empathy from the American public; few Americans
   institutions are as popular. This is obviously a complex phenomenon.
   However, one explanation for its popularity is that so many Americans
   are exposed to business ownership either personally or through someone
   they know. Part of this research not yet published shows that
   small-business ownership pervades every class, income category, racial
   grouping, etc. The penetration of business formation into the American
   experience, therefore, is not only deep, it is also broad. And when its
   dimensions are so great the remaining issue is not the existence of
   influence bur its degree.
   If there are more starts than previously recognized, there must also be
   more exits. And if there are more exits, the dynamics of the business
   entry-exit process become even more tumultuous than previously
   recognized. Particularly for those interested in either policy or
   management, the question becomes, `'Why is exit so common?'' One path of
   inquiry leads to motivation for entry including career alternatives and
   income supplementation. To what extent do people intend to grow their
   businesses and to what extent do they intend their businesses to fill
   financial, occupational, or time gaps until{[} something better comes
   along? Another path of inquiry leads to resources. Do resource
   constraints or constraints of other natures impede business development?
   Then there is the issue of preparation. How well-prepared are entrants
   And, what reasonable steps can be taken to improve their assessments of
   potential opportunities or to effectively implement plans to capitalize
   on them? These are not necessarily new issues. But they become more
   conspicuous and pressing when the large number of exits is appreciated.
   The technique used to capture these data at a reasonable cost is called
   an `'omnibus'' or `'caravan'' survey. This survey technique is not
   well-known outside the commercial survey industry, but it presents
   considerable opportunity for researchers either with limited budgets or
   desirous of asking fewer than 10-15-minutes' worth of questions from a
   sample of the adult population. Its advantage is financial. Multiple
   sponsors can ask a limited number of proprietary questions at their own
   expense. But they then share the costs and results of reaching
   respondents and of asking the demographic questions, for example, age or
   sex of respondent. The current research posed two screen questions to
   all 36,000 households interviewed. The sponsors paid for those 72,000
   questions. But only about 2,000 respondents passed one of the screens.
   These respondents were led through several more questions. Thus, the
   sponsors paid just for the scr een questions and those questions
   administered to the 2,000. An extensive set of demographic data about
   the respondents was thrown in `'free.'' (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Inc.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH},
Year = {1997},
Volume = {23},
Number = {4},
Pages = {326-350},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {In the sociology of consumption, a core research issue is the symbolic
   expression, reproduction, and potential transformation of social
   collectivities through consumption. The two theoretical perspectives
   that have long dominated both consumer research and sociological
   investigations of this class of research questions-what I term
   personality/values lifestyle analysis and object signification
   research-have become less useful in the postmodern era. In this study, I
   develop an alternative poststructuralist approach for analyzing
   lifestyles, I describe five core principles of poststructuralist
   lifestyle analysis that distinguish this approach from the two
   predominant paradigms. Drawing from a series of unstructured interviews,
   I argue that each of these five features allows for more nuanced
   description of lifestyles than the two predominant approaches.
   Poststructuralist lifestyle analysis can be used to unravel the social
   patterning of consumption according to important social categories such
   as social class, gender, race/ethnicity, nationality, and generation in
   advanced capitalist countries in which postmodern cultural conditions
   make tracing these patterns difficult with conventional approaches.},

   placed in the role of CEO of the partner firm and asked whether they
   would engage in the alliance. Findings indicate that (1) reputation is a
   multidimensional construct, (2) the personal information-processing
   characteristics of the decision-maker mediate the reputation effect and
   may suppress the reputation information, (3) subjects may compensate
   weaker elements of reputation far stronger ones when making decisions,
   (4) product and management reputation are the most important factors,
   and (5) reputation is a factor affecting the decision regardless of
   whether the proposed target is a supplier or a competitor. (C) 1997 by

Abstract = {Effective international management requires knowledge of culturally

   argues that the cultural forces of individualism versus collectivism
   shape the self-concept, and by extension individual performance
   evaluation and feedback seeking, We present a comparative study to test
   the hypotheses that U.S. respondents desire success feedback (whereas
   Japanese and Chinese desire failure feedback), show more initiative and
   perceive more direct workplace feedback than do either Japanese or
   Chinese respondents, Strong support was found for comparisons between
   the U.S. and Japan, but the Chinese consistently departed from
   predictions, We interpret these results in terms of recent reforms in
   the People's Republic of China, and discuss implications of the study

Title = {Stories and experiments in social inquiry},
Journal = {ORGANIZATION STUDIES},
Year = {1997},
Volume = {18},
Number = {6},
Pages = {927-948},
Abstract = {The dualism between idiographic case study and nomothetic comparative
   research methods often pointed to is seen to be reconcilable through
   paying attention to the processes by which social inquiry attempts to
   achieve intersubjectivity within an experience collective. This
   collective consists of a three-way relationship between the inquirer who
   pursues a research question, actors who form the subject of the inquiry,
   and the audience(s) who are users of the outcomes of an inquiry.
   Conventionally, case studies are associated with an ethnographic
   tradition in which the inquirer acts more as a participant observer and
   narrator of a story, while comparative studies are seen to be associated
   with a natural science stance in which the inquirer is treated as a
   remote observer, interaction with the actors is seen as leading to bias
   and where the scientific experiment offers an ideal model. The paper
   discusses four generic types of inquiry - the exploratory case, the
   crucial experiment, the extensive experiment and the illustrative case -
   in terms of the degree of codification of method, the degree of
   criticality in relation to an existing theoretical paradigm, and a
   number of processes covering such matters as sampling, analysis and
   presentation of results. It is suggested that these processes provide a
   means of generating intersubjectivity within an `experience collective'
   in social inquiry, that can best proceed through an interplay between
   all four types of inquiry.},

Abstract = {This paper presents an evolutionary framework for horizontal technology
   policies (HTPs) especially market-friendly ones involving project-based
   incentives (e.g, R\&D project based grants rather than tax-based
   incentives to yearly expenditures on R\&D). HTPs are a category of
   technological policies whose objective is to promote technological
   development per se, and associated management and organizational
   routines, irrespective of industrial branch or technological area. They
   are being increasingly adopted by both advanced countries and newly
   industrialized countries in response to the new opportunities and
   threats opened up by the technological revolution and by the processes
   of liberalization and globalization; and they complement the more
   specific and well-known selective and vertical policies aimed at
   individual sectors and technologies. The analysis is conducted within a
   learning-to-innovate framework with emphasis on collective,
   organizational learning; search; and market-building. The outcome is a
   technology policy cycle with distinct infant, growth, and mature phases,
   Proactive `generation' of a critical mass of projects for efficient
   learning and diffusion of innovation routines becomes the aim of the
   infant phase; while the mature phase of the policy should focus on
   policy restructuring including drastic reductions in the support of
   routine projects and enhanced support of more complex types of
   innovation. The paper also emphasizes the importance of a neutrality
   component in incentives in the infant phase of increasing selectivity;
   and of building policy capabilities for efficient policy design and
   implementation.},

Abstract = {This paper examines institution building and the problems of collective
   action that must be overcome so that institutions can regulate the
   self-interested activity of organizations and facilitate the production
   or protection of resources that collectively benefit organizations. We
   show that the presence of competing groups of organizations is key to
   institution building because it may allow cooperating organizations to
   gain relative competitive advantage over other organizations and because
   the presence of salient rivals facilitates collective action, We use the
   history of tourism institutions at Niagara Falls to illuminate the
   collective action problems, and their solutions, associated with
   building institutions. We propose that (1) institution building in this
   context was the result of collective action among competitors to solve a
   common problem, (2) rivalry and competition between hotels on either
   side of the falls enhanced collective action among locally competing
   hotels, and (3) the regulation provided by the institutions lowered the
   failure rates and increased the founding rates of hotels on both sides
   of the falls. We examined these propositions first through historical
   analysis to show the motivation and process of building institutions and
   then through analysis of hotel failure and founding rates to show the
   presence of interpopulation competition and the influence over time of
   the institutions on organizational populations, Our analysis of failure
   and founding rates indicates that Niagara Falls hotels did benefit from
   the institutions they helped create and that there were two competing
   groups of organizations, but, surprisingly, institutions helped all
   Niagara Falls hotels, regardless of which group created them.},

Abstract = {This article contributes to debate on the measurement of organizational
   climate. Use of means cloaks wide variations in individual perceptions.
   Use of clustering techniques to identify groups of people who see
   climate in a similar way has been questioned because such
   `'collectives'' may not represent meaningful sociopsychological groups.
   The present work is based on the view that meaningful collectives are
   most likely to emerge when people work together on common tasks in
   relatively isolated and defined physical locations. In an organization
   in which such conditions exist, a clustering technique largely failed to
   identify meaningful social collectives.},

Abstract = {Knowledge is too problematic a concept to make the task of building a
   dynamic knowledge-based theory of the firm easy. We must also
   distinguish the theory from the resource-based and evolutionary views.
   The paper begins with a multitype epistemology which admits both the
   pre- and subconscious modes of human knowing and, reframing the concept
   of the cognizing individual, the collective knowledge of social groups.
   While both Nelson and Winter, and Nonaka and Takeuchi, successfully
   sketch theories of the dynamic interactions of these types of
   organizational knowledge, neither indicates how they are to be
   contained. Callon and Latour suggest knowledge itself is dynamic and
   contained within actor networks, so moving us from knowledge as a
   resource toward knowledge as a process. To simplify this approach, we
   revisit sociotechnical systems theory, adopt three heuristics from the
   social constructionist literature, and make a distinction between the
   systemic and component attributes of the actor network. The result is a
   very different mode of theorizing, less an objective statement about the
   nature of firms `out there' than a tool to help managers discover their
   place in the firm as a dynamic knowledge-based activity system.},

Abstract = {This article first presents a review of the development of different
   types of domestic enterprises: state-owned enterprise (SOEs),
   collective-owned enterprises (COEs), and other enterprises (OEs), which
   include mainly private enterprises. Compared with other transition
   economies, COEs are actually an important source of China's rapid
   economic growth. They are `'vaguely defined cooperatives'' without a
   well-defined ownership structure. There is no equivalent organizational
   structure similar to COEs in Western economies.
   The purpose of this article is to study the empirical relationship
   between the size of domestic enterprises including state-owned
   enterprises, collective-owned enterprises, and other enterprises and
   their firm dynamics (growth) by investigating whether they grow
   according to Gibrat's Law. The majority of COEs and OEs were formed
   after the economic reform. The rapid growth of these non-state
   enterprises, especially COEs, is actually the driving force behind the
   rapid development of the industrial sector. Our empirical results
   suggest that Gibrat's Law does not hold for all types of enterprises
   (the rejection is especially strong for COEs). Moreover, small
   enterprises are growing faster than their larger counterparts in terms
   of employment and output.},

Volume = {68},
Number = {1},
Pages = {44-57},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Collective induction is the cooperative search for descriptive,
   predictive, and explanatory generalizations, rules, and principles.
   Intergroup collective induction occurs when groups work separately on a
   common problem but exchange hypotheses and evidence. Two separated
   four-person groups exchanged hypotheses and evidence on each trial in
   the solution of the same rule induction problem (Exchange Condition) or
   solved the problem independently (No Exchange Condition). A theory of
   intragroup collective induction (Laughlin \& Hollingshead,
   Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes, 1995) predicted
   the probabilities of group hypotheses for distributions of member
   hypotheses better than five other plausible models, although all six
   models could be rejected. Aggregating over 400 groups in the current and
   three previous experiments, the predictions of the theory could not be
   rejected whereas the other five models could confidently be rejected. A
   formal analysis distinguishes unidirectional and bidirectional
   instigative and supportive influence by correct, plausible, and
   nonplausible hypotheses. There was weak evidence in the Exchange
   Condition for instigative influence by correct hypotheses when one group
   received the correct hypothesis from the other, and strong evidence for
   mutually supportive influence when both groups simultaneously proposed
   the correct hypothesis and received it from the other group. (C) 1996

Volume = {74},

Pages = {92-\&},
Month = {SEP-OCT},
Abstract = {Thousands of businesses have reengineered work to focus employees on
   processes that clearly provide value to customers. They have done away
   with their functional silos and created process-complete departments,
   each able to perform all the cross-functional tasks required to meet
   customers' needs. Although many of those efforts have paid off in the
   form of lower costs, shorter cycle times, and greater customer
   satisfaction, many others have resulted in disappointment.
   What went wrong? In some companies, managers may have underestimated
   mated the actions necessary to transform the way employees work with one
   another. Many of them may have assumed that simply switching to
   process-complete departments would forge people instantly into a team.
   The authors argue that this assumption is wrong. In a study of U.S.
   electronics manufacturers, they found that process-complete departments
   had faster cycle times than functional departments only when their
   managers had used one or more of four ways to cultivate collective
   responsibility: structuring jobs with overlapping responsibilities,
   basing rewards on unit performance, laying out the work area so that
   people can see one another's work, and designing procedures so that
   employees with different jobs are better able to collaborate.
   The particular method or number of methods employed did not seem to
   matter. What did was whether a company had adopted any of them. And it:
   mattered considerably: process-complete departments that had embraced
   one or more of the methods had significantly faster cycle times than
   those that hadn't.},

Title = {Crossing mother: Entrepreneur-franchisees' attempts to reduce franchisor
   influence},

Note = {Conference on Franchising - A Gateway to Cooperative Entrepreneurship,
   GEORGIA INST TECHNOL, ATLANTA, GA, JAN 19-21, 1996},
Abstract = {Contractual terms guide many entrepreneur-franchisees' actions with the
   franchisor. However, it is impossible for franchisors to completely
   specify all future actions. They compensate by continually attempting to
   influence franchisees, using what franchisees perceive as suasion in
   their ongoing inter actions. We develop a theoretical framework for
   understanding the informal interaction dynamics between franchisors and
   franchisees.
   Most franchise arrangements include the payment of royalties based on
   sales. This encourages a growth-oriented strategy, usually appropriate
   for the franchisees during the initial stages of their operations.
   Whereas a franchising strategy can reduce entreprenerial risk for
   franchisees, it does not eliminate it. Thus, as sales of the franchisees
   increase, profit-oriented strategies will be favored because they
   represent the payoffs that accrue to continuing entrepreneurial effort
   and risk-taking. These strategies may be in opposition to franchisors'
   safes orientation when market conditions do not allow continual growth
   without margin penalties. A research model is developed, depicting the
   relationship between franchisees' strategies and performance, and the
   moderating effect that contractual goals and franchisees' perception of
   franchisors' attempts at suasion have on this relationship. A set of
   research hypotheses was then empirically tested using a large sample of
   franchisees from the commercial truck retailing industry.
   The results indicate that sales-growth and profit-growth goals are not
   always congruent. Balancing the goals of the franchisor and franchisee
   did nor appear to be a popular option; either one or the other was
   emphasized. More importantly, the results indicate that when franchisees
   perceive attempts by franchisors to rise suasion, lower levels of
   profits result, brit there is no corresponding increase in the level of
   sales.
   In the long-term, franchisors are likely to determine that current
   contractual arrangements are not protecting their longer term interests.
   Thus, they will be expected to attempt to modify franchise contracts in
   ways that force franchisees to implement sales-gain strategies. This
   will require that entrepreneur-franchisees anticipate future events more
   carefully at the time they are examining the original franchise
   contract. Because most entrepreneurs are concerned with immediate
   survival at the start-rtp stage, this makes examination of the contract
   less likely to happen; the franchise option is attractive because it
   reduces such risks.
   We recommend that entrepreneurs write er ante contingent claims
   contracts that ensure a gradual reduction of franchisor influence.
   Although this would assume a power or knowledge balance that favors the
   franchisees, which is unlikely driving the start-rip phase, it will
   change over time as franchisees gain a better understanding of the local
   competitive dynamics. Thus, it may well serve the franchisees to take a
   defensive posture or push a royalty arrangement that decreases the
   emphasis on sales over time. This is most likely to be effective,where
   the entrepreneur is considering several competing franchises at the time
   of the signing of the contract.
   Finally, we recommend that entrepreneur-franchisees should nor assume
   that the expert advice offered by their franchisor is always in their
   best interests. Although technical advice is more likely to be unbiased
   and should be fully exploited, as this is what makes the franchise
   valuable, strategic advice, or that which relates to goal setting may
   well be colored by the financial interests of the franchisor.
   Franchisors are unlikely to consider the possibility that franchisees
   would be better served by formulating their own strategies, nor are they
   likely to consider that the franchise network would be better off; in
   the longer term, by the collective impact associated with numerous
   franchisees independently formulating their own strategies. in short,
   although we do not suggest that franchisees should always assume that
   `'crossing mother'' is the best response to all perceived
   franchisor-suasion efforts, they should carefully examine all strategic
   advice.},

   commentaries that even potential critics of the campaign were drawn into
   acceptance of a common agenda and have been thereby diverted from
   addressing other pressing issues affecting women's opportunities. This
   analysis draws upon a conceptual scheme which is concerned with ways in
   which cycles of cognition, action, and outcome collectively actualize
   social structures, a process referred to as social enactment. We explore
   how a conventional discourse reinforces enactment processes supporting
   prevailing structures while new discourse offers the potential for

Abstract = {This study helps to explain why measured school inputs appear to have
   little effect on student outcomes, particularly for cohorts educated
   since 1960. Teachers' unionization can explain how public schools
   simultaneously can have more generous inputs and worse student
   performance. Using panel data on United States school districts, I
   identify the effect of teachers' unionization through differences in the
   timing of collective bargaining, especially timing determined by the
   passage of state laws that facilitate teachers' unionization. I find
   that teachers' unions increase school inputs but reduce productivity
   sufficiently to have a negative overall effect on student performance.

Abstract = {In recent years there has been an increased interest in the application
   of Aristotelian virtue to business ethics. The objective of this paper
   is to describe the moral and intellectual virtues defined by Aristotle
   and the types of pedagogy that might be used to integrate virtue ethics
   into the business curriculum. Virtues are acquired human qualities, the
   excellences of character, which enable a person to achieve the good
   life. In business, the virtues facilitate successful cooperation and
   enable the community to achieve its collective goals. The cultivation of
   virtue in students requires imparting knowledge about virtue and
   training students to be virtuous. A variety of instructional techniques
   are discussed including using case studies, collaborative and
   cooperative learning, role-playing, and video presentations. Business
   educators should emphasize to students that virtue considerations apply
   both to possible actions they may take and to themselves as moral
   agents. Since faculty may be viewed as role models, it is especially
   important that they set proper standards of behavior for students to
   emulate.},

   the defining attributes of social traps in diversity cont texts. (b)
   links human resource initiatives with a taxonomy of social trap

Title = {Goal orientation in organizational research: A conceptual and empirical
   foundation},
Journal = {ORGANIZATIONAL BEHAVIOR AND HUMAN DECISION PROCESSES},
Year = {1996},
Volume = {67},
Number = {1},
Pages = {26-48},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Although some have argued that goal orientation could be beneficially
   integrated into organizational research, progress in this area has been
   impeded by several problematic conceptual issues and a lack of validated
   dispositional measures. This research was intended to address these
   issues and to provide a foundation for future organizational research in
   this area. We argue that goal orientation is a two-dimensional construct
   that has both dispostional and situational components. In each of four
   independent studies, LISREL VIII confirmatory factor analyses (Joreskog
   \& Sorbom, 1993) illustrated that a two-factor model fit a set of goal
   orientation items better than a single-factor model. In addition, the
   latent goal orientations were found to be uncorrelated in each study.
   Moreover, correlational analyses indicated that demographic and
   substantive variables exhibited differential relationships with the
   latent learning goal and performance goal orientation constructs. Other
   analyses illustrated that the dispositional and situational aspects of
   goal orientation are distinguishable. Collectively, the results provided
   ample support for the convergent and discriminant validity of eight-item
   measures of each goal orientation and help to define the nomological
   network within which the two goal orientations reside. The importance of
   goal orientation as a multidimensional construct is discussed and
   several recommendations for further research are suggested. (C) 1996

Title = {A qualitative study of managerial challenges facing small business
   geographic expansion},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BUSINESS VENTURING},
Year = {1996},
Volume = {11},
Number = {4},
Pages = {233-256},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Geographic expansion is a common growth strategy used by small,
   entrepreneurial firms. Yet, despite the importance of geographic
   expansion as a growth strategy, it is a neglected area of small business
   research. To date, research in the area of small business growth has
   focused on broad issues, such as the common `'obstacles'' to firm growth
   and the relationship between firm growth and firm profitability. Whereas
   this literature is suggestive, it does not provide specific prescriptive
   advice to small business managers pursuing geographic expansion as a
   growth strategy.
   As a first step in generating prescriptive advice in this area, this
   study examined the managerial challenges that faced one small firm
   during the early stages of its efforts to expand geographically. The
   subject organization, referred to as the Local Advertising Company
   (LAG), operated in a single location from 1968 to 1990. As a means to
   initiate firm growth, the owners of the company opened eight new
   locations in 1991 and eight more in 1992. However, problems ensued. This
   study used a qualitative research methodology to conduct an assessment
   of the managerial challenges facing the LAC during its geographic
   expansion effort.
   Seventeen key employees of LAC were interviewed for the study. The
   qualitative case study methodology used provided an opportunity to
   gather in-depth information from informants regarding their individual
   assessment of the managerial challenges encountered by LAC during its
   geographic expansion. Collectively, the respondents identified a number
   of specific management issues that became problematic during LACS
   geographic expansion effort. Through a content analysis technique, these
   issues were organized into 15 thematic categories including training,
   recruitment and selection, the relationship between the field staff and
   the original owners, and 12 others. Each of these categories represents
   the separate managerial challenges faced by the company during its
   geographic expansion.
   The study provides a descriptive analysis of each of the 15 categories
   of managerial challenges that emerged. The research results suggest that
   the successful management of a geographic expansion growth strategy
   requires managers to deal with a unique set of issues. For example, the
   training of new employees may become problematic when the most
   experienced personnel in the limit reside in the home office and the new
   trainees are located in widely dispersed geographic locations.
   In addition, the results of the study provide an extension to both
   practical and theoretical knowledge in three distinct areas: planning
   for growth, managing growth, and the reasons for growth. First, the
   results of the study support the importance of planning for growth, but
   suggest that planning must be complemented by learning and a willingness
   to evolve one's plan as growth progresses. In terms of the management of
   growth, the case shows that running a small business and growing a small
   business do not include the same skill set. The owners of LAC had been
   quite successful managing their single location for 22 years. However,
   this ability to run a business did not complement the need to anticipate
   start-up problems in new, remote sites, which is inherent in a strategy
   of geographic expansion. In addition, the case demonstrated that the
   management of growth requires a cognizance on the part of the original
   owners of a firm to delegate control. Finally, with regard to the
   reasons for growth, researchers generally characterize firm growth as
   being motivated by either economic (e. g., economies of scale) or
   emotional reasons (e.g., employing family members). The owners of LAC
   initiated firm growth for the purpose of wealth creation to fund their
   retirements. This illustrates that firm growth; can be motivated by a
   combination of both economic (e.g., wealth creation) and personal (e.g.,
   retirement security) reasons.},

Abstract = {The business value of information technology (IT) has been debated for a
   number of years. While some authors have attributed large productivity
   improvements and substantial consumer benefits to IT, others report that
   IT has not had any bottom line impact on business profitability. This
   paper focuses on the fact that while productivity, consumer value, and
   business profitability are related they are ultimately separate
   questions. Accordingly, the empirical results on IT value depend heavily
   on which question is being addressed and what data are being used.
   Applying methods based on economic theory, we are able to define and
   examine the relevant hypotheses for each of these three questions, using
   recent firm-level data on IT spending by 370 large firms. Our findings
   indicate that IT has increased productivity and created substantial
   value for consumers. However, we do not find evidence that these
   benefits have resulted in supranormal business profitability. We
   conclude that while modeling techniques need to be improved, these
   results are collectively consistent with economic theory. Thus, there is
   no inherent contradiction between increased productivity, increased
   consumer value, and unchanged business profitability.},

Volume = {66},

Abstract = {A social dilemma is a situation in which members of a group are faced
   with a conflict between two choices: maximizing personal interests
   (defection) or maximizing collective interests (cooperation). It is
   generally more profitable to defect, but if all do so, all are worse off
   than if all choose to cooperate. A public goods dilemma is a special
   case of a social dilemma in which people must contribute resources to
   provide a public good. Communication, especially face-to-face
   discussion, has been shown to be effective in facilitating cooperation
   in such situations, including asking members to make a pledge to
   contribute (cooperate). The purpose of this study was to evaluate some
   explanations for the effectiveness of a pledge in enhancing cooperation.
   Two hundred and fifty-six undergraduate students (in groups of four
   subjects) were asked to make choices in a public goods dilemma. The
   results suggest that a pledge is effective in enhancing cooperation
   because it induces group identity and the perception of criticality. It
   is suggested that when face-to-face discussion is not feasible, a pledge
   system may be effective in solving real life social dilemmas. (C) 1996

Title = {Understanding organizational learning capability},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT STUDIES},
Year = {1996},
Volume = {33},
Number = {3},
Pages = {361-379},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {This paper presents data on how learning takes place in four
   organizations, what gets learned, and the factors and processes that
   facilitate or impede learning. Seven orientations for describing
   organizational learning capability and understanding learning styles are
   identified. Each of these orientations is conceived as a bi-polar
   continuum that reflect learning processes.
   Knowledge source is defined as the extent to which an organization
   prefers to develop new knowledge internally versus the extent to which
   it is more likely to seek inspiration in ideas developed externally.
   Product-process focus refers to a preference for the accumulation of
   knowledge related to product and service outcomes versus a preference to
   invest in knowledge about basic processes that support products.
   Documentation mode refers to attitudes as to what constitutes knowledge
   and to the repositories of knowledge that are supported. Dissemination
   mode pertains to the difference between establishing an atmosphere in
   which learning evolves and one in which a more structured, controlled
   approach is taken to induce learning. Learning focus has to do with
   whether learning is concentrated on methods and tools to improve what is
   already being done versus testing the assumptions underlying what is
   being done. Value-chain focus indicates which functional, core
   competencies are valued and supported. Skill development focus involves
   the orientation toward individual versus collective learning.
   Organizational learning may be increased by building on existing
   capabilities or developing new ones. The latter involves a change in
   culture, the former involves improving current capabilities.
   Organizations can enhance their learning capability through either
   approach.},

Title = {The evolution of intracorporate domains: Divisional charter losses in
   high-technology, multidivisional corporations},
Journal = {ORGANIZATION SCIENCE},

Abstract = {Modern corporations have become synonymous with the multidivisional form
   of organization. Variously interdependent divisions are `'chartered'' to
   look after one or more business areas, in effect defining the `'turf''
   of the division and its purpose within the corporation, and collectively
   defining the corporate domain. However, once created, these divisional
   charters should not be regarded as rigid; they are susceptible to
   change. Particularly in fast-paced environments, such as in
   high-technology industries, divisional charters are liable to change as
   divisions add or subtract businesses to their charter responsibilities.
   These charter changes are seen as an adaptive device for large,
   multidivisional corporations in fast-paced environments.
   This paper presents a process model of how divisions change their
   domains in hypercompetitive contexts, focusing on the specific question
   of how divisions lose all or portions of their business charters. The
   paper is based on a larger inductive study of charter changes in ten
   divisions, both domestic and foreign, of a large, multinational,
   high-technology corporation. Data were collected over an 18-month period
   and included formal interviews, questionnaires, company documents, group
   interviews, media publications and direct observations of strategy
   formation sessions. Over 80 informants were interviewed across several
   managerial levels.
   Our data revealed three distinct patterns and logics of charter loss
   depending upon what phase of core business development a division found
   itself: (1) Divisions starting-up new core businesses lost these
   charters because of a combination of their failure in the new area and
   competition with other divisions in the company-the process revealed a
   competitive market for new charters; (2) Divisions rapidly growing new
   core businesses lost peripheral business areas in order to focus on the
   core business-the process emphasized a focus logic for charter change;
   finally (3) Divisions with mature charter areas were found to shed their
   core business areas because of an emerging misfit between their skills
   and culture and the nature of competition in the industry-the process
   emphasized the emerging nature of corporate misalignment and the abrupt
   charter changes that can follow. This paper contributes to
   organizational theory by exploring the evolution of large, diversified
   corporations, focusing on the organizational responses to fast-moving,
   competitive environments. It also contributes to strategy by revealing a
   `'re-combinant'' multidivisional organizational form, by which timely
   charter changes can be used by large corporations to keep pace in these
   turbulent contexts.},

Abstract = {We study the collective choice of fiscal policy in a `'federation'' with
   two levels of government. Local policy redistributes across individuals
   and affects the probability of aggregate shocks, whereas federal policy
   shares international risk. There is a tradeoff between risk-sharing and
   moral hazard: federal risk-sharing may induce local governments to enact
   policies that increase local risk. We analyze this tradeoff under
   alternative fiscal constitutions. In particular, we contrast a
   vertically ordered system like the EC with a horizontally ordered
   federal system like the US. Alternative arrangements create different
   incentives for policymakers and voters, and give rise to different
   political equilibria. Under appropriate institutions, centralization of
   functions and power can mitigate the moral hazard problem.},

Title = {Young men and fire - Maclean,N},
Journal = {HARVARD BUSINESS REVIEW},
Year = {1996},
Volume = {74},
Number = {3},
Pages = {143-\&},
Month = {MAY-JUN},
Abstract = {Increasingly, work in today's corporations unfolds in small, temporary
   groups where the stakes are high, turnover is chronic, foul-ups can
   spread, and the unexpected is common. Karl Weick finds lessons for
   senior managers watching over such groups in an unusual source: Norman
   Maclean's 1992 book, Young Men and Fire, which reconstructs the
   circumstances of a deadly fire in Montana's Mann Gulch that claimed the
   lives of 13 young men.
   Weick recounts the basic details of the tragedy as they are provided by
   Maclean: On a hot August day in 1949, 15 trained firefighters - smoke
   jumpers-parachuted into remote Mann Gulch to bring under control what
   they thought was a fairly routine blaze. They had help from one man
   already on the scene. However, within two hours of landing in the gulch,
   all but three of the men were dead - consumed by flames. The small fire
   had `'blown up'' and chased the men at terrifying speed up the steep
   slope, eventually catching most of them.
   In the midst of the disaster, several things happened to the smoke
   jumpers' crew: Its structure broke down, confusion prevailed, and the
   men forgot their roles as firefighters. Weick believes that corporate
   leaders can learn from this example by developing groups capable of
   improvisation, wise behavior, respectful interaction, and communication.
   He explains how those things were missing that afternoon at Mann Gulch
   and why they are important to organizations today. When they are
   present, says Weick, small groups can function as resilient sources of
   what he calls collective sense making. In short, they can create a
   social context in which, decisions evolve before a dangerous situation
   blows up.},

Title = {Technology strategy and financial performance: Examining the moderating
   role of the firm's competitive environment},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BUSINESS VENTURING},
Year = {1996},
Volume = {11},
Number = {3},
Pages = {189-219},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Success in today's competitive environment requires a company to pursue
   a coherent technology strategy to articulate its plans to develop,
   acquire, and deploy technological resources to achieve superior
   financial performance. This strategy clarifies the company's choices on:
   being a technological pioneer or a follower, the breadth of the
   technology product and process portfolios, amounts of investments in
   internal R\&D and external sources of technology, and level of
   technological forecasting to be performed In turn, these choices require
   making decisions on the basic and applied R\&D to be conduced, the
   intended offensive or defensive uses of the technology, and emphasis on
   incremental and radical R\&D.
   To date, however few studies have attempted to document the collective
   implications of a company's technological choices for its financial
   performance. In response, data from 176 manufacturing companies were
   used to examine the association between a company's technology strategy
   and its financial performance and to explore the moderating effect of
   the environment on the technology strategy-performance link. Therefore,
   the study focused on a company's perceptions of environmental dynamism,
   hostility, and heterogeneity. Dynamism indicated the perceived
   continuity of changes in art industry. Hostility referred to the changes
   in the industry that could adversely impact the firm's operations and
   performance. Heterogeneity meant that the environment encompassed many
   segments with different needs. The study developed and empirically
   tested the following hypotheses:
   H1a: pioneering will be highest among firms whose environments are
   highly dynamic, moderately hostile, and moderately heterogeneous.
   H1b: Followership will be highest among firms whose environments are
   highly hostile and moderately dynamic but low in heterogeneity.
   H2a: Radical product technologies will be pursued most by firms whose
   environments are highly dynamic, moderately hostile, and moderately
   heterogeneous.
   H2b: Radical process technologies will be pursued most by firms whose
   environments are moderately dynamic, moderately hostile, and moderately
   heterogeneous.
   H2c: Incremental product and process technologies will be pursued most
   by firms whose environments are stable (low dynamism), benign (low
   hostility), and highly heterogeneous.
   H3: The broadest technological portfolios will exist among firms whose
   environments are characterized by moderate dynamism, high heterogeneity,
   and moderate or low hostility.
   H4: R\&D spending will be highest among firms whose environments are
   highly dynamic, highly heterogeneous, and highly benign (low in
   hostility).
   H5: The use of external technology sources will be highest among firms
   whose environments are highly dynamic, highly hostile, and highly
   heterogeneous.
   H6: Emphasis on technological forecasting will be highest among firms
   whose environments are highly dynamic, highly hostile, and highly
   heterogeneous.
   H7: The environment is a quasi-moderator of the technology
   strategy-performance relationship.
   The results supported the study's hypotheses except H2c and H3 and
   suggested five ideas for managerial action. (I) Executives should
   develop and use a comprehensive technology strategy to ensure that their
   company achieves superior financial performance. (2) Executives should
   be cautious in applying generic prescriptions of how to utilize
   technological resources to achieve profitability, because the financial
   payoff from technology strategy variables varies from one environment to
   the other. Instead, executives should examine their company's goals,
   capacity to manage diverse product and process initiatives, risk-taking
   orientation, resources, and the environment (3) Attention to developing
   and using process technology innovation is necessary for success. In
   fact, a broad process innovation portfolio is positively associated with
   return on assets in the overall sample and in three of the study's five
   clusters. (4) Managers need to adopt a long-term perspective in making
   R\&D investments, where patient investments over several years are the
   norm. Increasing R\&D spending should nor be viewed as a quick fix for
   the company's poor competitive position. (5) Whereas the external
   sources of technology can improve the company's performance, managers
   should identify the conditions under which external sources can be used
   and educate their employees on the growing importance of these
   technologies for achieving profitability.},

Abstract = {This paper examines how, in the presence of individual risk, economic
   efficiency can be achieved without an unrealistically large number of
   contingent claims. Market uncertainty is specified in such a way that
   general types of individual risk and collective risk are properly
   accounted for and so that, specifically, market clearing is always
   satisfied ex post as well as ex ante. We show that consistency of
   beliefs and optimality of allocation can be guaranteed with an
   appropriate array of pure Arrow securities to spread collective risk and
   mutual insurance policies to pool individual risk. When there is
   individual risk common to like groups of individuals, pooling risk by
   means of mutual insurance permits substantial economizing on market
   transactions, as compared to those required if dealing instead with the
   full complement of pure Arrow securities. We show that if there are N
   households (consisting of H types), each facing the possibility of being
   in S individual states together with T collective states, then ensuring
   Pareto optimality requires only H(S - 1)T independent mutual insurance
   policies plus T pure Arrow securities. Our results also help to clarify
   the question of which missing markets may affect allocational
   efficiency.},

   targetings in the 1990s. For the vast majority of firms, there are no

   firms subject to nonproxy proposal targeting, however, experiences a
   significant positive wealth effect. There is no evidence of significant
   long-term improvement in either stock price or accounting measures of
   performance in the post-targeting period, Collectively, these results
   cast doubt on the effectiveness of pension fund activism as a substitute
   for an active market for corporate control.},

Abstract = {This paper examines the impact of technological innovation on wages
   using a panel of British firms. A head-count measure of major
   innovations between 1945 and 1983 is combined with share price and
   accounting information Innovating firms are found to have higher average
   wages, but rival innovation tends to depress own wages. This appears
   consistent with a model where wages are partly determined by a sharing
   in the rents generated by innovation. In other words, innovation may be
   a good instrument for proxies for rents such as profitability, quasi
   rents, or Tobin's (average) Q. Instrumental variable estimates of the
   elasticity between wages and quasi rents are about 0.29.},

Abstract = {Management fashion setters disseminate management fashions, transitory
   collective beliefs that certain management techniques are at the
   forefront of management progress. These fashion setters-consulting
   firms, management gurus, business mass-media publications, and business
   schools-do not simply force fashions onto gullible managers. To sustain
   their images as fashion setters, they must lead in a race (a) to sense
   the emergent collective preferences of managers for new management
   techniques, (b) to develop rhetorics that describe these techniques as
   the forefront of management progress, and (c) to disseminate these
   rhetorics back to managers and organizational stakeholders before other
   fashion setters. Fashion setters who fall behind in this race (e.g.,
   business schools or certain scholarly professional societies) are
   condemned to be perceived as lagging rather than leading management
   progress, as peripheral to the business community, and as undeserving of
   societal support. This article is not a plea for business school
   scholars to become slaves to management fashion. Rather, it urges these
   scholars not only to study the management-fashion-setting process and to
   explain when and how it fails to serve shareholders, employees,
   managers, students, and other stakeholders, but also to intervene in
   this process in order to render it a more technically useful, collective

Title = {Sequential choice in a step-level public goods dilemma: The effects of

Journal = {ORGANIZATIONAL BEHAVIOR AND HUMAN DECISION PROCESSES},
Year = {1996},
Volume = {65},
Number = {1},
Pages = {37-47},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {A social dilemma is a situation in which members of a group or
   organization are faced with a conflict between two choices: maximize
   personal interests (defection) or maximize collective interests
   (cooperation). It is generally more profitable to defect, but if all do
   so, all are worse off than if all choose to cooperate. Previous research
   indicate that criticality and uncertainty affect the likelihood of
   cooperation. The more a member perceives that her choice is critical
   (has a significant impact on the outcome), the greater the likelihood of
   cooperation; conversely, the greater the uncertainty about the outcome,
   the lower the likelihood of cooperation. A sequential social dilemma
   paradigm was developed to manipulate criticality and uncertainty
   systematically. Using college students as subjects, two experiments were
   conducted. In both experiments (based on four- and six-person groups),
   criticality interacted with uncertainty: When criticality was high,
   cooperation decreased with uncertainty; but when criticality was low,
   there was a slight increase of cooperation rates with uncertainty.
   Several hypotheses are proposed to explain these results. (C) 1996

Journal = {HARVARD BUSINESS REVIEW},
Year = {1996},
Volume = {74},
Number = {1},
Pages = {99-\&},
Month = {JAN-FEB},
Abstract = {How real is the private-label threat to branded products? What should
   national-brand manufacturers do about it?
   On the one hand, manufacturers have reason to be concerned. There are
   more private labels on the market than ever before; collectively, unit
   shares of store-brand goods place first, second, ore third in 177 of 250
   supermarket product categories in the United States. But many
   manufacturers have not fully recognized two important points in
   considering this threat.
   First, private-label market share generally goes up when the economy is
   suffering and down in stronger economic periods. In the depth of the
   1981-1982 recession, it peaked at 17\% of sales; in 1994, when private
   labels received great media attention, it was more than two percentage
   points lower at 14.8\%. Second, manufacturers of brand-name products can
   have significant influence on the seriousness of the challenge posed by
   private-label goods. In fact, in large part, they can control it.
   It is difficult for managers to look at a competitive threat objectively
   and in a long-term context when day-to-day performance is suffering. But
   the authors strongly advocate keeping the private-label challenge in
   perspective. To help managers gain this perspective, they analyze recent
   developments that have boosted the private-label market. Then they
   highlight the considerable strengths of the brand name. Managers at
   brand manufacturers are cautioned about their own reliance on
   private-label production; those that have not entered that market are
   counseled not to do so. Finally, the authors offer winning strategies
   that manufacturers can use to fight private labels and maintain the
   long-term health of their brands.},

   paper thus studies the joint dynamics of individual and collective
   reputations and derives the existence of stereotypes from history
   dependence rather than from a multiplicity of equilibria or from the
   existence of a common trait as is usually done in the literature. It
   shows that new members of an organization may suffer from an original
   sin of their elders long after the latter are gone, and it derives
   necessary and sufficient conditions under which group reputations can be
   rebuilt. Last, the paper applies the theory to analyse when a large firm
   can maintain a reputation for quality.},

Volume = {73},
Number = {6},

Month = {NOV-DEC},
Abstract = {A decade of process improvement has transformed the way most
   corporations operate and, at the same time, the job of the senior
   executive. Top-down autocrats are out and bottom-up teams are in. The
   message seems to be: Get the processes right, and the company will
   manage itself. But this message belies a simple truth: Managers, not
   processes, run companies. In fact, process-focused companies need move
   top-down management, not less. However, today's activist executives must
   operate very differently from executives of the past. Given the
   complexities of modern business competition, no single individual can do
   all that it takes to achieve success for a company. Success depends on
   the willingness and ability of the entire senior executive group to
   address not just their individual functional or divisional
   responsibilities but also their collective responsibility for the
   company as a whole. Only senior managers can rise above the details of
   the business, recognize emerging patterns, make unexpected connections,
   and identify the points of maximum leverage for action.
   In fact, a study on innovation practices at some 550 American, European,
   and Japanese companies across a wide variety of industries has shown

Title = {The appeal and difficulties of participative systems},
Journal = {ORGANIZATION SCIENCE},
Year = {1995},
Volume = {6},
Number = {6},
Pages = {603-627},
Month = {NOV-DEC},
Abstract = {One can identify compelling reasons for private and public organizations
   to embrace participative systems. Scholars and organizational
   consultants maintain that organizations need such systems to prosper in
   an increasingly competitive and turbulent world, and that such changes
   are now taking place. Yet, participative techniques have diffused
   minimally. Why is there such a discrepancy between the endorsements and
   adoption of participative methods, despite the strong arguments for them
   and their intuitive appeal?
   This paper maintains that barriers to participative systems are embedded
   in social, economic, and political principles deeply valued in their own
   right. Writings on participative systems treat these barriers as
   difficult problems that can be overcome through patient, well-designed
   behavioral and organizational interventions. In contrast, we suggest
   that the structures and attitudes impeding participative systems are
   usually valued more highly than the prospective gains from the systems,
   and that, in the future, true participative systems will have difficulty
   sustaining themselves in an organizational landscape that continues to
   favor systems of centralized control. Similar impediments operating in
   areas as different as management and government regulation suggest basic
   processes that rise above specific contexts.
   The paper draws on two pertinent but heretofore disconnected scholarly
   literatures-the literatures on cooperation and on collaboration-to
   analyze the experiences with participative systems in management and
   regulatory policy. Four themes-prior dispositions toward cooperation,
   social and political organization, the nature of purposes, issues, and
   values, and leadership capacity and style-are critical to understanding
   each area. Generally, participative systems bump into problems of
   collective action: dispositions against cooperating with prior
   adversaries, the costs of collaboration in complex social and political
   systems, the difficulties of engaging deep conflicts, and leadership
   incentives favoring control that develop in this context. These
   conditions repeatedly undermine incipient, fragile participative
   systems. The study of participation would benefit from closer attention
   to how social, economic, and political structures constrain or
   facilitate such systems, and more extensive links among the various
   literatures on the subject.},

Abstract = {This study attempts to assess work-related values in Singapore and how
   these work values may differ from those of another nationality. The aim
   of this study is to replicate Hofstede's model in the Singapore
   managerial context. A comparison is made between Singaporean Chinese
   managers and Japanese managers in Singapore. Hofstede's four value
   dimensions of Individualism, Power Distance, Uncertainty Avoidance and
   Masculinity are used. The mean Power Distance and Masculinity scores of
   Singaporean Chinese managers and Japanese managers are found to be
   different from the samples in Hofstede's study. These differences in
   work values indicate that interpretations of Hofstede's cultural
   constructs cannot be made without modifying or redefining the constructs
   in terms that are relevant to the cultural context. This finding is
   supported by the differences in factors that make up the Individualism
   and Masculinity value dimensions of Singaporean Chinese and Japanese
   managers. The differences in work values between are explained by
   cultural and national factors. The impact of these work values on work
   behavior is discussed with respect to implications on motivation,
   leadership, employment stability, and orientation toward work goals.},

Abstract = {This study examines participatory management systems and productivity in
   similar plants located in five different countries. Likert's System 4
   theory was used as a tool to measure the nature and extent of
   participation. All five plants were engaged in identical operations that
   were designed and implemented by its U.S.-based owner. Each of the
   plants, however, was under the direction of host nationals. Data
   demonstrated that the degree of participation differed widely between
   the Italian, Mexican, Spanish, American, and English plants. It appears
   that the management systems in each of the plants reflects the
   expectations of the society and the local workforce. The data also
   revealed significant differences in the levels of productivity. While
   the most productive plants had the lowest levels of participation, the
   relationship between productivity and participation was not
   statistically significant across the five plants. The study concludes
   that management systems which are culturally congruent can produce equal
   levels of productivity independent of whether managers are empowered, or
   operate under centralized, autocratic control.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT STUDIES},
Year = {1995},
Volume = {32},
Number = {5},
Pages = {637-654},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Equal pay for work of equal value has come to be almost inextricably
   associated with the application of job evaluation. Current trends
   towards performance-related pay systems pose a potential threat to the
   pursuit of greater gender pay equality as discretion in pay
   determination increases and there is no clear relationship between
   earnings and job grade. This paper examines the basis for this view
   drawing upon the now widespread literature and research into
   performance-related pay. The argument is made that the problem for
   gender equality lies both in the nature of the payment system and in the
   context in which it is being applied, including the changes in the
   nature of employment relationships that are accompanying these
   developments. While some women may benefit, overall the moves towards a
   widening income dispersion and the increased importance of management
   discretion and appraisal are likely to disadvantage women. However, the
   individualization of pay is likely to lead to further fragmentation of
   the interests of women, reducing the likelihood of collective
   resistance. Opportunities to monitor pay trends will also decrease as
   the spread of performance-related pay reduces the transparency of the
   labour market.},

Abstract = {In order to assess the generality of a theory of collective induction
   that has previously been supported for face-to-face interaction
   (Laughlin and Hollingshead, Organizational Behavior and Human Decision
   Processes, 1995), three experiments compared face-to-face and
   computer-mediated interaction for four-person groups for three
   successive rule induction problems. The predictions of the theory fit
   the obtained probabilities of group hypotheses for distributions of
   member hypotheses better than four other plausible models for both
   face-to-face and computer-mediated groups, over four levels of potential
   information, and for group versus member choice of evidence. There were
   comparable numbers of correct hypotheses for face-to-face and
   computer-mediated interaction, increasing correct hypotheses with
   increasing potential information, and comparable numbers of correct
   hypotheses for group versus member choice of evidence. The three
   experiments indicate the generality of the theory for both traditional
   face-to-face interaction and computer-mediated interaction, four levels
   of potential information, and group versus member choice of information.
   The comparisons of face-to-face and computer-mediated interaction extend
   the emphasis on social communication processes on decision and idea
   generation tasks of previous research to social combination processes in
   the acquisition and processing of new information in cooperative rule

Abstract = {In this paper we argue that market boundaries are socially constructed

   underlying rivalry among Scottish knitwear producers. The data suggest
   that a six-category model of organizational forms best describes the
   common sense of competition in the industry and that an ensemble of
   attributes involving size, technology, product style, and geographic
   location forms the foundation for this ordering. The results also show
   how this industry model is reproduced within the rivalry network
   structuring imperfect competition in the industry.},

   attempts to achieve the same goal, behavioral or organizational change
   that reduces pollution and/or provides environmental protection, each
   strategy is distinct in its means. We discuss how command-and-control
   capitalizes on fear, market-based incentives capitalize on greed, and
   voluntarism on one's sense of social responsibility. We discuss the
   implications of choosing each of these policy alternatives by drawing on
   the insights of `'social dilemmas'' research that analyzes situations in
   which the individual and the collective good are in conflict.},

   occupational organization in its contemporary socioeconomic and

   and Glasgow in 1853 was an organizational response to the activities of
   a powerful group of London merchants whose demands for law reform were
   founded on the dominant economic philosophy of mid-Victorian Britain and
   whose proposals threatened the interests of accountants in Scotland.
   Further, a linkage between the dynamics of professional organization in

Abstract = {An allocation is commonly regarded as `'fair'' if the ratio of outcome
   of two persons equals the ratio of their respective inputs. In
   allocation of pay, however, a subtractive model with sigmoidal-shaped
   judgment function has recently been reported. The present research
   further tested the plausibility of the subtractive model in allocations
   of pay and workload. Subjects decided either pay (N = 17) or workload (N
   = 17) for Person A using three pieces of information-the pay of B and
   the input of A and B or the workload of B and the pay of A and B. As
   hypothesized, factorial plots of the input (or pay) of Persons A and B
   across the low, moderate, and high levels of pay (or workload) of Person
   B yielded the diverging, slanted barrel, and converging patterns,
   respectively. Monotonic transformations of the data rescaled
   nonparallelism to perfect parallelism. The judgment function had a
   sigmoidal shape characterized by `'door'' and `'ceiling'' effects. These
   results support the subtractive model but question the ratio model of
   `'fair'' allocations. (C) 1995 Academic Press, Inc.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this study was to explore the degree to which concepts

   occurrence of violent marriage (VM) during the study year.  As in
   comparable North American research, martial violence was associated with
   economic hardship, with lack of collectiveness in the dyad, and with the
   conflict solving tactics employed by both spouses.  VM women held
   different attitudes toward husband control and martial violence, and
   were emotionally dependent on their husbands.  Discriminant analysis
   successfully classified 90\% of the cases (67\% of VM).  The findings
   can be interpreted in terms of the battered women syndrome as well as in
   terms of a struggle for power within the family.  The data strongly
   suggest that these may be two distinct patterns of marital violence.},

Title = {FROM MODERN TO POSTMODERN ORGANIZATIONAL ANALYSIS},
Journal = {ORGANIZATION STUDIES},
Year = {1995},
Volume = {16},
Number = {4},
Pages = {579-604},
Abstract = {The terms `modern' and `postmodern' have become common currency in
   intellectual debates within organization studies. The postmodern is
   variously interpreted as an `epoch', a `perspective', or a new
   `paradigm' of thought. In this paper the author argues that what
   distinguishes the postmodern from the modern is a `style of thinking'
   which eschews the uncritical use of common organizational terms such as
   `organizations', `individuals', `environment', `structure', and
   `culture', etc. These terms refer to the existence of social entities
   and attributes within a modernist problematic. This is because a
   modernist thought style relies on a `strong' ontology (the study of the
   nature and essence of things) of being which privileges thinking in
   terms of discrete phenomenal `states', static `attributes' and
   sequential `events'. Postmodern thinking, on the other hand, privileges
   a `weak' ontology of becoming which emphasizes a transient, ephemeral
   and emergent reality. From this thought style, reality is deemed to be
   continuously in flux and transformation and hence unrepresentable in any
   static sense. Debates about modernism and postmodernism which do not
   address this ontological distinction miss critical insights which
   postmodernism brings to the study of organization. Adopting a postmodern
   mode of thinking implies radical consequences for rethinking
   organization studies. Instead of the traditional emphasis on
   organizations, organizational forms and organizational attributes, what
   is accentuated is the importance of examining local assemblages of
   `organizings' which collectively make up social reality. A postmodern
   style of thought, therefore, brings with it a different set of
   ontological commitments, intellectual priorities and theoretical
   preoccupations to bear on the study of organization.},

Abstract = {Collective induction is the cooperative search for descriptive,
   predictive, and explanatory generalizations, rules, and principles.  We
   present a social combination theory of collective induction in the form
   of eight postulates.  The theory proposes that collective induction
   entails an orderly social combination process of resolution of
   disagreement among group members by voting, turntaking, demonstration,
   and formation of emergent hypotheses, rather than any of these four
   processes alone.  Three predictions were derived from the theory and
   supported for four-person groups on rule induction problems.  First, the
   theory predicted the obtained group hypotheses better than each of the
   other four processes alone.  Second, if a correct hypothesis was
   proposed by at least one group member on some trial there was a high
   probability (.82) of a correct final group hypothesis.  Third, if a
   correct hypothesis was not proposed by at least one group member on some
   trial there was a very high probability (.98) of an incorrect final
   group hypothesis. Discussion considers support for the theory, cognition
   as collaboration, and boundary conditions.  (C) 1995 Academic Press,

Abstract = {A social dilemma is a situation in which members of a group are faced
   with a conflict between maximizing personal interests and maximizing
   collective interests.  Communication among the members of a group has
   been shown to enhance cooperation (maximize groups interests); it was
   hypothesized that if members are allowed to make a pledge prior to their
   actual decision, they can communicate their intentions and hence
   increase the cooperation rate.  Two experiments were conducted in which
   several types of pledge conditions were contrasted with a `'no-pledge''
   (control) condition.  As hypothesized, the results indicate that a
   pledge enhanced cooperation.  However, the degree of commitment required
   in the pledge differentially affected the cooperation rate.  The results
   are interpreted in terms of a two-stage dilemma in which members can
   coordinate their expectations only if some degree of commitment is
   required in their pledge.  (C) 1994 Academic Press, Inc.},

Abstract = {Milton Friedman has argued that corporations have no responsibility to
   society beyond that of obeying the law and maximizing profits for
   shareholders. Individuals may have social responsibilities according to
   Friedman, but not corporations.
   When executives make contributions to address social problems in the
   name of the corporation, they are doing so with other people's
   (shareholders') money. The responsibility of corporate executives is a
   fiduciary one, to serve as an agent for the corporation's shareholders,
   and to uphold shareholders' trust, which requires executives to maximize
   the return to their shareholders, who can then, if they choose,
   contribute their own money to worthy causes.
   Of course, shareholders face the decision problems inherent in the
   classic `'prisoners' dilemma,'' where the choices that are collectively
   sensible are individually unreasonable. Given their dilemma,
   shareholders should not expect to be able to control executives
   sufficiently to make them perfect agents, dutifully seeking to maximize
   shareholder profits in every decision. But, at least as an ideal,
   Friedman would argue that executives should serve as perfect agents and
   should not reduce corporate profits by contributing to social causes.
   Friedman's critics have focused on the assumptions implicit in
   Friedman's conceptual framework, one of the more important of which is
   that executives have no other fiduciary responsibility other that the
   one they have with their shareholders.
   The purpose of this paper is to stay within Friedman's conceptual
   framework and, at the same time, the question Friedman's view on the
   social responsibility of business, even as an ideal. We do this by
   focusing directly on how managers will behave, given their status as
   agents and the extant costs shareholders must incur to closely monitor
   their executives, and then drawing on important conceptual insights
   regarding the inefficient provision of community or public goods, best
   articulated by Friedman himself.
   Friedman has argued that contributions to many social problems generate
   positive neighborhood, or spillover, effects. Because of these positive
   spillovers, a prisoners' dilemma exists with collective rationality
   calling for everyone to contribute to the solution of a social problem,
   but with it being irrational from the perspective of each individual to
   make such a contribution. Once this prisoners' dilemma is recognized,
   the possibility exists that all shareholders would be worse off if the
   shareholders of each corporation had the ability to exert perfect
   control over their corporate agents, thereby preventing them from
   violating Friedman's prescription for social responsibility by making
   corporate contributions in excess of profit maximizing levels.},

Abstract = {Because an organization's existence is a prerequisite for its
   accomplishments, one would expect that researchers would be intensely
   interested in those factors which could lessen the likelihood of
   organizational decline and failure. Yet, until recently little research
   appeared regarding this topic and very little of it focused on the
   effectiveness of strategy on the likelihood of corporate bankruptcy.
   This research will review some of the strategy variables and investigate
   avenues that are most likely to hold the greatest potential for altering
   a firm's likelihood of failure. An exploratory model was developed to
   study the effects of corporate and business level strategies, as well as
   cooperative interorganizational and financial strategies. A consistent,
   significant positive relationship was discovered between survival and a
   firm's number of interorganizational linkages in the form of director
   interlocks. A consistent, significant negative relationship was
   discovered between survival and a firm's financial leverage. It was also
   discovered that as failing firms move closer toward bankruptcy they
   exhibit a degree of isomorphism with their surviving counterparts
   regarding certain interorganizational arrangements. That such changes in
   the interorganizational arrangements of failing companies do little to
   help save them suggests that turnaround efforts must start early in a
   firm's decline if it is to overcome the substantial amount of
   organizational inertia present in the corporation.},

Abstract = {Organizational routines-multi-actor, interlocking,
   reciprocally-triggered sequences of actions-are a major source of the
   reliability and speed of organizational performance.  Without routines,
   organizations would lose efficiency as structures for collective action.
   But these frequently repeated action sequences can also occasionally
   give rise to serious suboptimality, hampering performance when they are
   automatically transferred onto inappropriate situations.
   While the knowledgeable design and redesign of routines presents a
   likely lever for those wishing to enhance organizational performance,
   the lever remains difficult to grasp because routines are hard to
   observe, analyze, and describe.  This paper argues that new work in
   psychology on `'procedural'' memory may help explain how routines arise,
   stabilize and change.  Procedural memory has close links to notions of
   individual skill and habit.  It is memory for how things are done that
   is relatively automatic and inarticulate, and it encompasses both
   cognitive and motor activities.
   We report an experiment in which paired subjects developed interlocked
   task performance patterns that display the chief characteristics of
   organizational routines.  We show evidence from their behavior
   supporting the claim that individuals store their components of
   organizational routines in procedural memory.  If routines are stored as
   distributed procedural memories, this may be the source of distinctive
   properties reported by observers of organizational routines.  The paper
   concludes with implications for both research and practice.},

Abstract = {Much of individuals' lives are spent working in groups, but not all
   individuals necessarily react to groups in the same way. Based upon
   previous research, we examined the construct of dispositional group
   loyalty as a predictor of willingness to contribute to organizational
   success. Individuals high in dispositional group loyalty were thought to
   be more likely to exert effort on behalf of their ingroups than
   individuals low in dispositional group loyalty. Furthermore, this effect
   should only be manifested in certain situations. In particular,
   individuals with high group loyalty should perform better when their
   group is being compared to another than when intergroup comparison is
   lacking. Three experimental studies were done to test this possibility.
   In each case, the prediction outlined above was supported. A fourth
   correlational study provided evidence from outside of the laboratory
   that dispositional group loyalty predicts involvement in group-based
   organizational activities, positiveness of attitudes toward
   organizations, and inclination to perform behaviors for the benefit of
   one's organization. Theoretical and applied implications are discussed.

Title = {THREATS AND OPPORTUNITIES FACED BY PRIVATE BUSINESSES IN CHINA},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BUSINESS VENTURING},
Year = {1994},
Volume = {9},

Abstract = {This article presents a comprehensive analysis of the environment
   experienced by private businesses in China through examining their
   relationships with the major stakeholders-namely government, supplier,
   employee, customer, and competitor.
   Since the announcement of the economic reform in 1978, substantial
   political and economic power has been delegated from the central
   government to the regions.  Endowed with this power, local governments
   have crucial influence on the size of the private sector within their
   jurisdiction.  Being outside the state allocation plan, private firms
   have less access to raw materials and credit.  In the volatile political
   climate of China, they are vulnerable to attack during political
   campaigns.  Maintaining a cordial relationship with local cadres,
   through paying bribes and various charges, is thus a prerequisite for
   survival.  Having solicited political backing, a private entrepreneur
   can not only run his business more smoothly, but also may be more
   tolerated in his illegal activities such as tax evasion, profiteering,
   and selling banned products.  In short, the whole situation can be
   described as a collusion of local governments and private businesses at
   the expense of the central government's interest.
   Under the economic reform, the distribution system has become less rigid
   than before.  It is easier for private firms to secure supplies, whether
   raw materials or manufactured goods.  Labor input is also not a problem
   for most private firms which are small in size and employ mainly
   unskilled workers.  However, large private enterprises have to compete
   with state, collective, and foreign enterprises for managerial staff who
   are in short supply.
   There have been marked changes in the consumption pattern since the
   early 1980s.  People spend less on staple foods and more on non-staple
   foods, consumer goods, and services.  Moreover, China is experiencing a
   consumption boom.  Altogether this offers great opportunities to the
   private sector, which has been expanding its share of industrial output
   and retail sales very fast.  On the other hand, competition is becoming
   much keener.  State enterprises are improving their efficiency and giant
   multinational corporations are rushing in.  As there are few entry
   barriers, private entrepreneurs are also competing fiercely among
   themselves.
   The ideological contradiction of having labor exploitation by private
   entrepreneurs in a socialist country has prevented the Chinese
   government from actively encouraging private business.  The private
   sector has been assigned a supplementary role in the dominant public
   economy.  This status has led to discrimination against private firms in
   obtaining factor inputs, accounting partly for their vulnerability to
   bureaucratic harassment by local cadres.  This will continue to hamper
   private business development.  It is concluded that ideological and
   political reforms, in addition to the economic reform, are required for
   providing a more conducive environment for private businesses.  The
   Chinese experience of liberalizing the private sector offers useful
   insights to governments of other developing countries.},

Abstract = {Faced with turbulent national and international environments, entire
   U.S. industries-most notably steel and automobiles-have revealed a
   distinct propensity to overlook radically new types of competitors,
   cling to traditional technologies, and remain mired in similar, yet
   outdated, strategic postures. In this article, we ascribe the adaptive
   failures of entire industries not only to the microcultures of single
   organizations, but also to what we term interorganizational
   `'macrocultures''-relatively idiosyncratic beliefs that are shared by
   managers across organizations. More specifically, we propose that
   value-added networks linking organizations into collectivities both
   induce and reflect the existence and persistence of more or less
   homogeneous macrocultures. In turn, homogeneous macrocultures (a)
   increase the level of inertia these organizations experience, (b)
   influence the inventiveness of organizations and the diffusion of
   innovations among them, and (c) increase the similarity of member
   organizations' strategic profiles.},

Abstract = {Lacking an appropriate theoretical framework, economists and economic
   historians have paid little attention to the relations between culture
   and institutional structure. This limits the ability to address a
   question that seems to be at the heart of development failures: Why do
   societies fail to adopt the institutional structure of more economically
   successful ones? This paper integrates game-theoretical and sociological
   concepts to conduct a comparative historical analysis of the relations
   between culture and institutional structure. It examines cultural
   factors that have led two premodern societies-one from the Muslim world
   and the other from the Latin world-to evolve along distinct trajectories
   of institutional structure. It indicates the theoretical importance of
   culture in determining institutional structures, in leading to their
   path dependence, and in forestalling successful intersociety adoption of
   institutions. Since the distinct institutional structures found in the
   late medieval period resemble those differentiating contemporary
   developing and developed economics, the paper suggests the historical
   importance of distinct cultures in economic development.},

Journal = {HUMAN RELATIONS},
Year = {1994},
Volume = {47},
Number = {10},
Pages = {1201-1231},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Until recently, studies of the impact of bureaucratic employment on
   professionals drew heavily on structural models, such as the theories of
   proletarianization and of professional stratification.  In contrast,
   this paper develops a processual approach to professional control.  This
   approach views control as resulting from struggles by occupational
   groups for institutional recognition and from struggles and negotiations
   within and between occupations.  The structural and processual
   approaches are applied to the explanation of union activity-an
   increasingly prominent form of collective action among employed
   professionals.  Unionization and union militancy are examined among
   Israeli physicians, who have a long history of bureaucratic employment. 
   Although they are helpful, neither the proletarianization nor the
   stratification theories adequately account for the overall pattern of
   medical unionization or for individual and subgroup involvement in a
   lengthy physicians' strike.  The processual approach points to several
   forces that help explain unionization and variations in strike
   involvement.  These forces include institutional and contextual
   conditions, power differences between professional-subgroups,
   interactions among multiple actors in and around the professions, and
   the professionals' subjective interpretations and feelings.  Although
   the processual approach is a loose perspective, rather than a tight-knit
   theory, it offers a better guide than the structural theories to
   investigating both professional-bureaucratic relations and collective
   actions aimed at enhancing professional control.},

Abstract = {The author proves an equivalence between large games with effective
   small groups of players and games generated by markets. Small groups are
   effective if all or almost all gains to collective activities can be
   achieved by groups bounded in size. A market is an exchange economy
   where all participants have concave, quasi-linear payoff functions. The
   market approximating a game is socially homogeneous-all participants
   have the same monotonic nondecreasing, and 1-homogeneous payoff
   function. Our results imply that any market (more generally, any economy
   with effective small groups) can be approximated by a socially
   homogeneous market.},

Title = {CONSENSUS, DIVERSITY, AND LEARNING IN ORGANIZATIONS},
Journal = {ORGANIZATION SCIENCE},
Year = {1994},
Volume = {5},
Number = {3},
Pages = {403-420},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Organizational learning, like individual learning, involves the
   development of new and diverse interpretations of events and situations.
   Unlike individual learning, however, collective learning also involves
   developing enough consensus around those diverse interpretations for
   organized action to result. Traditional measures of organizational
   consensus are unable to capture the multiplex nature of collective
   agreement that encompasses both unity and diversity. Traditional wisdom
   thus suggests that to achieve unity in groups, one must sacrifice
   diversity.
   This study breaks the notion of consensus into two component parts:
   consensus around interpretations embedded in the content and in the
   framing of communications. Communicated content consists of the labels
   people use to convey their `'pictures'' of reality, e.g., pictures of
   issues as threats or as opportunities. The framing of communications
   refers to the form people use to construct a picture, regardless of its
   content, e.g., rigid or flexible perceptions of an issue. People may
   hold very different pictures of reality and still agree on the way they
   frame them. It is thus possible for groups to simultaneously agree and
   disagree, an essential component of collective learning.
   Simultaneous agreement and disagreement is especially important in
   corporate innovative efforts. Successful corporate innovation requires
   that decision makers develop a collective understanding that
   incorporates the new and the different. This paper describes the
   changing pictures and frames communicated in a new-venture development
   process in a large financial institution over a two-year period. Several
   linguistic analyses show how the venture team members developed unified
   ways of framing their arguments, while at the same time maintaining
   diversity through differences in the content of team members'
   interpretations. The results reveal one way that organizations manage to
   combine the unity and diversity needed for collective learning. The
   managerial implications present a challenge for anyone wishing to
   promote learning as a community: managers must actively encourage the
   development of different and conflicting views of what is thought to be
   true, while striving for a shared framing of the issues that is broad
   enough to encompass those differences.},

Title = {REASONING IN THE EXECUTIVE SUITE - THE INFLUENCE OF ROLE
   EXPERIENCE-BASED EXPERTISE ON DECISION-PROCESSES OF CORPORATE-EXECUTIVES},
Journal = {ORGANIZATION SCIENCE},
Year = {1994},
Volume = {5},
Number = {3},
Pages = {438-455},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {This study investigates the effect of high level executives'
   professional experience, expertise, and role in a specific functional
   area such as finance or corporate development on their reasoning
   processes when making managerial decisions. Chief Financial Officers
   (CFOs) and Vice-Presidents of Corporate Development (VPs) in the
   diversified foods industry were tape recorded as they thought aloud
   while evaluating four restaurant chains which were candidates for
   corporate acquisition. The experiment was designed so that these four
   acquisition candidates varied with respect to key financial and
   profitability data and such measures of a firm's strategic business
   position as product concept, markets, distribution channels, labor
   relations, and managerial expertise and loyalty. The attributes of
   financial performance and strategic position embedded in the
   descriptions of candidate firms were validated by an expert panel. The
   executives also provided rating-scale evaluations of the strategic,
   financial, and overall desirability of the four candidate firms.
   The taped thought processes (verbal protocols) were analyzed to
   determine whether CFOs and VPs differed when evaluating the overall
   desirability of the acquisition candidates in their use of such lines of
   reasoning as assessments of the candidate's competitive environment,
   financial strength, management, operations, and the potential financial,
   managerial, and operational synergies offered by the proposed
   acquisition. The probability of generating these assessments during the
   evaluation process did not appear to be related to expertise based on
   experience or organizational role.
   When the protocols were analyzed with respect to specific business
   issues identified by CFOs and VPs when evaluating acquisition
   candidates, however, there was a role/experience effect. Overall ratings
   of candidate-firm desirability were straightforward functions of the
   executive's ratings of the candidate's strategic position and financial
   performance. On average, VPs tended to be more optimistic in their
   evaluations than CFOs.
   There is modest statistical evidence that VPs and CFOs differ in the
   emphasis they place on strategic and financial ratings in evaluating a
   candidate's overall promise. VPs tend to take a balanced view in forming
   their overall ratings, whereas CFOs place the predominant weight on
   financial matters.
   The similarity in lines of reasoning used by CFOs and VPs presents
   evidence of shared expertise at the corporate level. The difference in
   the attention that CFOs and VPs place on specific business issues
   suggests that collectively these different perspectives constitute an
   adaptive survival mechanism which evolves in successful organizations.
   The mechanism complements the shared expertise and protects
   organizations from making flawed strategic decisions. Analyzing these
   role/experience-based differences has value in developing an
   understanding of how organizations do and should integrate
   recommendations from executive officers of various functional areas.},

Year = {1994},
Volume = {31},
Number = {4},
Pages = {553-568},

Abstract = {Virtually all prior research on small and medium sized enterprise (SME)
   management has focused on owner managers. This article, however,
   empirically examines the determinants of managerial remuneration for a
   sample of 97 UK SME non-owning managerial employees. The empirical
   analysis, based upon data obtained from interviews with middle (i.e.
   non-director level) managers and the published financial records of
   their employing firms lodged at Companies House, first examines the
   influence of firm size and performance and then augments the empirical
   model to include pay composition, industrial sector, external labour
   market and human capital variables.
   The empirical results indicate that the average profitability of the
   employing firms is not a significant determinant of managerial
   remuneration. However, composition of pay appears to have a significant
   effect upon total remuneration since, even after controlling for other
   influences, managers in receipt of annual bonuses and/or profit-sharing
   bonuses are estimated to earn an additional 6,600 Pound. The managers'
   age and qualifications, and the asset size, industry and location of
   their employing firms are also significant factors and collectively are
   able to explain a large proportion of the cross-sectional variance in
   remuneration. Though there is a lack of previous empirical research on
   SME managerial pay, these results are broadly consistent with the
   expectations derived from the extant theoretical and empirical
   literatures on managerial remuneration.},

Abstract = {This paper examines the relation between the market reaction to primary

   of the issuing firm's growth opportunities. While the sample offerings
   display a positive relation between announcement period prediction
   errors and several ex ante measures of growth opportunities, this
   relation is not monotonic and appears to be driven by a small subset of
   younger, higher growth firms, whose announcement effects are
   insignificantly different from zero. For the remainder of the sample
   firms, there is no relation between the estimated profitability of new
   investment and the market reaction to announced equity offerings.
   Moreover, announcement effects are nonpositive regardless of how
   profitable investment opportunities are expected to be. These findings
   collectively suggest that investment opportunities play, at best, a
   minor role in explaining the cross-sectional distribution of equity
   offering announcement effects.},

   these changes more difficult than they had originally imagined. Few

Abstract = {This paper examines the theoretical and empirical relationship of
   training and individualism-collectivism to self-efficacy (a person's
   estimate of his or her ability to perform a task) and performance in
   studies of managers from Hong Kong, the People's Republic of China, and
   the United States. A laboratory experiment and a six-month field
   experiment were used to test hypotheses predicting that for
   individualists, self-focused training would have a stronger impact on
   self-efficacy and performance than would group-focused training and, for
   collectivists, group-focused training would have a stronger impact on
   self-efficacy and performance than would individual-focused training.
   The results show consistent support for the hypotheses at both a
   cultural and an individual level of analysis. A general model of
   self-efficacy and culture in an organizational environment is discussed.},

Journal = {ORGANIZATION STUDIES},
Year = {1994},
Volume = {15},
Number = {1},
Pages = {47-79},
Abstract = {Interest in organizations first appeared between World War I and World
   War II, with the American studies led by Mayo. Since then, interest has
   grown and spread to most industrialized countries. In the sixties, in
   Anglo-Saxon countries and especially in the United States where research
   was first conducted, organizational analysis developed into an
   independent field of investigation.
   Economic growth, the proliferation and expansion of organizations and a
   marked tendency `to rationalize the world' have compelled an increasing
   number of Western researchers to question the social dynamics of
   organized groups. This interest has been reinforced over the past few
   years by the failure of collectivist solutions, the growing popularity
   of private enterprise as well as by the type of management thinking that
   presently predominates in Western countries, but more generally by the
   prevalence of thinking about the world in organizational terms. Given
   this general tendency, which is observable in most industrialized
   countries, this paper aims to demonstrate how Francophone analysis has
   evolved and remains distinct to this day from Anglophone - and more
   particularly from the American mainstream - analysis.},

Abstract = {The culture of the national environment in which an organization

   differences have been found. Among other things, they affect the
   implicit models in people's minds of what the act of organizing means.
   Among the pioneers in management science around 1900, differences along
   these dimensions are already noticeable. A fifth dimension was added
   when the research instrument used was designed exclusively by Chinese
   scholars, and it provides a cultural explanation for the economic
   success of East Asian countries in the past quarter century. At the same
   time, it highlights the influence of the culture of the management
   scientist on the research questions and the resulting theories.},

Abstract = {This study examined social psychological factors associated with
   willingness to participate in collective action. These factors were
   group identification, collectivist orientation, outgroup stereotyping,
   perceived intergroup conflict, egoistic and collective relative
   deprivation, and political efficacy. Three hundred and fifty members of
   a trade union completed questionnaires where items measured these
   factors along with their prospective participation in a range of union
   activities. Regression analyses indicated that the mast significant
   correlate of participation was the strength of the respondent's sense of
   group identification. Other significant correlates were collectivist
   orientation and the degree to which the outgroup (management) was
   perceived in a stereotypical fashion. Further analyses were undertaken
   to examine the possible moderating effect of group identification on the
   relationships between independent and dependent variables. These
   indicated a broadly similar pattern of results for both strong and weak
   group identifiers though collective relative deprivation appeared to be
   somewhat more important for strong identifiers and political efficacy
   somewhat more important for weak identifiers. These findings are
   discussed in the context of research into social identity and collective
   action in other settings.},

Abstract = {Recent developments in the theory of knowing and doing contrast with
   conventional rational-cognitive assumptions about management and
   organization. This, and the emphasis that is currently being placed on
   the importance of esoteric knowledge for business success, suggests that
   a review of the relationship between knowledge, organization and
   management is timely. Activity theory offers a way of synthesizing and
   developing relevant notions. The approach has its origins in Russian
   psychology which endeavoured to avoid the dichotomies between thought
   and action and between individuals and society which have characterized
   Western theory. Activity theory examines the nature of practical
   activities, their social origins, and the nature of the `activity
   systems' within which people collaborate. Modifications to Engestrom's
   contemporary presentation of the approach are suggested, and a theory of
   organizations as activity systems is offered. The theory reframes
   management by modelling the recurrent and embedded nature of human
   activities, by revealing the tentative nature of knowledge and its
   action orientation, and by highlighting the opportunities for individual
   and collective development that engagement and dilemma can provide. The
   article concludes by reviewing implications for the management of
   knowledge work, organizational capabilities and organizational learning.},

Title = {The late nineteenth-century revolution in financial reporting:
   Accounting for the rise of investor or managerial capitalism?},
Journal = {ACCOUNTING ORGANIZATIONS AND SOCIETY},
Year = {1993},
Volume = {18},
Number = {7-8},
Pages = {646-690},
Month = {OCT-NOV},
Abstract = {Conventional accounting history explains the rise of modern financial
   reporting (MFR) in the U.K. in the late nineteenth century, the
   publication of independently audited, cost-based accrual accounts, as a
   response to the appearance of `'managerial capitalism'', the `'divorce''
   of ownership from control. It is almost universally accepted that MFR
   had no clear conceptual foundation and that management was able to
   manipulate published accounts in its own interests. Many historians
   assume the result was capital market inefficiency. A minority explicity
   assumes capital market efficiency, but also explains MFR as the
   consequence of management's pursuit of self-interest. However, it is
   argued here that MFR was clearly conceptualized, and the hypothesis is
   explored that its emergence and functioning in the late nineteenth
   century can more plausibly be explained as a response to the rise of
   ``investor capitalism{''}, the general socialization of capital which
   Marx predicted. From the 1880s shareholders began to passively hold
   well-diversified portfolios. Although ownership and control certainly
   became separated, their nature had fundamentally changed. For the first
   time in history on a large scale, industrial companies became
   collectively owned. It is argued that the rise of MFR can be explained
   as a response to the demand from investors collectively for help in
   managing the new social relationships which emerged between them and
   management, and between individual investors. It is concluded that when
   understood in the social, political and economic contexts in which it
   functioned, the evidence is consistent with the hypothesis that late
   nineteenth-century MFR provided investors with useful information, and
   that the capital market was efficient.},

Journal = {ACCOUNTING ORGANIZATIONS AND SOCIETY},
Year = {1993},
Volume = {18},
Number = {7-8},
Pages = {629-645},
Month = {OCT-NOV},
Abstract = {This paper calls firstly for genealogies of calculation, in contrast to
   traditional accounting history. The term genealogy conveys a focus on
   the outcomes of the past, rather than a quest for the origins of the
   present. It is intended to avoid an a priori limiting of the field of
   study to accounting as it currently exists, or to a particular
   accounting technique such as double-entry bookkeeping. And it entails an
   emphasis on the historical contingency of contemporary practices, a
   concern with the multiple and dispersed surfaces of emergence of
   disparate practices of economic calculation. Secondly, the paper
   emphasizes the discursive nature of calculation, the language and
   vocabularies in which a particular practice is articulated, the ideals
   attached to certain calculative technologies. Thirdly, the paper
   stresses the importance of attending to ensembles of practices and
   rationales that are assembled at various collective levels, rather than
   with isolated instances of this or that way of accounting. The
   delineation of the domain of traditional amounting history is
   illustrated by reference to three sets of issues: the links between
   double-entry bookkeeping std capitalism in the writings of Weber and
   Sombart; the links between bookkeeping practice and decision making in
   the writings of Yamey; and the quest for examples of ``early management
   accounting'' in the writings of those such as Edwads and Fleischman \&
   Parker. In contrast to such concerns of accounting history, four
   genealogies are presented: the promotion of discounted cash-flow
   techniques for investment decisions in the U.K. in the 1960s; the
   emergence of costs in the late eighteenth century; the accounting for
   value added event in Britain in the late 1970s; and the construction of
   standard costing in the early decades of the twentieth century.},

Abstract = {The understandings of individuality and sociability characteristic of
   modern liberal and sociological social theory are fatalistic about the
   potential for the creation of trust in economic relations. These
   understandings are reconsidered in light of the recent evolution of
   state-level industrial policy in the United States, focusing on the
   experience of the state of Pennsylvania where the state's efforts have
   shown early success in breaking down barriers of mistrust that block
   economic adjustment in the state's traditional manufacturing industries.
   Arguing that the sort of cooperation-in-the-making that characterizes
   the Pennsylvania case is ill-captured by mainstream theory, the paper
   proffers a notion of studied or vigilant trust based on the core
   conclusions of 20th century analytic philosophy as a way of squaring
   theory and stylized facts. Government-instigated discussion among key
   economic actors has the potential to spur reformulations of collective
   identities and common histories, resulting in the creation of new
   avenues of potentially trusting economic relations.},

Volume = {12},
Number = {9},
Pages = {727-739},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Drawing from the Boulding's (1956) framework for general systems theory,
   the need to employ richer paradigm in the study of organizations (Pondy
   and Mitroff, 1979) is reiterated. It is argued that a better
   understanding of organizational ethical behavior is contingent upon
   viewing organizations as symbol processing systems of shared language
   and meanings. Further, it is proposed that organizations, like
   individuals, develop into collectivities of shared cognitions and
   rationale, over a period of time. The study adapts Kohlberg's (1983)
   model of moral development to examine if organizations can be viewed as
   passing through different stages of moral development depending on the
   type of moral reasoning employed to explain their behaviors in the face
   of ethical crises. Several cases raising questions about the ethics of
   corporate behavior were researched. An instrument entitled Organization
   Response Analysis was constructed using statements made by various
   spokespersons representing five of these organizations. The instrument
   was administered to 246 graduate and undergraduate students of business
   (N = 246). Results indicated a great degree of concurrence among
   respondents of differing genders, levels of education and work
   experience in determining the stages of moral development of
   organizations. Limitations of the current study and implications for
   future research and practice are discussed.},

Abstract = {Strategic alliance building has proliferated in many industries in
   recent years. This research focuses on the dynamic aspects of the
   alliance building process that have been neglected in previous research.
   The study examines how organizations process information during
   strategic alliance building and how the effective management of
   uncertainty and equivocality is linked to alliance success. Analysis of
   qualitative and quantitative data from a multi-case study leads to a
   proposed model of information processing in strategic alliance building
   and research propositions. The research propositions suggest that
   strategic alliance success is facilitated or impeded by a number of
   factors including the selection of information-processing mechanisms,
   the management of alliance building momentum, political activity, and
   information-processing structure. These factors collectively form
   information-processing environments that are linked to the success or
   failure of the alliance. Successful alliance building efforts seem to
   require adaptive information-processing environments that alter
   information-processing mechanisms to match information-processing needs.},

Abstract = {This paper investigates the application of a new class of neighborhood
   search algorithms-cyclic transfers-to multivehicle routing and
   scheduling problems. These algorithms exploit the two-faceted decision
   structure inherent to this problem class: First, assigning demands to
   vehicles and, second, routing each vehicle through its assigned demand
   stops. We describe the application of cyclic transfers to vehicle
   routing and scheduling problems. Then we determine the worst-case
   performance of these algorithms for several classes of vehicle routing
   and scheduling problems. Next, we develop computationally efficient
   methods for finding negative cost cyclic transfers. Finally, we present
   computational results for three diverse vehicle routing and scheduling
   problems, which collectively incorporate a variety of constraint and
   objective function structures. Our results show that cyclic transfer
   methods are either comparable to or better than the best published
   heuristic algorithms for several complex and important vehicle routing
   and scheduling problems. Most importantly, they represent a novel
   approach to solution improvement which holds promise in many vehicle
   routing and scheduling problem domains.},

Abstract = {The concept of collective mind is developed to explain organizational

   interrelations of actions in a social system. Actors in the system
   construct their actions (contributions), understanding that the system
   consists of connected actions by themselves and others (representation),
   and interrelate their actions within the system (subordination). Ongoing
   variation in the heed with which individual contributions,
   representations, and subordinations are interrelated influences
   comprehension of unfolding events and the incidence of errors. As
   heedful interrelating and mindful comprehension increase, organizational
   errors decrease. Flight operations on aircraft carriers exemplify the
   constructs presented. Implications for organization theory and practice

Volume = {18},

Abstract = {The sheer number of organizations adopting an innovation can cause a
   bandwagon pressure. prompting other organizations to adopt this
   innovation. Institutional bandwagon pressures occur because nonadopters
   fear appearing different from many adopters. Competitive bandwagon
   pressures occur because nonadopters fear below-average performance if
   many competitors profit from adopting. Our mathematical model of
   bandwagons examines how organizational collectivities' characteristics
   determine (a) whether a bandwagon will occur. (b) how many organizations
   jump on it, and (c) how many retain the innovation it diffuses.
   Simulating the model suggests. first, that any technological,
   organizational, or strategic innovation with ambiguous returns can
   diffuse in a bandwagon manner; second. that minor differences in
   organizational collectivities can have major effects on bandwagons'
   occurrence, extent. and persistence; and third, that bandwagons can
   prompt most organizations in a collectivity to adopt an innovation, even
   when most of them expect that this adoption will yield negative returns.
   We suggest how to test our bandwagon model.},

Abstract = {Shirking, social loafing. and free riding are concepts that have guided

   which or the reasons why withholding effort occurs. Building on these
   ideas, this article applies Knoke's (1990) synthesized motivation model
   to PWE and suggests that rational, normative, and affective bonding
   incentives may play a role in employee PWE. Using the model, this
   article reconceptualizes and attempts to clarify past theory and

   and aesthetic (Habermas, J., The Theory of Communicative Action, Vol. 1,

   health-care industry and the empirical event focused upon is the
   introduction of a prospective payment system in 1983. The empirics raise
   some interesting suggestions for future research. It appears that
   accounting struggles as an instrumental technology but enables action by
   providing a way out of moral dilemmas and in so doing enacts substantive
   power effects upon human bodies, both individual and collective.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this article is twofold: first, to propose and test a
   model concerning how an organization's culture affects organizational
   performance; and second, to demonstrate the application of LISREL
   modeling methodology to estimate and test this model. Organizational
   culture is hypothesized to consist of three interrelated dimensions: a
   sociocultural system of the perceived functioning of the organization's
   strategies and practices, an organizational value system, and the
   collective beliefs of the individuals working within the organization.
   Organizational culture is operationalized by several latent variables:
   organizational structure and purpose, organizational values, task
   organization, climate, and individual values and beliefs. These
   variables, in turn, are hypothesized to affect organizational
   performance. Analysis of data from 392 respondents who participated in
   the study confirms the fit of the proposed model to the data. The model
   presented in the study represents an initial attempt to describe and
   evaluate the effects of various dimensions of organizational culture. It
   appears that the comparison of visible aspects of culture across and
   within organizations can provide useful information for guiding the
   directions of organizations. By investigating the variables defined in
   this study further, it may eventually be possible to explain why some
   organizations are not performing at desired levels of productivity. A
   methodological tool has also been presented in this article. It is clear
   that the application of structural equation modeling techniques can
   provide organizational scientists with powerful analytic tools for
   furthering theory testing and development. Structural modeling can be
   used to construct, estimate, and test a variety of models in
   organization science.},

Abstract = {Internal consistency of choice has been a central concept in demand
   theory, social choice theory, decision theory, behavioral economics, and
   related fields.  It is argued here that this idea is essentially
   confused, and there is no way of determining whether a choice function
   is consistent or not without referring to something external to choice
   behavior (such as objectives, values, or norms). We have to re-examine
   the robustness of the standard results in this light. The main formal
   result presented here is an extension of Arrow's General Possibility
   Theorem. This drops the need to impose any condition of internal
   consistency of social choice, or any internal notion of `'social
   rationality.''},

Title = {THE DEVELOPMENT OF AN INFRASTRUCTURE FOR ENTREPRENEURSHIP},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BUSINESS VENTURING},
Year = {1993},
Volume = {8},
Number = {3},
Pages = {211-230},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {This paper takes a macroperspective of entrepreneurship, and focuses on
   the issues and events involved in constructing an industrial
   infrastructure that facilitates and constrains entrepreneurship. This
   infrastructure includes: (1) institutional arrangements to legitimate,
   regulate, and standardize a new technology, (2) public resource
   endowments of basic scientific knowledge, financing mechanisms, and a
   pool of competent labor, as well as (3) proprietary R\&D, manufacturing,
   marketing, and distribution functions by private entrepreneurial firms
   to commercialize the innovation for profit. Although extensive research
   substantiates the importance of these infrastructure components, they
   have been treated as externalities to entrepreneurship. By incorporating
   these components within a single framework, one can systematically
   examine how various actors and functions interact to facilitate and
   constrain entrepreneurship.
   The paper makes three contributions to understanding entrepreneurship.
   First, I believe that the study of entrepreneurship is deficient if it
   focuses exclusively on the characteristics and behaviors of individual
   entrepreneurs, on the one hand, and if it treats the social, economic,
   and political factors influencing entrepreneurship as external
   demographic statistics, on the other hand. Popular folklore
   notwithstanding, the process of entrepreneurship is a collective
   achievement requiring key roles from numerous entrepreneurs in both the
   public and private sectors.
   Second, the paper examines how and why this infrastructure for
   entrepreneurship emerges. I argue that while this infrastructure
   facilitates and constrains individual entrepreneurs, it is the latter
   who construct and change the industrial infrastructure. This
   infrastructure does not emerge and change all at once by the actions of
   one or even a few key entrepreneurs. Instead, it emerges through the
   accretion of numerous institutional, resource, and proprietary events
   that co-produce each other over an extended period. Moreover, the very
   institutional arrangements and resource endowments created to facilitate
   industry emergence can become inertial forces that hinder subsequent
   technological development and adaptation by proprietary firms. This
   generative process has a dynamic history that is itself important to
   study systematically if one is to understand how novel forms of
   technologies, organizations, and institutions emerge.
   Finally, the paper emphasizes that the process of entrepreneurship is
   not limited to the for-profit sector; numerous entrepreneurial actors in
   the public and not-for-profit sectors play crucial roles. It motivates
   one to examine the different roles played by these actors, and how their
   joint contributions interact to develop and commercialize a new
   technology. This in turn makes it possible to understand how the risk,
   time, and cost to an individual entrepreneur are significantly
   influenced by developments in the overall infrastructure for
   entrepreneurship. It also explains why the entrepreneurs who run in
   packs will be more successful than those that go it alone to develop
   their innovations.},

   humorous television advertising from four national cultures: Korea,
   Germany, Thailand, and the United States. Findings indicate that
   humorous communications from such diverse national cultures share
   certain universal cognitive structures underlying the message. However,
   the specific content of humorous advertising is likely to be variable
   across national cultures along major normative dimensions such as
   collectivism-individualism.},

   the performance of individualists working alone, whereas collectivists'
   performance was lower in an individual or outgroup context than in an
   ingroup context. Perceptions of individual and group efficacy and

   approaches with `'soft'' behavioral variables. In proposing and

   a typology of theory-development approaches, and apply this framework

Volume = {8},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {This article presents the results of a study focused on the role of new
   business entrepreneurship in the Japanese economy. Particular attention
   is paid to the activities of various government agencies in relation to
   new business entrepreneurship and to the barriers to this activity in
   Japan. New business entrepreneurship was defined as the formation and
   rapid growth of a business enterprise through unique approaches to the
   firm's activities.
   In contrast to the American stereotype of Japan as an economy of a few
   large, interconnected firms, it is, in fact, characterized by small- and
   medium-sized enterprises. Over 99\% of all Japanese enterprises are
   categorized as small or medium and over 80\% of all employed Japanese
   are employed by such firms. However, very few of these firms are
   entrepreneurial in nature. The vast majority are small firms that are
   either subcontractors to a single larger firm or small retail,
   wholesale, or restaurant establishments.
   The start-up rate for all types of businesses in Japan has been
   declining for the past 10 to 15 years. More importantly, the rate of
   start-ups for independent firms, as opposed to firms started by a larger
   firm to serve primarily as a subcontractor, declined even more sharply.
   This indicates a significant weakness in Japan's otherwise strong
   economy.
   The low and declining rate of new business entrepreneurship in Japan is
   a function of structural, governmental, and cultural barriers.
   Structural barriers include an acute, long-term labor shortage, high
   financial start-up costs due in large part to high land prices, and a
   shortage of venture capital funding. Government barriers include `'red
   tape, `' financial and other support for small firms that is withdrawn
   as they enter rapid growth, and the persistent protection of inefficient
   industry structures. Cultural barriers involve Japan's strong
   group/collective orientation, the traditional career path in Japan,
   bounds on creativity, and the fact that entrepreneurship is not assigned
   a high social value.
   While the government provides an extensive, well-developed network of
   services for small- and medium-sized firms, these programs are not
   designed to facilitate rapid growth into the large firm phase. The
   Japanese experiences and programs offer useful insights for policy and
   tactics by other governments.},

Abstract = {Groups don't become teams because that is what someone calls them. Nor
   do teamwork values by themselves ensure team performance. So what is a
   team? How can managers know when the team option makes sense and what
   they can do to ensure team success? In this article, drawn from their
   recent book The Wisdom of Teams, McKinsey partners Jon Katzenbach and
   Douglas Smith answer these questions and outline the discipline that
   makes a real team.
   The essence of a team is shared commitment. Without it, groups perform
   as individuals; with it, they become a powerful unit of collective
   performance. The best teams invest a tremendous amount of time shaping a
   purpose that they can own. The best teams also translate their purpose
   into specific performance goals. And members of successful teams pitch
   in and become accountable with and to their teammates.
   The fundamental distinction between teams and other forms of working
   groups turns on performance. A working group relies on the individual
   contributions of its members for group performance. But a team strives
   for something greater than its members could achieve individually. In
   short, an effective team is always worth more than the gum of its parts.
   Katzenbach and Smith identify three basic types of teams: teams that
   recommend things - task forces or project groups; teams that make or do
   things - manufacturing, operations, or marketing groups; and teams that
   mn things - groups that oversee some significant functional activity.
   For managers, the key is knowing where in the organization real teams
   should be encouraged. Team potential exists anywhere hierarchy or
   organizational boundaries inhibit good performance. Considering the
   extra level that teams can achieve, the authors believe that teams will
   become the primary work unit in high-performance organizations.},

   processes and that of the other group members. It appears to be an
   effective aid in group decision making. Although it has been suggested
   as a potential feature of group decision support systems (GDSS), little
   research has examined its use and impact. This article investigates the
   effect of computer generated cognitive feedback in computer-supported
   group decision processes. It views group decision making as a
   combination of individual and collective activity. The article tests
   whether cognitive feedback can enhance control over the individual and
   collective decision making processes and can facilitate the process of
   convergence among group members. In a laboratory experiment with groups
   of three decision makers, 15 groups received online cognitive feedback
   and 15 groups did not. Users receiving cognitive feedback maintained a
   higher level of control over the decision-making process as their
   decision strategies converged. This research indicates that (1)
   developers should include cognitive feedback as an integral part of the
   GDSS at every level, and (2) they should design the human-computer
   interaction so there is an intuitive and effective transition across the
   components of feedback at all levels. Researchers should extend the
   concepts explored here to other models of conflict that deal with
   ill-structured decisions, as well as study the impact of cognitive
   feedback over time. Finally, researchers trying to enhance the
   capabilities of GDSS should continue examining how to take advantage of
   the differences between individual, interpersonal, and collective
   decision making.},

Abstract = {`'Participatory action research'' has been acclaimed for producing new
   knowledge as well as solutions to organizational and social problems.
   But the term has quite different meanings to different audiences: The
   `'Southern'' tradition is committed to community transformation through
   empowering disenfranchised groups; the `'Northern'' tradition is
   concerned with reforming organizations through problem-solving. This
   paper describes a series of collective reflections that brought together
   leaders of development agencies from Southern and Northern settings to
   consider the roles of nongovernmental development organizations (NGOs)
   in promoting sustainable development. The results of these reflections,
   in terms of new knowledge and new action strategies, are illustrated.
   Critical processes for such collective reflection, including the
   management of value and ideological differences, the definition of
   participation, and the organization of joint inquiry are discussed. The
   paper also discusses the implications of such reflections for
   re-defining the social realities of key actors in the development drama,
   and so catalyzing major changes in development theory and action through
   relatively small interventions.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF BUSINESS VENTURING},
Year = {1993},
Volume = {8},
Number = {1},
Pages = {75-90},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {If innovation is to be pursued as a long-term strategic move for
   prosperity rather than a survival tactic in troublesome times, an
   alternative focus is needed. Energies should be redirected toward
   maintenance responsibilities involving the overall corporate system
   rather than limiting efforts to venture initiation activities. While
   previous studies have investigated correlates of corporate
   entrepreneurship and its subsequent effect on organizational
   performance, few researchers have demonstrated any viable means of
   maintaining internally developed ventures (Biggadike 1979; Jennings et
   al. 1990; Jennings and Young 1990; Zahra 1991).
   This research piece posits long-term maintenance of an innovative
   organization as a joint function of identifying and securing the loyally
   of innovative-minded individuals and building appropriate organizational
   factors (e.g., structural and reward system) to retain them. In order to
   address this objective, this study examines the relationship between a
   set of key individual and organizational factors and a set of outcome
   variables consisting of specific job attitudes (job satisfaction,
   organizational commitment) and propensity to leave the organization for
   two types of managers, autonomous venture managers (AVMs) and
   departmental managers (DMs).
   This study surveyed upper middle level managers in Fortune 500 companies
   in organizational positions where the scope of their positions appeared
   to include the potential for innovation or autonomous action. Managers
   were classified as autonomous venture managers (AVMs) or departmental
   managers (DMs) based on autonomy and independence in decision-making.
   Managers who were heads of autonomous business units (e.g., venture
   groups) were classified as AVMs while those who were wt heads of such
   units were classified as DMs.
   Separate regression equations were constructed relating the set of
   individual and organizational factors to each of the aforementioned
   outcome variables for A VMs and DMs. It was hypothesized that
   significantly different individual and organizational factors would
   emerge across the outcome variables such that a distinctive response
   pattern would be present for both types of managers. Regression analysis
   and Chow tests indicated that only the organizational commitment model
   was significantly different for AVMs and DMs. The job satisfaction and
   propensity to leave models were not significantly different for the AVMs
   and DMs. Consequently, the overriding finding suggests that separate
   reward and structural alternatives are not necessary or even desirable
   for the two groups of managers. Further, the individual characteristics
   for the AVMs and DMs were descriptive of both groups. The challenge for
   organizational management practices appears to be the careful
   construction and nurturing of an innovative organizational environment
   to create potential for creative activities. Explicit actions that
   management in large, established organizations may take to build
   effectively an innovative organizational environment include the
   following: 1 .Making available both formal and informal structural
   outlets for creative activities to all managers. This means actively
   building venture groups as well as allowing free time to pursue projects
   of one's own undertaking. 2 . Reinforcing the opportunity to engage in
   innovative activities for all managers via financial and non-financial
   rewards. 3 . Recruiting for corporate entrepreneuring positions within
   the organization. Collectively, the managers were found to be
   potentially creative, resourceful individuals interested in innovation.},

Abstract = {Various models or lenses have been used to predict and understand

   classes: (1) the unitary rational; (2) the organizational; (3) the

   from different assumptions about goal congruency and co-ordinative
   efficiency. The contextual view is especially highlighted, as it is a
   relatively new perspective, both organizationally and cognitively.
   A brief discussion is offered of disciplines and findings that either
   support or refute some of these models. Possible syntheses and
   reconciliations of the four views are explored, focusing on: (1)
   assumptional fit; (2) level of analysis; (3) cost of fashioning
   collective rationality- (4) information processing limits in
   organizational design; and (5) the role of adaptation lags and
   disequilibrium. The article concludes with a call for a meta-theory that

Title = {CULTURAL INFLUENCES ON NATIONAL RATES OF INNOVATION},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BUSINESS VENTURING},
Year = {1993},
Volume = {8},
Number = {1},
Pages = {59-73},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The purpose of this research was to examine the effect of the cultural
   values of individualism, power distance, uncertainty avoidance, and
   masculinity on national rates of innovation in 33 countries in 1975 and
   1980. The study found that rates of innovation are most closely
   associated with the cultural value of uncertainty acceptance, but that
   lack of power distance and individualism also are related to high rates
   of innovation. This research suggests that nations may differ in their
   rates of innovation because of the cultural values of their citizens.
   These findings have important implications for managers and
   policy-makers. First, culture matters. Countries may not be able to
   increase their rates of innovation simply by increasing the amount of
   money spent on research and development or industrial infrastructure.
   They also may need to change the values of their citizens to those that
   encourage innovative activity. This concept, in turn, suggests that
   national rates of innovation are driven by more fundamental forces than
   economic conditions, and that societal change may be necessary to make
   less innovative societies more innovative.
   Second, the values associated with high national rates of innovation are
   those that many scholars have long argued are important at the firm
   level. An acceptance of uncertainty appears to be necessary, probably
   because innovation requires a tolerance for risk and change.
   Individualism seems to be important, perhaps because of its association
   with autonomy, independence, and freedom. Lack of power distance appears
   important, perhaps reflecting the role that tolerance of change in the
   social order and distribution of power play in the innovation process.
   Third, the study indicates that the strength of the relationship between
   innovation and two cultural values-individualism and lack of power
   distance-were stronger in 1975 than in 1980, suggesting, perhaps, that
   these values are becoming less important in spurring the innovation
   process. This finding supports the anecdotal evidence that many
   collectivist and hierarchical Asian nations are becoming more
   innovative.
   Fourth, this study shows that per capita income is a more important
   economic variable than industrial structure in determining national
   rates of innovation. This finding confirms previous work that has shown
   that as nations become wealthier, they become more innovative. The
   reason may be that wealthier countries have more demand for innovations,
   both because innovations are often labor-saving, and because wealthier
   nations have greater demand for new and differentiated consumer goods.},

Abstract = {The emergence of a British ethnic minority business class over the past
   decade promises much for the future of black people, but may deliver
   very little in terms of material improvement. Like its U.S. counterpart,
   which grew in the aftermath of the 1960's disorders, the British Black
   bourgeoisie is a product of post-riot developments. Many members of
   Britain's Afro-Caribbean and South Asian populations have lost faith in
   their power collectively to change society and are focusing on improving
   themselves as individuals. But a hitherto undetected form of racism
   threatens to undermine the efforts of the Black bourgeoisie to turn its
   particular successes into something more permanent for the black
   population generally. Business owners are forced to practice
   ``racism-by-proxy,{''} deliberately excluding blacks from their
   workforces.},

   a field survey of small manufacturing firms to test hypotheses
   concerning the relative frequencies of various collective strategies,
   the effects of environmental variables on collective activity, and the
   contribution of collective behavior to firm performance. Results
   indicate that agglomerate and organic collective strategies are the most
   frequently employed, and that munificent environments were positively
   associated with collective behavior and performance. Complex
   environments were negatively associated with collective strategy and no
   effect was found for volatile environments. The study also discusses
   methodological issues concerning the use of the COMPUSTAT database, and
   the usual practice of omitting cases with missing financial information.},

Journal = {ADMINISTRATIVE SCIENCE QUARTERLY},
Year = {1992},
Volume = {37},
Number = {4},
Pages = {527-548},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {This paper introduces the concept of the `'move'' as a unit of analysis
   in technical service interactions and uses it as the basis for a theory
   of organizational knowledge. Data from six months of participant
   observation at two software support hot lines were analyzed inductively
   to identify a core set of moves with which technical support specialists
   respond to customer calls. When a specialist cannot respond to a call
   alone, he or she has to get help from others or give the call away. The
   moves specialists use in these situations both reflect and enact the
   structure of the organization: transferring a call reflects division of
   labor, escalating a call reflects hierarchy, and so on. By allowing the
   technical support staff to accomplish work collectively they could not
   do individually, organizing moves embody the distinctively
   organizational aspect of the collective performance. If we adopt a
   pragmatic definition of knowledge as situated performance rather than
   abstract representation, then organizing moves are a logical foundation
   for a theory of organizational knowledge.},

Abstract = {This paper examines whether organizations with different collectivized

   and stock savings and loan associations (SLAs) and, notes that stock
   SLAs have superior monitoring, incentive systems, and capital structures
   in comparison with mutual SLAs. An analysis of 900 SLAs founded during
   1960-1987 indicates that mutual companies were more vulnerable than
   stock companies to competition from commercial banks, but there was no
   conclusive evidence that mutuals were more susceptible to environmental
   variability than stocks were. The results also show that deregulation
   sharply attenuated the agency advantages of stocks, implying that
   agency-cost advantages may be constrained by institutional processes.},

   Foucault, in order to problematize conventional approaches to the study
   of management and organizations that have been thought of as informed by
   a positive epistemology. Such a methodology encourages researchers to
   produce positive knowledge in the form of representations of what they
   consider to be the real world of management. This involves a
   concentration on what may be seen as the outcome of human activity in
   the form of second-order constructs, such as markets, demand and supply
   schedules. company accounts, selection techniques, or collective
   bargaining. Although those who conduct positive studies claim merely to
   report or represent the reality they observe, it is argued here that
   positive studies actually constitute the ``subjectivity{''} of
   management through their representations. In so doing, these studies
   treat the subject, whether this be an individual, a group, or a class of
   activities (such as an organization) as if it were no different from an
   object in the natural sciences. But unlike those objects.
   ``subjectivity{''} can never be finally fixed in knowledge. One reason
   for this is that once knowledge of the social world enters the public
   domain, the human conditions which rendered it possible are changed,
   thus undermining the original validity of such knowledge. Accordingly,
   positive knowledge is as precarious as the conditions (i.e., the social,
   political, and philosophical discourses and practices) that make it
   possible.},

Abstract = {The process of innovation and diffusion requires more and more
   interactions between the world of science and technology and the
   marketplace. In order to describe these dynamics, we define a
   techno-economic network (TEN) as a coordinated set of heterogeneous
   actors (public laboratories, technical research centers, industrial
   firms, users) who participate collectively in the development and
   diffusion of innovations and, via numerous interactions, organize the
   relationships between scientifico-technical research and the market.
   Although the word ``network{''} is not systematically used, there have
   been during the last years many more government interventions (that we
   call technological programs) aimed at supporting the emergence,
   constitution and growth of TENs which can attain the objectives
   corresponding to the program's pre-defined goals. Based on an empirical
   study of the French Agency for Energy Management (AFME), this article
   presents a series of concepts and tools which are designed to describe
   the morphology of TENs (are they incomplete or chained, convergent or
   dispersed, long or short?) and to analyse their dynamics. Notions like
   anticipated networks, breakthrough actions (versus continuing
   operations), intermediate results are presented. Examples of their use
   for the management and the evaluation of the technological programs are
   given.},

Abstract = {The paper develops a general, ``collective{''} model of household labor
   supply in which agents are characterized by their own (possibly
   altruistic) preferences, and household decisions are only assumed to be
   Pareto efficient. An alternative interpretation is that there are two
   stages in the internal decision process: agents first share nonlabor
   income, according to some given sharing rule; then each one optimally
   chooses his or her own labor supply and consumption. This setting is
   shown to generate testable restrictions on labor supplies. Moreover, the
   observation of labor supply behavior is sufficient for recovering
   individual preferences and the sharing rule (up to a constant). Finally,
   the traditional tools of welfare analysis can be adapted to the new
   setting.},

Title = {CONGREGATE COGNITIVE MAPS - A UNIFIED DYNAMIC THEORY OF ORGANIZATION AND
   STRATEGY},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT STUDIES},
Year = {1992},
Volume = {29},
Number = {3},
Pages = {369-389},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Recently and independently, two dynamic approaches to organization and
   strategy have emerged in fields traditionally confined to static
   methods. One approach uses the cybernetic properties of collective
   cognitive maps to create a dynamic theory of organization and social
   system change. The other approach uses the hierarchic properties of
   collective cognitive maps to create a dynamic theory of strategy.
   This article discusses how a dynamic cognitive approach makes
   organization theory and strategy theory inseparable. The approach
   distinguishes between aggregate and congregate collective cognitive
   maps. The approach creates a unified dynamic theory of organization and
   strategy.
   In this unified theory, the hierarchic and cybernetic aspects of
   collective cognitive maps combine with the cryptic aspect of concepts
   and connections present in maps to further explicate the association
   between organization and strategy.
   In practice, the cryptic character of many concepts - especially those
   responsible for the congregation of individual cognitive maps - is
   exploited to generate both a potent interview technique and a powerful
   method for facilitating the initiation and development of strategy
   workshops.},
