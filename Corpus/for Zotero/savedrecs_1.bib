Title = {Communication and Strategy Work: How corporate magazines shape strategy},
Journal = {ORGANIZATION STUDIES},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 NOV 27},
Abstract = {While research has become increasingly receptive to the construction of
   strategy in dedicated forms of strategy communication - such as
   managerial speeches or strategic plans - little work has looked at how
   strategy is constructed in more broadly focused communicative media,
   such as corporate magazines. By analysing over 500 magazine issues from
   six different firms, this article reveals three fundamental mechanisms
   by which corporate magazines shape strategy: (i) familiarization - or
   shaping strategy by connecting it to the everyday; (ii) confirmation -
   or shaping strategy by aligning it with standing norms and expectations;
   and (iii) regeneration - or shaping strategy by advancing it through
   ongoing cycles of creation and destruction. In doing so, this article
   makes three specific contributions. First, by highlighting how corporate
   magazines construct strategy through a reconciliation of different
   narrations, narrators and narrative contexts, it extends earlier
   research's emphasis on senior leadership with insights into the more
   collective sensemaking processes underlying strategy development.
   Second, by unveiling how corporate magazines often draw on affective
   expressions that humanize strategy within organizational life, it
   enriches our predominantly rational take on strategy-making with a more
   pronounced understanding of the role of emotions. Finally, by showing
   how corporate magazines progressively tie an organization's strategy to
   ongoing developments and occurrences, it expands earlier work's emphasis
   on grand and singular strategy communication with a reappreciation of
   the small and iterative - demonstrating how firms' successful conception
   of tomorrow is often based on their developing understanding of today.},

Title = {The Choices We Collectively Make: Orchestrating Hybridity to Tackle
   Grand Challenges},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT STUDIES},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 NOV 18},
Abstract = {Hybrid organizing offers new ways to address grand challenges by
   balancing profit and sustainability. However, current research on
   hybridity focuses mainly on individual organizations, while grand
   challenges involve complex networks of interconnected yet independent
   actors. This paper introduces a new perspective on hybridity showing how
   single organizations engage others to enable collective solutions.
   Through the lens of orchestration, we uncover the role of three Latin
   American stock exchanges in driving collective hybridity in a
   qualitative process study. Our multi-level model reveals the sequential
   activities of an orchestrator - catalysing, brokering, and building -
   and a process of collective tension management. We extend theory on how
   organizations can engage an entire ecosystem to adopt hybridity and how
   hybrid organizing can drive large-scale solutions to grand challenges.},

Title = {Beyond global mobility: how human capital shapes the MNE in the 21st
   century},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS STUDIES},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 NOV 18},
Abstract = {The global mobility of people has transformed how multinational
   enterprises (MNEs) manage and benefit from multiple locations. We
   examine the changing locational boundedness of human capital with
   globalization and how this has impacted the competitiveness of MNEs. The
   growing use of quasi-internalization through the active reliance on
   global value chains and outsourcing has altered the way MNEs spatially
   organize their activities to optimize their access to human capital, a
   key source of ownership advantages. We identify areas for further
   research, including new strategies for managing human resources using
   these new forms of cross-border governance. Collectively, the papers in
   this special issue provide insights into how MNEs can leverage the
   movement and reorganization of their human capital to enhance their
   unique capabilities and succeed in international business.},

Title = {Transforming Management Education: Insights from Social-Ecological
   Systems and Social Innovation Research},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT STUDIES},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 NOV 17},
Abstract = {It is clear that contemporary management education (ME) needs to be
   transformed to tackle complex social-ecological crises effectively.
   However, the concept of transformation is often ill-defined in the
   context of ME; while there is also a lack of understanding about what
   concrete transformation trajectories (also called scaling pathways) are
   available to management educators. This conceptual paper adopts a
   social-ecological systems lens to shed light on the basics of
   transformation (the why, what, where, when and who); combined with a
   social innovation lens to provide more clarity on transformation's
   practical specificity (the how). Rooted in a vision of ME aimed at
   cultivating social-ecological flourishing (i.e. a civic ME), this paper
   integrates different theoretical lenses to assert the possibility of-and
   outline trajectories for-transformation in the business school. This
   work contributes to developing a social-ecological systems approach to
   ME; while proposing multiple concrete scaling pathways to support a
   civic transformation of ME. It highlights that ME stands at a
   crossroads: management educators could passively wait until
   transformation is forced by the unintended crossing of tipping points;
   or deliberately and collectively navigate it. Ultimately, transformation
   emerges from the delicate interplay of structure (i.e. inescapable
   structural barriers) and agency (i.e. intentional transformative
   actions).},

Title = {Collectivist Culture and Corporate Tax Avoidance: Evidence from China},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ETHICS},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 NOV 17},
Abstract = {Ecological theory always treats culture as a response to the demands of
   the environment. Farming, in the history of the world, has significantly
   influenced the formation of human culture. This paper examines the
   relationship between managers' rice culture and corporate tax avoidance.
   The main finding shows managers from collectivist rice planting areas
   are less likely to engage in tax avoidance activities. This link is more
   pronounced in firms with better governance and greater gender
   diversification and in firms where managers have academic experience.
   Additionally, the relationship is enhanced in areas with higher regional
   trust areas and higher tax enforcement regions. Finally, our results are
   robust to a battery of additional analyses. Overall, our study supports
   the important role of cultural factors in corporate strategic
   decision-making.},

Title = {Three Problems of Business Addressed by Stakeholder Theory: Insights
   from the Institutional Economics of John R. Commons},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ETHICS},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 NOV 17},
Abstract = {Stakeholder theory is traditionally motivated by the need to
   reconceptualize three core problems of business: value creation and
   trade, the ethics of capitalism, and managerial mindsets. We argue that
   the need for this reconceptualization arises, in part, from the
   limitations of mainstream economic theory in grasping the evolving
   business environment. The original institutional economics of John R.
   Commons offers an alternative body of economic thought that addresses
   these limitations by replacing the atomistic individualism of mainstream
   economics with an ontology grounded in collective action. Drawing on
   Commons' insights, we demonstrate how the problem of value creation and
   trade takes on a new meaning of promoting security of expectations
   through conflict resolution and the maintenance of order. We further
   reconstruct the problem of the ethics of capitalism by drawing on
   Commons' concept of reasonableness, rooted in evolving community
   standards of morality. Finally, we trace the problem of managerial
   mindsets to Commons' category of industrial goodwill, which suggests
   that managers can deliberately pursue policies that maximize
   stakeholders' collaborative attitudes. We conclude that reconstructing
   these three problems of business through Commons' categories reveals the
   deeper institutional economics content embedded within contemporary
   stakeholder theory.},

Title = {After the Crisis: Explaining stories of professional identity growth
   from collective action},
Journal = {ORGANIZATION STUDIES},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 NOV 11},
Abstract = {Emergent forms of collaboration are central to societies' response to
   crises like natural disaster, refugee migration and pandemics. Even
   though individuals' participation in such collective action may be
   short-lived, recent studies propose it can inspire enduring professional
   role change as people return to their everyday work post-crisis. Yet,
   previous research does not focus on the divergent stories participants
   tell about the crisis years afterward and what it meant for them
   professionally. Through a grounded study of healthcare workers involved
   in the 2003 Toronto SARS outbreak, we examine varied narratives of
   professional identity growth following collective action in crisis.
   Years after SARS, participants told diverse stories about the crisis as
   an event that suspended, affirmed or even expanded their professional
   identities. Participants with narratives of identity suspension saw SARS
   as an event lacking professional relevance. Narratives of identity
   affirmation and expansion, however, emphasized growth and inspiration
   for participants' professional roles post-crisis. We theorize how
   interactions within collective responses can foster growth narratives,
   when they enhance meanings central to participants' professional
   identities and by affording follow-on interactions that translate these
   meanings into role change. We contribute new insight on how collective
   action in crisis can lead to professional role change post-crisis, how
   fragmented perspectives affect capacity for collective action in
   intermittent crises, and the role of follow-on interactions in
   professionals' narrative identity work.},

Abstract = {We propose a theory of gradualism in the implementation of good
   policies, suitable for environments featuring time consistency. We
   downplay the role of the initial period by allowing agents both to wait

   equilibrium by ignoring past history. The allocation gradually transits
   toward one that weighs both short- and long-term concerns, stopping
   short of the Ramsey outcome but greatly improving upon Markovian
   equilibria. We use the theory to account for the slow emergence of both

Abstract = {This paper studies how social media affects the dynamics of protests and
   strikes in China during 2009-2017. Based on 13.2 billion microblog
   posts, we use tweets and retweets to measure social media communication
   across cities and exploit its rapid expansion for identification. We
   find that, despite strict government censorship, Chinese social media
   has a sizeable effect on the geographical spread of protests and
   strikes. Furthermore, social media communication considerably expands
   the scope of protests by spreading events across different causes (e.g.,
   from anticorruption protests to environmental protests) and dramatically
   increases the probability of far-reaching protest waves with
   simultaneous events occurring in many cities. These effects arise even
   though Chinese social media barely circulates content that explicitly
   helps organize protests.},

Title = {Why are some nations more entrepreneurial than others? Investigating the
   link between cultural tightness-looseness and rates of new firm
   formation},
Journal = {STRATEGIC ENTREPRENEURSHIP JOURNAL},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 OCT 29},
Abstract = {Research SummaryWe evaluate the role of cultural tightness-looseness as
   an explanation for cross-cultural variation in new firm formation rates.
   Modeling cultural tightness-looseness as an antecedent for individual
   entrepreneurial dispositions and informal institutions, we examine its
   impact on the number of new limited-liability companies registered per
   1000 people and the rate of new entrepreneurs in the working-age
   population. Our findings show that cultural tightness-looseness explains
   56\% of the variation in new firm formation rates in a sample of 156
   nations, and 71\% of the variation in the rate of new entrepreneurs in
   the 50 US states, with greater cultural looseness corresponding to
   higher rates of entrepreneurship, on average. This effect is robust to
   various model specifications, measures, and controls for other cultural
   dimensions.Managerial SummaryOur study examines how cultural
   tightness-looseness impacts new firm formation rates across nations and
   US states. We find that cultural looseness, characterized by flexible
   social norms, significantly influences entrepreneurial activity.
   Specifically, it explains 56\% of the variation in new firm formation
   rates across 156 nations and 71\% of the variation in new entrepreneur
   rates in the 50 US states. Nations and states with looser cultures tend
   to have higher rates of entrepreneurship. These findings are robust
   across different model specifications, measures, and control variables.
   Managers and policymakers should consider the strength and enforcement
   of social norms as factors in fostering new firm formation.},

Title = {Cultivating dispersed collectivity: How communities between
   organizations sustain employee activism},
Journal = {HUMAN RELATIONS},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 OCT 27},
Abstract = {Pushing for social change at work is frustrating and precarious. Many
   employee activists therefore seek support in communities that form
   around their aspirations and reside `between' organizations. This
   article advances our understanding of how community participation shapes
   employee activists' experiences of their change agency as they return to
   and pursue their social purpose in their corporate lives. Grounded in an
   in-depth qualitative study of an inter-organizational community of
   employee activists, we introduce the notion of `dispersed collectivity':
   employee activists generate a shared sense of collectivity that they
   maintain even as they disperse into their workplaces. Dispersed
   collectivity enables subtle agentic experiences by emboldening employee
   activists to endure their often-challenging corporate lives, unsettle
   corporate norms, and detach from their corporate positions. Even without
   mobilizing a collective push for change across firms, communities can
   thus play a critical role in sustaining employee activism. Our study
   contributes a more nuanced account of employee activists' change agency
   and offers new theoretical insights into the role of
   inter-organizational communities in social change, the practices they
   can use to build collective momentum and empathic connections, and their
   impact on employee activists' determination to drive social change from
   within.},

Title = {Walking the Digital Tightrope: Diversity and voice in creative platform
   work},
Journal = {ORGANIZATION STUDIES},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 OCT 22},
Abstract = {This study examines how diversity shapes creative platform workers'
   access to and exercise of voice within the precarious landscape of
   platform capitalism. Drawing on Bourdieu's concepts of capital and
   field, we explore unique qualitative materials collected from 40
   Brazilian literary content creators. The findings show that creative
   platform workers' access to and exercise of voice is based on three
   conditions of privilege: playing the rules of the game; drawing on
   bundles of resources; and leveraging intermediation capacity. We
   identify four forms of voice among creative platform workers -
   shielding, demonstrating, ingroup-focused gatekeeping and affirmative
   voices - and highlight the relational dynamics of power in this context.
   This research contributes to understanding diversity in creative
   platform work through a privilege lens, thereby revealing the complex
   dynamics of power and dependence that creative platform workers
   experience with different industry stakeholders. This study contributes
   to the literature about diversity and voice by: showing that online
   prestige alone does not ensure voice opportunities; unveiling the
   variety of targets and agents in the four forms of voice in creative
   platform work; and highlighting the limitations of collective voice in
   challenging existing privilege and disadvantage systems.},

Title = {`Your Very Existence Goes Against Our Community Guidelines':
   Interrogating norms of contributorship through poetic speech acts on
   Instagram},
Journal = {ORGANIZATION STUDIES},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 OCT 21},
Abstract = {Platform organizing does not unfold in a neutral realm. While
   interconnected communicative acts such as posts, shares, or likes
   constitute organizing on social media platforms, platform organizations
   condition how such platform organizing unfolds through content
   moderation. This study engages with the concept of contributorship,
   which is anchored in communication constitutes organization (CCO)
   scholarship, and theorizes content moderation as a process of
   authorization based on `norms of contributorship'. Applying queer
   theorizing to engage with norms as a site of power vis-a-vis embodied
   difference, we investigate poetic speech acts as queering endeavours
   that interrogate norms of contributorship in the constitution of
   platform organizing. Drawing upon a qualitative analysis of Instagram
   posts that challenge content moderation related to nudity as embodied
   difference, the findings reveal three practices of poetic speech -
   playfully altering, juxtaposing wor(l)ds and satirical challenging. Such
   practices skilfully repoliticize the entanglement of communication,
   control and normativity, and lay the foundation for collectively
   queering norms of contributorship in platform organizing. Building upon
   these insights, we highlight how organizational theory and practice are
   always implicated in normative regimes and underscore the need for
   attending to the existence of organizational subjects at and beyond the
   margins through queering organizing writ large.},

   Organizational Research},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 OCT 17},
Abstract = {This special issue explores the transformative role of discrete events
   in fostering changes at different organizational levels, challenging
   traditional feature-oriented approaches that focus on stable attributes
   of individuals, groups, and organizations. Joining the growing body of
   event-oriented research in diverse settings, the nine published articles
   evoke a novel theoretical lens (i.e., Event System Theory) to examine a
   number of discrete events (e.g., everyday change events, organizational
   downsizing, merger, corporate scandal, technology implementation, the
   U.S.-China trade war, the Black Lives Matter movement). Their findings
   demonstrate the interesting ways discrete events disrupt routines,
   prompt adaptation, and impact individual and collective behaviors across
   various levels within organizations. Our further analysis underscores
   the importance of adopting an event-oriented perspective for a better
   understanding of management issues, offering new insights and directions
   for future research. We hope this special issue provides a robust
   foundation for integrating event-centric research approaches into
   organizational theory, emphasizing the need for continued empirical
   investigation and theoretical refinement in a variety of management
   research domains, such as strategic management, organizational behavior,
   entrepreneurship, and human resource management.},

Title = {The Cost of Dancing with the Government: A Conservation of Resources
   Theory of Political Networking and CEO Burnout},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT STUDIES},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 OCT 14},
Abstract = {Although prior research on the dark side of corporate political activity
   (CPA) has examined the negative impact of CPA on firms from the
   perspective of the macro cost of CPA (i.e., organizational loss) and the
   self-interested motives of executives (i.e., personal gain), it has
   largely overlooked the negative repercussions of CPA for individuals
   intimately engaged in that process (i.e., personal loss). Drawing on the
   conservation of resources (COR) theory and focusing on Chief Executives
   Officers (CEOs) who engage in political networking (PN), we investigate
   how PN affects CEO burnout. We conceptualize PN as a form of relational
   exchanges between firms and political entities, positing that PN entails
   substantial resource depletion for those deeply involved, primarily due
   to significant ethical and moral challenges (i.e., identity threat). As
   PN intensifies, CEOs are compelled to allocate more time, effort and
   energy to navigate these escalating challenges, consequently
   exacerbating CEO burnout. Through the analysis of a 2-year matched
   survey of CEOs and comprehensive archive data, we find robust support
   for our hypothesis. Furthermore, our findings suggest that CEO altruism
   and institutional knowledge weaken the relationship between PN and CEO
   burnout, indicating that individual intentions to benefit the collective
   and the ability to navigate such networking practices alter CEOs'
   perceived identity challenges. Our study contributes an individual-level
   resource-depletion perspective of CPA and cautions against the
   propensity of CEOs to engage in CPA driven by Machiavellian logic.},

Title = {`Let's Go to the Land Instead': Indigenous Perspectives on Biodiversity
   and the Possibilities of Regenerative Capital},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT STUDIES},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 OCT 3},
Abstract = {The land has been a source of capital accumulation since colonization
   through extractive activities like mining and industrial agriculture.
   Indigenous peoples have profoundly different relationships with the
   land, which are more relational than extractive. However, their
   knowledge has been subjugated by and systematically excluded from
   Western conservation policies, which are based on colonial modes of
   control. We begin to address this issue by elaborating on a
   community-based participatory project, namely a Conservation Impact Bond
   (CIB), developed in Canada with Deshkan Ziibiing. This CIB was unique
   since it combined Indigenous and Western knowledges and aimed at
   restoring ecosystems by building relationships of kinship between
   peoples and the land. Based on our findings, we propose a Two-Eyed
   Seeing relationship-building process model - a multi-stakeholder
   initiative (MSI) incorporating Indigenous and Western knowledges. We
   discuss the implications of our findings for mobilizing capital to serve
   collective rather than private interests while promoting Indigenous
   resurgence and land regeneration. We suggest shifting from extractive to
   regenerative capital is necessary to address the climate and
   biodiversity loss crises. This transformation could be achieved by
   embracing a relational ontology through Two-Eyed Seeing.},

Abstract = {In this essay, we present Michael Polanyi's theory of knowledge and
   outline its implications for theory development in organizational
   research. While Polanyi is best known in the field for his concept of
   tacit knowledge, we discuss here several other cognate concepts Polanyi
   has also introduced-notably conviviality, indwelling, tradition and
   lore, coherence, and post-critical reason-and show how they help us
   better understand organizational theorizing. Specifically, we argue the
   following. First, when engaged in theory creation, organizational
   scholars integrate largely unspecifiable particulars, in search of
   deepening coherence, by dwelling in a fiduciary framework of previous
   theory, others' narrativized experiences, and their own personal
   experiences. Secondly, driven by intellectual passions and commitments,
   organizational scholars bring about conceptual novelty by seeking to
   redirect intellectual attention to hitherto tacitly accepted subsidiary
   particulars, which they seek to reintegrate in novel ways. And, thirdly,
   since all knowledge, no matter how abstract, necessarily involves
   skillful action, organizational scholars dwell in scientific practice
   and, therefore, interiorize-that is, they become subsidiarily aware
   of-the practice's collective purpose, which they freely and responsibly
   enact through the exercise of public liberty.},

Title = {FAKING IT WITH THE BOSS'S JOKES? LEADER HUMOR QUANTITY, FOLLOWER SURFACE
   ACTING, AND POWER DISTANCE},
Journal = {ACADEMY OF MANAGEMENT JOURNAL},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {67},
Number = {5},
Pages = {1175-1206},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Most scholarly work concludes that leader humor positively affects
   emotional outcomes for followers. However, two interrelated issues with
   past research make this view incomplete: (a) studies often conflate the
   act of expressing humor with the humor's effectiveness, and (b) existing
   research overlooks follower emotion regulation. In addressing these
   issues, we generate and test new theory that challenges the theoretical
   consensus, highlighting why and when leader humor expression has
   emotional costs for followers. Specifically, we theorize that leader
   humor quantity, irrespective of its quality, puts pressure on followers
   to engage in ``surface acting{''} to fake or exaggerate positive
   emotions. We further propose that these surface acting responses are
   more likely to occur when followers hold high power distance values,
   such that followers more willingly comply with expectations to display
   positive emotions in response to leader humor expression. This increase
   in surface acting then leads to more emotional exhaustion and less job
   satisfaction for followers. Results from three studies-incorporating a
   field experiment, a laboratory experiment, and a multi-wave field
   study-provide support for these hypotheses. We close with a discussion
   of how our findings provide a unique counterpoint regarding the effects
   of leader humor on follower emotional outcomes.},

Abstract = {In a workforce characterized by constant disruption across social,
   economic, and environmental domains, as well as widespread employee
   suffering in the form of stress, burnout, and disengagement, both
   scholars and leaders have called for business to undergo transformative
   change in an effort to bring about collective flourishing. Drawing
   inspiration from Buddhist philosophy and research on the communicative
   constitution of organizations, we present a new theory that explains how
   organizations can foster a positive form of organizing-what we term
   humanistic organizing-through a tripartite framework of mindful
   organizational communication. Our theory demonstrates that transforming
   organizations to become more humanistic is a matter of rethinking an
   organization's underlying ethos, grounding that new ethos in humanistic
   principles, and then: (a) embedding the wisdom of this new ethos in
   organizational communication, (b) intentionally drawing on this wisdom
   in everyday talk and text, and (c) ethically enacting this wisdom in the
   form of ongoing organizing practices, which may include revising the
   preexisting organizing practices. We illustrate our theory through two
   case illustrations: one that reflects an organization that has
   demonstrated humanistic organizing from its inception, and another that
   reflects an organization that underwent a transformative process to
   become more humanistic.},

Title = {`We Can Win this Fight Together': Memory and Cross-Occupational
   Coordination},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT STUDIES},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 SEP 29},
Abstract = {While scholars have studied coordination across occupational lines, they
   have yet to theorize how the memories held by those involved in such
   coordination might influence it. In this paper, we frame occupational
   groups as mnemonic communities - collectives for whom a shared
   understanding of the past constitutes their character - to explore the
   role of memory in cross-occupational coordination (COC). Through
   qualitative analysis of a South Korean broadcasting company in which COC
   emerged for the purpose of collective action, we develop a theory of
   cross-occupational mnemonic (dis)unity. Our findings suggest that,
   initially, cross-occupational relational memories (i.e., memories
   occupations held of themselves, other occupations and their
   relationships) constrained COC as they maintained occupational divides.
   However, one occupation's efforts to downplay these memories, coupled
   with an event experienced and remembered across occupational lines,
   resulted in COC by producing a cross-occupational mnemonic community.
   These findings extend research at the intersection of occupations and
   memory by theorizing the mutability of occupational groups, perhaps the
   most prominent intra-organizational mnemonic communities.},

Title = {New Horizons for Newcomer Organizational Socialization: A Review,
   Meta-Analysis, and Future Research Directions},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 SEP 20},
Abstract = {The effective socialization of newcomers into organizations is critical
   for employee and organizational success. As such, ensuring successful
   onboarding has become even more pivotal for newcomer adjustment,
   performance, and retention. The literature has seen significant growth
   and incorporated new theoretical perspectives, such as resource-based
   approaches since the most recent comprehensive meta-analytic review of
   the literature. Therefore, we extended earlier reviews by presenting an
   updated model of the socialization process, reviewing the literature,
   and examining this updated model via meta-analysis. In all, we
   identified 256 studies that met our meta-analytic inclusion criteria,
   and 183 with sufficient k across construct categories were included in
   our meta-analysis. At the correlational level, we analyzed antecedents
   to proximal adjustment indicators and proximal adjustment to distal
   outcomes. We examined a potential moderator, whether the study took
   place in a horizontal-individualistic (HI) versus
   vertical-collectivistic (VC) culture. Last, we analyzed a path model to
   identify unique relationships between specific antecedents (age,
   full-time work experience, organizational tenure, proactive personality,
   information seeking, organizational tactics, insider
   mentoring/supporting), proximal adjustment indicators (social
   acceptance, role clarity, task mastery, perceived fit), and distal
   outcomes (job satisfaction, organizational commitment, turnover
   intentions, other-rated performance, and well-being). Our analyses
   uncover the role of proactive personality and proactive newcomer
   behaviors in newcomer adjustment and the importance of social acceptance
   for newcomers. They also identify perceptions of fit as an important but
   relatively under-examined adjustment indicator and newcomer well-being
   as an additional socialization outcome. We develop future directions for
   socialization theory and research methods.},

Title = {Not just one woman at a time: Re-radicalizing a feminist project at work
   in a postfeminist era},
Journal = {HUMAN RELATIONS},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 SEP 20},
Abstract = {Feminism is back, but is it? What does the contemporary popularity of
   feminism mean for the feminist subject and the feminist project in
   western organizations? This is the question that lies at the heart of
   this article. We observe how postfeminism - as a key source for
   feminism's contemporary attractiveness - individualizes the feminist
   subject as empowered, choosing and self-transforming. However, feelings
   of affective incongruity between what is promised and what is delivered
   in postfeminist times provide an entry point for a re-radicalization of
   the feminist project. To examine how the disappointed postfeminist
   subject can challenge organizations, we return to the feminist concepts
   of collectivity and patriarchy. We update the notion of collectivity
   through fusion with network sociality, breaking with a traditional
   understanding of stable collaboration, and emphasizing diverse
   experiences and transient, intense collective encounters. Returning to
   patriarchy, we present it as `stunningly adaptable' and the unsanitized
   interpretation of the struggle for equality. It is the context for the
   disappointment that can spark temporary intense collective action for
   intersectional equality. Finally, we identify the contours of a research
   agenda to explore how to radicalize the feminist subject to take forward
   a feminist project of intersectional equality.},

Title = {Riding the waves of uncertainty: Towards strategic agility in medicine
   supply systems},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 SEP 20},
Abstract = {We investigate how organizations embedded in a supply system
   collectively respond to risks and seize opportunities arising from
   crisis events under shifting forms of uncertainty. Using the United
   Kingdom (UK) medicine supply system as the research context, we explore
   how decision-makers navigated the effects of an event with knowable
   implications (UK's European Union exit, 2016-2020) followed by an event
   with unknowable implications (COVID-19 global pandemic, 2020-2021). We
   adopt a longitudinal case research design that incorporates causal loop
   diagramming, to understand the system's responses. We find that learning
   evolves as crisis events unfold, changing from surface (know-what) to
   deep (know-why and -how) and at the highest level, it is transcendent.
   Transcendent learning entails understanding system effects into the
   future (i.e., beyond the past and present) and in relation to other
   supply systems (i.e., beyond the UK system). Capabilities to absorb,
   avoid, and accelerate away from shocks are developed sequentially as
   learning changes. We contribute to prior research by developing a theory
   of system-level strategic agility and the adaptation processes that
   underpin it. The latter hinge on dynamic resource (re)allocation and the
   continuous (re)configuration of processes, protocols, regulations, and
   structures.
   In supply systems, learning evolves as crisis events unfold, changing
   from surface (know-what) to deep (know-why and -how) to transcendent
   (understanding system effects into the future and in relation to other
   supply systems). As learning changes, supply systems sequentially
   develop the capability to absorb, avoid, and accelerate away from
   shocks. Supply systems develop strategic agility, that is, the ability
   constantly and rapidly sense and respond to changes in the environment,
   based on the learning that has occurred; success further hinges on
   dynamic resource (re)allocation and the continuous (re)configuration of
   processes, protocols, regulations, and structures.},

Title = {Ethicality in B2B Service Delivery: Examining the Impact of Individual
   and Organisational Ethics on Firm Performance Through Ethical Leadership
   and Climate},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ETHICS},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 SEP 20},
Abstract = {The criticality of ethical practices in B2B service delivery is
   increasingly recognised for its substantial impact on firm performance.
   However, there remains a gap in understanding how ethicality at
   managerial and staff levels translates into tangible business outcomes
   in B2B contexts. This study aims to bridge this gap, focusing on the
   impact of ethicality on perceived service delivery performance and firm
   performance, mainly through ethical leadership and climate lenses. The
   research objectives include unravelling the dynamics between staff-level
   ethical perceptions and managerial-level ethical practices and their
   collective impact on service delivery and firm performance. Employing a
   multilevel data collection and analytical framework, the study collected
   data from 5500 employees and 110 managers, providing a comprehensive
   view of ethical influences across different organisational strata. This
   approach facilitated a nuanced examination of how ethical perceptions
   and behaviours permeate through the organisational hierarchy. Major
   findings reveal that individual-level ethical perceptions enhance
   service delivery through positive citizenship behaviour of the employees
   and reduced opportunism. A culture of shared ethical values, reinforced
   by robust ethical leadership and a supportive climate, significantly
   bolstered firm performance at the organisational level. These insights
   contribute significantly to B2B theory by elucidating the mechanisms
   through which ethicality at various levels influences firm outcomes. The
   study underscores the importance of fostering an ethical culture at the
   individual level and holistically across the organisation to enhance
   service delivery and achieve superior firm performance.},

Title = {Organizational Selection of Innovation},
Journal = {ORGANIZATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 SEP 19},
Abstract = {Budgetary constraints force organizations to pursue only a subset of
   possible innovation projects. Identifying which subset is most promising
   is an error-prone exercise, and involving multiple decision makers may
   be prudent. This raises the question of how to most effectively
   aggregate their collective nous. Our model of organizational portfolio
   selection provides some first answers. We show that portfolio
   performance can vary widely. Delegating evaluation makes sense when
   organizations employ the relevant experts and can assign projects to
   them. In most other settings, aggregating the impressions of multiple
   agents leads to better performance than delegation. In particular,
   letting agents rank projects often outperforms alternative aggregation
   rules-including averaging agents' project scores and counting their
   approval votes-especially when organizations have tight budgets and can
   select only a few project alternatives out of many.},

Abstract = {We review the research on organization design from 2000 to 2023,

   the contemporary literature: configuration, control, channelization, and
   coordination. We discuss the key streams of research that characterize
   each of these approaches, as well as three emerging areas of research:
   AI and organizational decision-making, flat organizations, and multiple
   goals. Beyond the specific contributions of individual papers and
   streams of work, our review makes a number of high-level observations
   across approaches. We identify patterns that characterize this body of
   work, the methods used, open questions for future research, and a
   discussion of organization design as a theory. Collectively, these
   observations define the state of organization design research and may
   provide scholars with a foundation for future research.},

Title = {A Configurational Perspective on the Quality of Managers' Counterfactual
   Reflections},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 SEP 18},
Abstract = {Counterfactual reflection (CFR)-thinking about ``what might have been
   if{''}-can enhance learning from experience, but only if the CFR is
   high-quality. Yet, what shapes differences in CFR quality remains
   largely unknown. Because managers typically reflect on experiences by
   concomitantly considering relevant factors and their collective
   interdependencies, we suggest that CFR quality is causally complex. To
   investigate this possibility, we interviewed 129 managers. In these
   interviews, they reflected on recently concluded business-to-business
   negotiations. Using fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis, we find
   three equifinal configurations of negotiation factors associated with
   high-quality CFR and eight associated with low-quality CFR. Drawing on
   the interviews, we identify managers' ability to disentangle causal
   linkages in their past negotiation and their motivation for high-quality
   CFR in the present as plausible mechanisms underlying differences in CFR
   quality. We find high-quality CFR only following experiences where
   managers possess high levels of both situation-specific ability and
   motivation. In contrast, experiences that leave managers feeling unable
   or unmotivated due to high satisfaction, indifference, or defensiveness,
   are linked to low-quality CFR. Overall, our study advances understanding
   of why there are differences in CFR quality by linking past experiences
   with managers' abilities and motivation. From a managerial perspective,
   we suggest that organizations avoid ``one size fits all{''} approaches
   to CFR. Instead, we recommend actionable measures for both reflecting
   managers and their supervisors to address the specific reasons that
   prevent managers from engaging in high-quality CFR after their
   negotiation experiences.},

Title = {Can You Go Home Again? Performance Assistance Between Boomerangs and
   Incumbent Employees},
Journal = {ORGANIZATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 SEP 13},
Abstract = {Boomerangs, that is, rehires, should have advantages over other new
   hires when integrating into an organization due to their familiarity
   with the work context and their pre-existing relationships. However,
   research suggests that the effects of hiring boomerangs may not be
   straightforwardly positive. To better understand these effects, we
   investigate how boomerangs' social integration into a work team differs
   from that of other new hires due to their pre-existing relationships and
   how those relationships shape their and incumbents' competence and
   motivation to provide assistance for collective performance. We theorize
   and find that boomerangs, compared with new hires, exhibit more
   performance assistance toward incumbent former and incumbent new
   colleagues. In contrast, incumbent former colleagues do not direct their
   performance assistance toward boomerangs, contrary to our prediction,
   nor do incumbent new colleagues. This study contributes to the nascent
   literature on boomerangs and the literature on job mobility by finding
   evidence that prior relationships condition the behavior of both
   boomerangs and incumbents.},

Title = {Multimodal Collective Sensemaking in Extreme Contexts: Evidence from
   Maritime Search and Rescue},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT STUDIES},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 SEP 10},
Abstract = {In extreme contexts, actors must often engage in collective sensemaking
   to enable coordinated action. While prior research has established that
   cognitive disparities and emotive distractions disrupt collective
   sensemaking, we lack theory on how actors overcome these common
   challenges in extreme contexts. To address this shortcoming, we
   conducted a process study, collecting unique multi-perspective video and
   archival data during a maritime search and rescue mission in the Aegean
   Sea where actors (i.e., rescue crew members and refugees) faced
   cognitive disparities (e.g., different levels of maritime expertise) and
   distracting emotions (e.g., fear, anxiety, and tension) yet needed to
   coordinate their actions to ensure a safe evacuation. We draw on this
   data to develop a collective sensemaking model that details the
   auxiliary process steps and multimodal communication - verbal,
   para-verbal, and non-verbal cues - actors use to alternately frame
   emotional states and convey task-related information. Our model
   demonstrates how actors, through multimodal collective sensemaking,
   overcome the challenges posed by cognitive disparities and distracting
   emotions in extreme contexts. It thus adds a dynamic emotive and bodily
   perspective to the predominantly cognitive and verbal understanding in
   sensemaking theory, and also has implications for practitioners working
   in extreme contexts.},

Title = {Do Boards Reward and Punish CEOs Based on Employee Satisfaction Ratings?},
Journal = {ORGANIZATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 SEP 6},
Abstract = {We investigate whether boards of directors reward and punish chief
   executive officers (CEOs) based on employee satisfaction ratings. Using
   data from Glassdoor, we find that CEOs tend to receive larger bonuses
   when employee satisfaction ratings increase. Similarly, we find a higher
   rate of CEO dismissal when employees become less satisfied. Further, we
   investigate three factors that may amplify the role of employee
   satisfaction ratings in CEO evaluations: the importance of employees to
   financial performance, the board's commitment to stakeholders, and the
   need to preserve firm reputation. We find some evidence that each of
   these three factors strengthens the relationship between employee
   satisfaction ratings and CEO evaluations. Finally, we exploit the
   staggered timing of first-time reviews on Glassdoor and use a
   difference-in-differences design to strengthen our inferences.
   Collectively, these findings suggest that boards' evaluations of CEO
   compensation and retention incorporate employee satisfaction ratings.},

Title = {How Context Shapes Collective Turnover Over Time: The Relative Impact of
   Internal Versus External Factors},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF APPLIED PSYCHOLOGY},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 SEP 5},
Abstract = {Despite the prevalence of research on the consequences of collective
   turnover (TO), we lack an understanding of how, when, and why changes in
   the external environment influence collective turnover. The present
   study extends context emergent turnover and threat-rigidity theories to
   consider temporal changes in rates of collective turnover brought on by
   an external disruption. We also conduct variance decomposition to
   evaluate the relative influence of internal and external factors on
   collective turnover and examine how changes in the external environment
   impact relative influences. Finally, we examine the role of collective
   engagement in explaining patterns of collective turnover over time. Our
   study is based on a large, geographically dispersed U.S. firm. Findings
   from a two-phase longitudinal model reveal that rates of collective
   turnover change over time in ways that are predictable from
   threat-rigidity theory. Variance decomposition analysis finds that
   internal store-level factors explain substantially more variance than
   external factors, but the balance changes in response to an external
   disruption. We also show that collective engagement can mitigate
   increases in collective turnover. Results inform theory regarding the
   relative importance of internal versus external factors in influencing
   collective turnover and provide a framework for predicting how
   contextual change in the external environment impacts collective
   turnover over time.},

Title = {Signaling Theory: State of the Theory and Its Future},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 SEP 3},
Abstract = {Signaling theory is about decision-making and communication. It
   describes scenarios where signalers send observable signals that carry
   credible information about unobservable qualities. When decision-makers
   have incomplete or imperfect information, signals can help them make
   better decisions. The power of a signal, though, lies in its cost, with
   the best signals being highly costly for low-quality signalers and less
   costly for high-quality signalers. Given the centrality of these ideas
   in the organizational sciences, we examine management studies that use
   signaling theory to help explain phenomena that occur within and among
   organizations. Our review draws attention to how signaling theorists
   have introduced important complexities to the signaling process,
   uncovered theoretical boundary conditions of signaling, described new
   actors within signaling systems, and demonstrated novel ways to apply
   signaling theory to understand behavior in an array of research contexts
   involving a wide range of organizational stakeholders. We also offer
   ideas about how scholars can account for costs when they apply the
   theory, extend the theory in more organizational settings, and create
   abstract extensions of the theory's major concepts. Our intent is to
   provide researchers with a panoramic perspective on the state of
   signaling theory and inspire further development so that we can
   collectively advance signaling theory as much in the next decade as it
   has advanced in the last.},

   declines with n. For finite n, optimal HO mechanisms provide substantial

Abstract = {Does self-governance, a hallmark of democratic societies, foster norms
   of generalized cooperation? Does this effect persist, and if so, why? I
   investigate these questions using a natural experiment in Switzerland.
   In the Middle Ages, the absence of an heir resulted in the extinction of
   a prominent noble dynasty. As a result, some Swiss municipalities became
   self-governing, whereas the others remained under feudalism for another
   600 years. Evidence from a behavioral experiment, the World Values
   Survey and the Swiss Household Panel consistently show that individuals
   from historically self-governing municipalities exhibit stronger norms
   of cooperation today. Referenda data on voter-turnout allow me to trace
   these effects on individually costly and socially beneficial actions for
   over 150 years. Furthermore, norms of cooperation map into prosocial
   behaviors like charitable giving and environmental protection. Uniquely,
   Switzerland tracks every family's place of origin in registration data,
   which I use to demonstrate persistence from cultural transmission in a
   context of historically low migration.},

Title = {Framing Collective Moral Responsibility for Climate Change: A
   Longitudinal Frame Analysis of Energy Company Climate Reporting},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ETHICS},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 AUG 26},
Abstract = {Responding to climate change and avoiding irreversible climate tipping
   points requires radical and drastic action by 2030. This urgency raises
   serious questions for energy companies, one of the world's largest
   emitters of greenhouse gases (GHGs), in terms of how they frame, and
   reframe, their response to climate change. Despite the majority of
   energy companies releasing ambitious statements declaring net zero
   carbon ambitions, this `talk' has not been matched with sufficient
   urgency or substantive climate action. To unpack the disconnect between
   talk and action, this paper draws on the literature on framing,
   organisational hypocrisy, and collective moral responsibility. We
   conduct a longitudinal qualitative content analysis of the framing of
   climate change used by the ten largest European investor-owned energy
   companies and the actions they have taken to shift their business
   practices. Our findings reveal three main categories of energy
   companies: (i) deflecting, (ii) stagnating, and (iii) evolving. We show
   key differences in the relationship between framing and action over time
   for each category, revealing how deflecting companies have larger and
   persistent gaps between green talk and concrete action and how
   stagnating companies are delaying action despite increased green talk,
   while evolving companies exhibit a closer link between talk and action
   that tends to be realised over time. Our analysis reveals how competing
   approaches to framing collective moral responsibility help understand
   the trajectories of talk and action across the different categories of
   energy companies. This research makes several contributions to the
   literature on organisational hypocrisy and collective moral
   responsibility in the context of climate change. Our analysis highlights
   the complex relationship between collective moral responsibility,
   organisational hypocrisy and climate action, revealing how different
   collective framings-diffuse, teleological, or agential-can both enable
   and offset substantive climate action. The study also enriches our
   understanding of the performative nature of collective moral
   responsibility by examining its temporal dimensions and showing how an
   agential, backward-looking focus is associated with more meaningful
   climate action.},

Title = {`From the Ivory Tower'? Memory Workers and Mnemonic Practices in
   Communities},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT STUDIES},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 AUG 25},
Abstract = {Memory work involves mnemonic practices such as remembering, forgetting,
   and enactment of the past to address past wrongdoing, foster future
   action, and contribute to a sense of belonging. Working with diversity
   and plurality of memories, however, necessitates confronting the
   underlying politico-ethical considerations and struggles when memory
   work transcends organizational bounds. This study focuses on the
   viewpoints of memory workers in communities in order to theorize the
   various possibilities and limitations of memory work as such. In this
   work, the politico-ethical tensions are evident between the requirements
   of practicing an occupation and those of the communities, who in turn
   exhibit hierarchies, conflicts, and diversity within and between
   themselves. I suggest that taking a community-centric approach to memory
   work can serve the dynamic integrity of memories, and foster community
   engagement and empowerment. Memory workers, then, can account for the
   politico-ethical struggles over memories by orchestrating interpretive,
   open, and embodied mnemonic practices to remain in tune with the
   diverse, disputed, polyvocal, and ever-unfolding memories. The
   contributions of this paper carry implications for a more pluralistic
   and dynamic approach to memory work, suited to our times marked by
   increased historical consciousness, rival memories, and fierce debates
   over what and how must be remembered.},

Title = {The Effect of the Federal Judicial System on Public Enforcement:
   Evidence from SEC Enforcement Actions},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ACCOUNTING RESEARCH},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 AUG 22},
Abstract = {This study examines whether the efficiency of federal district courts
   affects the likelihood of SEC enforcement. The results indicate that the
   SEC is less likely to initiate enforcement actions against firms in less
   efficient federal district courts. In addition, the study examines the
   implications of court efficiency for firms' financial reporting quality
   (FRQ). The evidence suggests that firms residing in more efficient
   federal districts have higher FRQ and the effect is stronger in
   subsamples with weak private enforcement regimes. Additional analysis of
   the choice of venue suggests that the SEC's decision to file in the
   District Court for D.C. is not affected by local court efficiency.
   Collectively, this study highlights the importance of an efficient
   federal judicial system for public enforcement.},

Title = {The Prosocial Ambassador Effect: Adopting an Ambassador Role Increases
   Sustainable Behavior},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MARKETING},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 AUG 21},
Abstract = {This research introduces the prosocial ambassador effect as a novel
   means to elicit prosocial behavior. Consumers adopt a prosocial
   ambassador role when they personally commit to engage in a prosocial
   behavior and interpersonally promote (i.e., encourage another person to
   engage in) the prosocial behavior. Four experiments, including two
   studies in the field, investigate prosocial ambassadorship behaviors and
   their impact on the ambassadors' subsequent prosocial behavior. Results
   reveal that the ambassador role activates a collective identity, which
   drives prosocial behavior. Findings also indicate that the ambassador
   effect endures over time. Furthermore, the ambassador effect replicates
   via product giveaways and communications (e.g., text messages). This
   research offers novel implications for marketers on the ambassador
   role's positive impact on prosociality, providing guidance to firms on
   how to leverage the ambassador effect in the marketplace.},

   Performance},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ETHICS},

Month = {2024 AUG 20},
Abstract = {Leveraging the staggered introduction of specialized bankruptcy courts
   across China as an exogenous shock, this study examines the impact of
   specialized bankruptcy courts on corporate ESG performance. Using listed
   firms in China from 2015 to 2021, we find that the introduction of
   specialized bankruptcy courts leads to an increase in corporate ESG
   performance. Our main results remain robust after considering
   endogeneity concerns and TWFE bias. The underlying mechanism is that
   these courts strengthen creditor protection, thereby enhancing access to
   bank loans for local firms. Moreover, this effect is more pronounced in
   firms with limited access to bank financing and in cities with more
   efficient legal and financial environments. Collectively, our study
   contributes a novel perspective to the discourse in law and finance,
   underscoring the broader implications of judicial reforms on corporate
   ethical behavior.},

Title = {Anatomical Depiction: How Showing a Product's Inner Structure Shapes
   Product Valuations},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MARKETING},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 AUG 14},
Abstract = {Anatomical depiction is a technique whereby the product is decomposed
   into components that are spatially arranged layer by layer to visually
   explicate its inner structure. The authors demonstrate that anatomical
   depiction, compared with nonanatomical depiction, enhances product
   valuation. This effect occurs because anatomical depiction elicits a
   ``coming together{''} of the inner components in consumers' minds,
   thereby evoking a gestalt image of the product-a process labeled
   ``simulated assemblage.{''} The elicitation of simulated assemblage in
   turn boosts confidence in the product's performance. Two field
   experiments demonstrate that anatomical depiction leads to greater
   engagement in online settings such as peer-to-peer selling and social
   media advertising. Subsequently, seven laboratory and online experiments
   show when and how anatomical depiction elicits simulated assemblage
   (Studies 1a-c), test the process underlying the effect of anatomical
   depiction on product valuation (Studies 2a-b), and delineate two
   boundary conditions, showing that the positive effect of anatomical (vs.
   nonanatomical) depiction attenuates for consumers higher (vs. lower) in
   technology anxiety (Study 3) and when consumers have a hedonic (vs.
   utilitarian) consumption goal (Study 4). Collectively, this work
   provides insights to firms on how and when to use anatomical depiction
   to enhance consumers' confidence in and valuation of the product.},

Title = {Emergence in Context: How Team-Client Psychological Contract Fulfillment
   Is Associated With the Emergence of Team Identification or Team-Member
   Exchange},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF APPLIED PSYCHOLOGY},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 AUG 8},
Abstract = {Psychological contracts have been theorized to occur at different levels
   of analysis and with different exchange parties. In this article, we
   develop the concept of team-client psychological contract fulfillment
   (team-client PCF) as a team-level social exchange indicator, reflecting
   the team members' perceptions of the degree of fulfillment of the
   commitments a client promised to a team. Using the multilevel
   group-process framework (Lang et al., 2019) and a sample of newly formed
   self-managed teams consisting of 838 observations, nested in 244
   individuals, 56 teams, and in four waves of data, we tested the claim
   that team-client PCF may determine the type of collective states that
   emerge within the team. When team-client PCF is higher, it should create
   conditions for the emergence of team states related to team maintenance
   (i.e., team identification), whereas when team-client PCF is lower, it
   is more likely that teams develop states related to the regulation of
   team performance (i.e., team-member exchange {[}TMX]). Our results
   support our hypotheses. We discuss implications for both the
   psychological contract literature as well as the team dynamics
   literature (especially team dynamics of team identification and TMX).},

Title = {Why a Little Diversity doesn't Go a Long Way: A Collective Moral
   Licensing Explanation for Homosocial Reproduction},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT STUDIES},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 AUG 7},
Abstract = {Despite significant knowledge on the demographic composition of
   workgroups, the literature lacks group-level theory that addresses the
   tendency of work groups with token levels of diversity to maintain their
   demographic imbalance over time. We explain this phenomenon by extending
   moral licensing theory to the group level, arguing that a token level of
   racial or gender diversity leads to the development of a collective
   moral credential. This credential provides psychological permission for
   groups to relax their moral strivings, such that they are less likely to
   question the influence of bias in group member selection decisions, and
   thus more likely to make subsequent homogenous group member additions.
   Additionally, we argue that the diversity climates within which groups
   are embedded can either magnify (i.e., in fairness-focused diversity
   climates) or mitigate (i.e., in synergy-focused diversity climates) the
   development of a collective moral credential. Further, we suggest that
   the effect of token levels of diversity on the development of a
   collective moral credential can be affected by the prevailing social
   norms for diversity. Finally, we theorize that the effects of this
   process can be accentuated by group use of a majority decision rule and
   attenuated by group use of a unanimous decision rule.},

Title = {Agency Without Agents: Affective Forces, Communicative Events, and
   Organizational Becomings},
Journal = {ORGANIZATION STUDIES},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {45},
Number = {9, SI},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {How does agency emerge eventfully in processes of organizational
   becoming? This article aims to address this question by developing a
   process theory of agency based on Gilbert Simondon's philosophical
   writings on individuation as a communicative phenomenon and Brian
   Massumi's writings on affect. This theory views agency as an affective
   force, expressed as a communicative event, that governs the transition
   from one process of individuation to another, producing an enhanced
   ability to act and potentially leading to a collective process of
   transindividuation that is essential to organizational becoming. In
   turn, this article not only offers novel theoretical as well as
   methodological insights for organizational research, but also highlights
   researchers' ethical responsibilities toward those whose individuation
   is precarious and who may not be able to partake in certain processes of
   organizational becoming.},

Title = {Algorithmic Embeddedness and the `Gig' Characteristics Model: Examining
   the Interplay between Technology and Work Design in Crowdwork},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT STUDIES},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 AUG 2},
Abstract = {This article systematically reviews the literature on online task
   crowdwork to investigate the complex relationship between technology and
   work design on crowdwork platforms. We highlight the diverse
   interpretations and uses of technology, specifically platform features
   and algorithms, in relation to work design. Our review reveals that
   platform features serve as antecedents to work design characteristics,
   while algorithms are so intertwined with job execution that a new work
   characteristic is needed to model this interplay. We introduce this new
   work characteristic as algorithmic embeddedness and show that it varies
   in degree. When high, algorithmic embeddedness can be perceived as
   either an affordance or a constraint; when low, it has a limited impact
   on crowdworkers' jobs. Our `gig characteristics model' expands previous
   work design theories and offers a framework for understanding the design
   of contemporary jobs that rely highly on algorithms. To refine our model
   and better understand crowdwork dynamics, we provide an agenda for
   future research directions.},

Title = {The Expansion of Alternative Forms of Organizing Integration: Imitation,

Journal = {JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ETHICS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {194},
Number = {4, SI},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {This paper examines how alternative forms of organising integration in
   resource-scarce environments expand across settings, by considering the
   role of local embeddedness and an ethic of care in enabling this
   expansion. It builds on theories of imitation in organization studies in
   combination with theories of ethics of care and bricolage applied to
   welfare and migration studies. The paper is informed by the case of
   Yalla Trappan, a work cooperative of immigrant women in the city of Malm
   \& ouml;, Sweden, and the attempts to diffuse this organization and its
   methods to other cities in the country. The findings indicate that the
   expansion of alternative forms of integration into resource-scarce
   contexts is enabled by simultaneous practices of imitation and
   bricolage, ingrained in an ethic of care. The article shows, first, how
   many important practices were developed by imitating accounts of the
   original ideas, through a broadcasting mode of imitation. Next, it
   explains why the local translation of these practices in resource-scarce
   contexts, consisting of `bricolage work' based on material, market,
   institutional, human, and cultural elements, was necessary. The
   conclusion is that the expansion of novel forms of integration requires
   imitation, but of a kind that involves the bricolage of local
   translations. Such bricolage is always collective (which does not
   diminish the importance of individual agency), multi-spatial and not
   just local, and wrapped in an ethic of care, rather than in an economic
   logic. The article concludes by discussing the implications of these
   findings with the ethics of migration.},

Journal = {ACADEMY OF MANAGEMENT JOURNAL},

Volume = {67},

Abstract = {One of the greatest challenges of multi-stakeholder partnerships lies in
   forging a shared understanding and obtaining and sustaining commitment
   among parties representing different interests and goals. While studies
   have emphasized the importance of developing shared frames for enabling
   collaboration and collective action through frame alignment, scant
   attention has been paid to how stakeholder representatives can attain
   commitment from their constituents ``back home{''} to frames negotiated
   on their behalf. Our longitudinal process study explores how
   participants in the German Partnership for Sustainable Textiles
   successfully confronted the challenge of aligning frames across multiple
   interaction arenas, highlighting how failing to tackle this ``two-table
   problem{''} can risk partnership collapse. Our process model captures
   how back-and-forth interactions enabled the stretching of shared frames
   across interaction arenas, thereby propelling the partnership from near
   collapse to deepened commitments. While stretching frames heightens the
   risk of frame break, our analysis shows how such iterative ongoing
   efforts are essential for deepening commitments and advancing
   collaboration. We thus contribute to framing theory by highlighting how
   frame alignment can be achieved across multiple interaction arenas by
   ``collaborating on the edge of failure.{''} We further contribute to
   scholarship on multiparty collaboration by unpacking the multi-table
   negotiation dynamics that help explain collaborative outcomes.},

Abstract = {Capitalizing on massive sentiment diffusion and mobilization aided by
   mass media and social media nowadays, we introduce a general theory of
   host country sentiments to illuminate the granular, context-situated,
   and time dynamic power of social sentiments. We posit that host country
   is a value-laden context wherein a foreign entity's ` s strategic action
   stimulates host country stakeholders' ` social sentiments and engagement
   in systems of discourses ({''}sentiment `` sentiment arousal{''}), `` ),
   mobilizes social sentiments toward the foreign entity ({''}sentiment ``
   sentiment competence{''}), `` ), and legitimizes social sentiments and
   the strategic action of the foreign entity ({''}sentiment `` sentiment
   resonance{''}). `` ). To test our theory, we employ a context of inward
   acquisitions by emerging market firms in an advanced economy, and
   postulate that host country sentiments toward objects of the inward
   acquisition (deal, acquirer, and inward investments from home country)
   will influence the likelihood of deal completion, an indication of host
   country legitimacy. We further highlight the patterns of host country
   sentiment dynamics, and showcase how sentiment volatility, wavelength,
   and augmentation exert heterogeneous effects on deal completion.
   Overall, we advocate a theory of host country sentiments in
   international management research that elucidates the interplay among
   host country sentiments, systems of social discourses, and multinational
   enterprise strategic outcomes in a host country.},

Abstract = {Shteynberg's (Journal of Consumer Psychology, 2024) work on collective
   consciousness offers unique and meaningful insights into consumer
   behavior by emphasizing a ``we-representation{''} that is comprised not
   of a self-aware ``I{''} and an external ``you{''} but rather complete
   immersion as a unified ``we{''}. In this commentary, we situate
   collective consciousness within existing social presence research in
   consumer behavior and discuss its potential to expand the scope of
   social presence research. Specifically, we utilize a social presence
   framework that highlights the type of co-presence (in-person vs.
   virtual) and the extent of interactivity (interactive vs. passive)
   discussing the psychological mechanisms and linkage to collective
   consciousness. In addition to discussing shared consumption and shared
   decision-making, we assess the implications of collective consciousness
   for consumer contexts facilitated by virtual technologies: fake news,
   live streaming, virtual reality, cryptocurrencies, and crowdfunding. We
   conclude by highlighting future avenues for integrating collective
   consciousness into consumer psychology research.},

   1880-1905},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT STUDIES},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 JUL 30},
Abstract = {We draw on the historical case of the UK pharmacy industry from
   1880-1905 to examine how, in the face of a competitive threat to their
   survival, lower status professionals seek to reinvigorate the memory of
   their role in providing community service in the public interest.
   Derived from this, our study reveals how mnemonic work has a nuanced
   nature in professionalized settings. First, lower status actors enact
   certain types of mnemonic work because they need to maintain
   professional purity. Second, to maintain professional purity, lower
   status professionals also need to carefully sequence their mnemonic work
   and pay particular attention to the social context within which they are
   seeking to manipulate collective memory. Our study also shows how,
   within such a sequencing, for lower status professionals to successfully
   enact mnemonic work, they need to collectively mobilize their ranks and
   may engage in entryism to professional bodies dominated by their higher
   status peers.},

Title = {Keeping the Iron Cage from Closing: How clashes over shared principles
   elicit collective authoring},
Journal = {ORGANIZATION STUDIES},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {45},
Number = {8},
Pages = {1161-1190},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {When less hierarchical organizations attempt to avoid positional
   authority and rely more on the authority of shared principles, they are
   challenged to balance a relative open-endedness and sufficient consensus
   of those principles. However, situations inevitably arise when
   assertions about the principles clash, disturbing the sense of
   collective sharing of principles and so triggering tendencies to make
   the principles more rigid or default to positional rule. This paper
   explores how internal collective dialogue unfolds in such situations in
   the central online channels of three mid-sized Nordic software
   consultancies aspiring for less hierarchical, principles-based
   organizing. Our research reveals the emergence of ``collective
   authoring{''}-peripheral participation that reacts to the distress
   stirred by the clash. The collective responds with tension-mediating
   remarks and, most markedly, with a polyphony of inquiries and musings
   that are attentive to what is unfolding but not stubbornly fortified
   with either side of the clash. We discover how this collective dialogue
   comes to embed the initial clash with the iteratively maturing and
   saturating soundscape of deliberations, gradually invoking a tacit sense
   of the collective understanding of the issue on the channels. The
   dialogues persist until the most acute sense of distress over the
   sharing of principles seems to dissolve. We discuss how our findings, by
   illuminating the role of ``the collective,{''} contribute to the extant
   conceptions of relational authority and less hierarchical organizing.},

Journal = {ORGANIZATION STUDIES},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {45},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {As a symptom of the current global climate emergency, rising
   temperatures pervade organizational lives. Yet organization studies have
   hardly investigated the everyday organizing necessary to cope and adapt,
   here and now, to life in a world approaching and even surpassing 50
   degrees C. This article seeks to open spaces of collective inquiry to
   grapple with practices of organizational co-evolution with heat. I apply
   Barad's post-humanist notion of diffraction-patterns of interference in
   entangled agency-through warming organizations, as rising temperatures
   intra-act with the matter, materials, bodies, and discourses that
   co-constitute them. Diffractive inquiry helps organization studies
   understand how rising heat alters and amplifies bodily differences
   across families, communities, firms, societies, and ecologies. This
   post-humanist view forces us to rethink theories of organizational
   resilience, inequality, and identity in co-evolution with heat and other
   ecological phenomena as part of a relational whole.},

Title = {Experimentation in Wicked Situations: How activists construct pragmatic
   action frames},
Journal = {ORGANIZATION STUDIES},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {45},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Experimentation is key in wicked situations; it provides small wins
   while keeping several options open for the future. The literature is,
   however, scarce on how experimentation is framed, a crucial aspect to
   the understanding of how actors identify and pursue experiments in
   situations that are constantly changing and lack a clear resolution. We
   address this gap by drawing on the concept of `action frames' and
   deploying a comparative case study of nine cases in diverse contexts in
   which activists experimented with wicked problems. We find that
   activists pragmatically shy away from pursuing a permanent solution to
   focus instead on achieving small wins, diagnosing `symptoms' rather than
   `root causes' of problems, and `working around' institutional
   constraints instead of directly `confronting' them. This pragmatic
   action frame prompts them to initiate pilot experiments that involve
   trial-and-error and collective learning, and that sometimes scaffold
   into cumulative small wins. Reflecting on our findings, we build a model
   of how pragmatic action frames fuel distributed possibilities to
   experiment in wicked situations. Our model contributes to the literature
   on wicked problems by revealing how activists `welcome' complexity
   instead of `taming' it. We contribute to the literature on action frames
   by demonstrating how multiple viable pragmatic action frames are
   constructed iteratively without threatening an alternative, dominant
   frame. Lastly, we contribute to the literature on robust action by
   demonstrating how pragmatic action frames pave the way for distributed
   experimentation and by unpacking the core attributes that make `robust
   actors' accepting of open-ended wayfinding journeys.},

Abstract = {We build on the construct of collective consciousness, which reflects a
   view that a person can see the self as the subject that is attending,
   experiencing, or acting as a unitary collective agent, that is, from the
   perspective of ``we{''} as opposed to ``I.{''} Shteynberg (Journal of
   Consumer Psychology, 2024) proposes that collective consciousness can
   foster mutual trust and cooperation, thus having positive implications
   for both individuals and society. In this commentary, we discuss what
   the construct of collective consciousness might have to offer consumer
   researchers by considering when collective consciousness could be
   relevant in consumer contexts, its key psychological consequences, and
   how this theory could potentially build upon and interact with existing
   frameworks in consumer psychology. In addition, we consider some
   potential negative consequences of collective consciousness and point to
   potentially fruitful directions for future consumer research.},

Title = {Conform and Oppose through Numbers: Quantifying Hybrid Organizations at
   the International Cooperative Alliance},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT STUDIES},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 JUL 14},
Abstract = {Collectives of hybrid organizations have emerged with the aim of
   promoting the plural goals and values embodied by their member
   organizations. Doing so, however, often requires simultaneous conformity
   and opposition to dominant institutional norms, such as those underlying
   mainstream market activity. We examine how hybrid collectives navigate
   this `conform-and-oppose' tension as they seek to promote their members'
   hybrid form through quantification - i.e., the use of numbers to label,
   count, and describe members. Analyzing the case of the International
   Cooperative Alliance, we identify four interrelated dimensions
   (valorization, validity, reactivity, and retroaction) through which a
   hybrid collective can harness quantification to manage differing
   commitments to market and social goals and values within and beyond the
   collective - a process we name formative quantification. Core to this
   process are two filtering mechanisms - validity searching and values
   queuing - through which a hybrid collective integrates stakeholder
   perceptions of truth (validity) and value (valorization) to navigate
   hybrid tensions. Our work extends theory on hybrid tension management to
   the inter-organizational level, while shifting the view of
   organizational quantification from a tool of conformity-enhancing
   evaluation towards a collective search for numbers that both conform to
   and oppose taken-for-granted norms.},

Abstract = {Organizations must excel at what they do well while also learning new
   ways of operating to achieve long-term success. Work teams may thus find
   themselves pursuing contradictory objectives to support the
   organization's strategy. We investigated teams' goal orientation
   (in)congruence and its impact on task meaningfulness and, ultimately,
   performance, hypothesizing the potential pitfalls of teams
   simultaneously pursuing both learning- and performance-goal
   orientations. Three-wave, multisource data were collected from 109 teams
   at a large North American mortgage company. In a polynomial regression
   and response surface analytical framework, team task meaningfulness-and
   subsequent team performance-was enhanced when teams had greater
   divergence between their learning- and performance-goal orientations but
   suffered when both goal orientations were more aligned. Our
   investigation thus revealed the potential pitfalls of teams
   simultaneously pursuing both learning- and performance-goal
   orientations. We discuss the theoretical contributions of the team goal
   orientation incongruence effect substantiated in this study, as well as
   implications for practice and future research.},

Title = {Resisting Financial Consumer Responsibilization Through Community
   Counter-Conduct},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ETHICS},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 JUL 2},
Abstract = {This paper investigates Street Fight Radio's consumer community's
   resistance to neoliberal financial consumer responsibilization. Extant
   scholarship critiques consumer responsibilization on ethical grounds for
   placing too much responsibility on consumers at the expense of
   institutional actors. It also describes some forms of aversion to parts
   of the responsibilization process among individuals and short-lived
   consumer collectives. However, it falls short of analyzing
   community-driven resistance to financial consumer responsibilization
   writ large, or consumers' efforts to responsibilize other stakeholders.
   Our netnographic and ethnographic study of Street Fight Radio (SFR), a
   populist grassroots political comedy radio show and podcast with a
   strong anti-neoliberal consumer community, addresses these previous
   theoretical limitations. Drawing from Foucault's counter-conduct
   concept, we show how SFR's consumer community bolsters and sustains
   community-level resistance to financial consumer responsibilization. It
   encourages consumers to push for collective protections from markets and
   responsibilize other actors to address systemic, structural precarity.
   Our analysis makes novel contributions by theorizing the role of
   community in sustaining resistance to consumer responsibilization and by
   demonstrating the role of precarious consumers' performative staging of
   supposedly excessive, irresponsible consumption in reorienting consumer
   ethics.},

Title = {Trump election and minority CEO pessimism},
Journal = {REVIEW OF ACCOUNTING STUDIES},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 JUL 1},
Abstract = {Ethnic tension in the United States became more salient after Donald
   Trump's election on November 9, 2016. Exploring the variation in
   management forecasts, we show that after the Trump election, minority
   CEOs exhibit more pessimism in their earnings forecasts (underestimation
   of the mean of earnings), compared with their non-minority counterparts.
   This tendency toward pessimism is observed across CEOs from various
   minority groups and is particularly pronounced in firms led by less
   experienced or less confident minority CEOs. Further analyses reveal
   that minority CEOs make less specific and less precise forecasts.
   Minority CEO pessimism is not explained by alternative explanations
   including terrorist attacks and minority CEOs' political ideology.
   Collectively, our research provides evidence that the Trump election
   induces biased beliefs in the form of pessimism in ethnic minority CEOs.},

Title = {Toward health promotion and prevention: Evidence from a food and health

Journal = {JOURNAL OF OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {70},
Number = {6},
Pages = {1007-1038},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Health promotion and disease prevention requires health systems address
   the patients' social needs using new care delivery models. Yet, research
   in this area has stalled for several reasons. We study a partnership
   model of care that couples clinical care delivered by primary care
   providers and social services delivered by community-based
   organizations, and its impact on patients' preventive health outcomes
   and behaviors. We use data from the Mid-Ohio Farmacy, which is a
   collaboration across the Mid-Ohio Food Collective (MOFC), a network of
   650+ affiliated food pantries, and a large federally qualified health
   center (FQHC). The FQHC offers primary and preventative healthcare
   services across eight free clinics, which are co-located with the
   MOFC-affiliated food pantries. Patients were screened for food
   insecurity during their clinic visit and, if positive, were referred to
   the Farmacy. Compliers made at least one visit to the food pantry after
   referral, while noncompliers did not. Using difference-in-differences,
   we find that compliers had no discernible change in their body mass
   index (BMI, kg/m2), which we refer to as a BMI stabilization effect.
   Noncompliers' BMI increased after referral. High comorbid and high
   pantry use compliers experienced a significant reduction in their BMI
   and a marginally significant reduction in glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c,
   \%). These patients had unique compliance behaviors, including greater
   search, frequency, and consistency of food pantry use. Travel costs
   suggests that high comorbid patients ascribed a greater value to the
   Farmacy program. In terms of primary care utilization, we find that
   compliers' clinic visit patterns after referral were consistent with the
   visit patterns observed in the food secure cohort, suggesting that the
   Farmacy program may have helped compliers address competing demands that
   are known to inhibit health behaviors.
   The food and health partnership model of care helps stabilize patient
   health outcomes, curbing the progressive risk of chronic conditions like
   obesity, hypertension, and diabetes. Patients with co-morbid conditions
   had greater search, frequency, and consistency of food pantry use after
   referral, suggesting that these patients were more likely to use ``food
   as medicine.{''} In terms of primary care utilization, food insecure
   compliers' clinic visit patterns after referral were consistent with the
   visit patterns observed in the food secure cohort, suggesting that the
   partnership model helps compliers address competing demands that inhibit
   health behaviors.},

   perspective on risk attitudes toward time, as well as on the aggregation
   of multiple discount factors. We also offer a novel class of
   non-expected utility preferences over gambles which satisfy invariance
   to background risk as well as betweenness, but are versatile enough to
   capture mixed risk attitudes.},

Title = {Cultural tightness in organizations: Investigating the impact of formal
   and informal cultural tightness on employee creativity},
Journal = {ORGANIZATIONAL BEHAVIOR AND HUMAN DECISION PROCESSES},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {184},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {This paper delineates cultural tightness into formal versus informal
   aspects to depict the strength of norms and the extent of sanctions
   emanating from both formal and informal norms. Organizations with high
   formal cultural tightness regulate behaviors through explicit written
   norms and official sanctions, whereas those with high informal cultural
   tightness regulate behaviors through uncodified norms, collective
   beliefs, and informal social sanctions. Through a field study across 14
   diverse companies in two countries (Malaysia and the Philippines) and
   two experiments involving participants from the United States, we found
   that perceived informal cultural tightness consistently exerts a more
   significant impact on stifling employee creativity than perceived formal
   cultural tightness. Additionally, we discovered that these two aspects
   of cultural tightness also potentially interact to influence employee
   creativity. Lastly, we identified promotion-focused (but not
   prevention-focused) self-regulation as a likely mechanism through which
   informal cultural tightness affects employee creativity. These findings
   contribute to cultural tightness-looseness theory and research on how
   organizational culture affects employee creativity.},

Title = {From Audience to Evaluator: When Visibility into Prior Evaluations Leads
   to Convergence or Divergence in Subsequent Evaluations Among
   Professionals},
Journal = {ORGANIZATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {35},
Number = {5},
Pages = {1682-1703},
Month = {SEP-OCT},
Abstract = {Collective evaluation processes, which offer individuals an opportunity
   to assess quality, have transcended mainstream sectors (e.g., books,
   restaurants) to permeate professional contexts from within and across
   organizations to the gig economy. This paper introduces a theoretical
   framework to understand how evaluators' visibility into prior
   evaluations influences the subsequent evaluation process: the likelihood
   of evaluating at all and the value of the evaluations that end up being
   submitted. Central to this discussion are the conditions under which
   evaluations converge-are more similar to prior evaluations-or
   diverge-are less similar-as well as the mechanisms driving observed
   outcomes. Using a quasinatural experiment on a platform where investment
   professionals submit and evaluate investment recommendations, I compare
   evaluations that are made with and without the possibility of prior
   ratings influencing the subsequent evaluation process. I find that when
   prior ratings are visible, convergence occurs. The visibility of prior
   evaluations decreases the likelihood that a subsequent evaluation occurs
   by about 50\%, and subsequent evaluations become 54\%-63\% closer to the
   visible rating. Further analysis suggests that peer deference is a
   dominant mechanism driving convergence, and only professionals with
   specialized expertise resist peer deference. Notably, there is no
   evidence that initial ratings are related to long-term performance.
   Thus, in this context, convergence distorts the available quality signal
   for a recommendation. These findings underscore how the structure of
   evaluation processes can perpetuate initial stratification, even among
   professionals with baseline levels of expertise.},

Title = {Enacting Decentralized Authority: The Practices and Limits of Moving
   Beyond Hierarchy},
Journal = {ADMINISTRATIVE SCIENCE QUARTERLY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {69},
Number = {3},
Pages = {791-833},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Decentralization as an organizing principle has drawn growing interest
   from scholars and practitioners because of its perceived suitability for
   contemporary market conditions and alignment with employees' evolving
   work expectations. However, efforts to decentralize authority face
   significant obstacles and often end in failure. I propose that existing
   research on decentralization has struggled to generate insight into how
   such barriers can be overcome because it has treated decentralization as
   a static outcome imposed by organizational designers. In contrast, this
   article treats decentralization as a dynamic and situated achievement
   that must be continually enacted, and it leverages ethnographic data
   from a decentralization effort in order to build theory on the
   organizational practices that support enactments of decentralized
   authority. I find that successful enactments of decentralized authority
   were supported by practices that established clear boundaries of
   authority and focused collective attention on these boundaries, as well
   as by practices that depersonalized collective attributions of the
   source of authority. At the same time, the practices were difficult to
   sustain because they were cognitively, emotionally, and temporally
   demanding. Through this study, I show that decentralization is not
   merely a one-time structural change but an ongoing collective process
   that requires navigating and neutralizing the structural and
   psychological forces pulling organizations back toward hierarchy.},

Title = {The Co-Production of Service: Modeling Services in Contact Centers Using
   Hawkes Processes},
Journal = {MANAGEMENT SCIENCE},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 JUN 11},
Abstract = {In customer support contact centers, every service interaction involves
   a messaging dialogue between a customer and an agent; together, they
   exchange information, solve problems, and collectively co -produce the
   service. Because the service progression is shaped by the history of
   conversation thus far, we propose a bivariate marked Hawkes process
   cluster model of the customer -agent interaction. To evaluate our
   stochastic model of service, we apply it to an industry contact center
   data set containing nearly 5 million messages. Through both a novel
   residual analysis comparison and several Monte Carlo goodness -offit
   tests, we show that the Hawkes cluster model indeed captures dynamics at
   the heart of the service and surpasses classic models that do not
   incorporate the service history. Furthermore, in an entirely data
   -driven simulation, we demonstrate how this history -dependent model can
   be leveraged operationally to inform a prediction -based routing policy.
   We show that widely used and well -studied customer routing policies can
   be outperformed with simple modifications according to the Hawkes model.
   Through analysis of a stylized model proposed in the contact center
   literature, we prove that service heterogeneity can cause this
   underperformance and, moreover, that such heterogeneity will occur if
   service closures are not carefully managed.},

Title = {CEO gender and responses to shareholder activism},
Journal = {CONTEMPORARY ACCOUNTING RESEARCH},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {41},
Number = {3},
Pages = {1726-1753},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Recent literature finds that firms led by female CEOs are more likely to
   be targeted by activist shareholders and that female CEOs are more
   likely to cooperate with activist shareholders' requests. Our study
   complements this literature by using two controlled experiments and a
   series of semi-structured interviews with CEOs and CFOs to investigate
   how a CEO's response to shareholder activism influences investors'
   reactions and whether these reactions differ depending on the gender of
   the CEO or on how their response is explained. In the first experiment,
   we find that investors evaluate a firm as less attractive when a female
   CEO uses an uncooperative response rather than a cooperative response to
   shareholder activism, absent any explanation for the CEO's response.
   Conversely, investors evaluate a firm as less attractive when a male CEO
   uses a cooperative response rather than an uncooperative response. In
   the second experiment, where there is an added explanation for the CEO
   response, we find that investors react more positively to a female CEO's
   uncooperative response when the explanation is more communal (vs.
   agentic). Our interviews with CEOs and CFOs provide insights into how
   the gender of firms' leadership may play a role when activist
   shareholders target firms. Our results collectively suggest that
   investors rely on gender stereotypes when evaluating the responses of
   male and female executives to shareholder activism and that these
   evaluations affect their investment judgments. Our results also suggest
   a potential alternative explanation for the finding that female CEOs are
   more likely to cooperate with activist shareholders than are male CEOs.
   Rather than inherent differences in the management styles of male and
   female CEOs, responses to activist shareholders may be driven, at least
   in part, by managers anticipating that they will be penalized by
   investors for deviating from gender-stereotypical behavior.},

Title = {Political incentives and analyst bias: Evidence from China},

Volume = {41},
Number = {3},
Pages = {1695-1725},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {This study extends extant research on the determinants of financial
   analyst bias by examining the role that political incentives play. Using
   a series of scheduled provincial political events in China, we document
   that analysts are significantly more likely to issue favorable
   recommendations or revise their recommendations upward during political
   event periods, and the effect of political events on optimism is larger
   for analysts employed by brokerage firms affiliated with politicians.
   Cross-sectional evidence suggests that the impact of political events on
   analyst optimism is concentrated in those provinces where capital market
   development is a more important performance indicator for politicians or
   where the incumbent politicians face a pending promotion. Stock return
   analyses reveal that favorable recommendations issued during political
   event periods are significantly less profitable in the long run and are
   less credible according to investor perceptions. Reinforcing our main
   evidence, we also find that financial analysts are more likely to issue
   optimistic earnings forecasts during political event periods.
   Collectively, our results imply that political incentives distort
   analyst opinions and political-economic factors affect the corporate
   information environment in China.

Abstract = {Multinational corporations and their global suppliers are increasingly
   expected to employ sustainability practices throughout their supply
   chains. As such, the global scope of corporate sustainability -
   including the notion of `full-chain responsibility' - is a concern for
   firms, governments, NGOs, and other stakeholders. We evaluate the
   state-of-the-art of sustainability research on multinational firms and
   global supply chains, bringing together insights from two literatures
   that have examined this topic: international business and supply chain
   management. The articles in the Special Issue advance the research
   frontier by highlighting both macro impacts of legal and societal
   pressures as well as micro-processes of bargaining power, managerial
   sensemaking, and transparency to inform the relationships between global
   firms and their suppliers. Collectively, the research included in this
   Special Issue reflects a notable shift in focus from the former (macro)
   to the latter (micro). We elaborate on the benefits of incorporating
   additional notions such as power, opportunism, and negotiation in global
   supply chain research against the background of cross-country variation
   in legal and societal pressures. This would allow a more in-depth
   understanding of the dynamic relationships between multinational
   corporations, their multi-tier supplier networks, and other stakeholders
   that jointly shape the sustainability agenda.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we examine how field settlements are formed over time by
   zooming in on the actions and reactions of field incumbents as they seek
   to make sense of and collectively respond to external pressures for
   change in their field. We illustrate this process through an in-depth
   case study of the staff and members of an international industry
   association as they attempted to deal with pressures to change current
   industry practices relating to water and climate change. Specifically,
   we show how field settlements that change a field's ``rules of the
   game{''} are constituted by the sequential and cumulative layering of
   increasingly committing interim agreements between incumbents (which we
   refer to as microsettlements), themselves facilitated or impeded by
   practices that help calibrate tension levels between them. Our process
   model of microsettlement outcomes and trajectories contributes to extant
   research by theorizing how the inner workings of field-configuring
   organizations and the composition and structure of field settlements
   shape field (re)formation processes, thereby illuminating new pathways
   of action for organizations seeking to tackle societal grand challenges
   in creative, substantive, and meaningful ways.},

Abstract = {Racial injustice in employment demands the attention of business
   organizations because it profoundly shapes our life prospects. While
   comparing the ideal of perfectly equal opportunity with its invariably
   imperfect alternatives can impede reform, the true challenge lies in
   addressing persistent inequities as we strive for equality. This article
   introduces ``shared inequity{''} as a frame of reference for assessing
   workplace racial disparities and emphasizing a collective responsibility
   to remedy systemic issues. In critiquing an exaggerated notion of
   meritocracy, I emphasize that structural racism, rather than just
   individual acts, facilitates collective advantages, especially for White
   males. Hence, it is morally fitting to frame racial justice in
   employment, not only in terms of perfect equality, but also in terms of
   justly sharing an imbalance that cannot be corrected without
   counterbalance. The ``shared inequity{''} lens offers a more realistic
   and just approach to pursuing racial justice in the workplace.},

Title = {Stars in Their Constellations: Great Person or Great Team?},
Journal = {MANAGEMENT SCIENCE},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 MAY 30},
Abstract = {Although much attention is accorded to star performers, this paper
   considers the extent to which stars, themselves, benefit from the
   contribution of their collaborators (the constellation). By considering
   stars, constellations, and the synergies between them, we address a key
   question: To what extent is collaboration performance driven by the
   great individual or by great constellations? We introduce a novel
   approach that uses a matching model to uncover the complementarities
   driving collaboration formation. We use formal value-capture theory to
   estimate the relative contribution of stars and constellations to joint
   value creation. Analyzing a sample of academic research collaborations,
   we document that stars' relative contribution exceeds that of their
   constellations in less than 15\% of collaborations, although
   constellations provide a greater relative contribution in 9\%. In most
   collaborations, neither party dominates: Innovation is a collective
   endeavor driven equally by the star and the constellation. Joint value
   creation and relative contribution are explained by the subtle interplay
   between complementarities in joint work and the substitutability of
   collaborative parties in the market. Joint value creation increases with
   the strength of complementarities between parties in a match. Relative
   value creation, and hence dominance, increases with the substitutability
   of one's collaborative partner. Interestingly, joint value creation is
   greatest in collaborations where both stars and constellations offer
   bundles of rare attributes and where neither the star nor the
   constellation dominates.},

Abstract = {Multinational enterprises (MNEs) are increasingly called upon to address
   sustainability issues along their supply chains. We advance prior
   literature on this topic by building on the argument that comprehending
   individual-level sensemaking is the foundational step for understanding
   the design and execution of corporate sustainability strategy. Hence, we
   undertook a qualitative study of one European agri-food MNE and captured
   how internal and external stakeholders along two entire supply chain
   segments, reaching into India and Ethiopia, respectively, make sense of
   farmer livelihoods as one particular sustainability issue. Using Weick's
   stages of sensemaking as our theoretical lens, we find a high degree of
   diversity in interpretations regarding (1) the nature of the
   sustainability challenge, (2) the MNE's motives for addressing it, and
   (3) the potential solutions to it. However, consistent patterns emerge
   for the three sensemaking stages in relation to the individual's
   position in the supply chain. As a result of our analysis, we develop a
   conceptual model that elucidates differences in sensemaking of
   sustainability challenges by actors at different positions along global
   supply chains. Building on our findings, we offer a detailed explanation
   of how individual sensemaking influences collective sensemaking and, in
   turn, the direction and effectiveness of corporate strategy on
   sustainability.},

Title = {How research agendas are framed: Insights for leadership, learning and
   spillover in science teams},
Journal = {RESEARCH POLICY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {53},
Number = {7},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Research agendas in science are fundamentally important to the
   generation of new knowledge and innovation. Yet, there remains a lack of
   scholarly attention and poor understanding on how science teams engage
   with research agendas in ways that influence their development. New
   insights are needed to better understand the factors that contribute to
   research agenda development and adaptation. In this paper, we draw on
   the framing perspective to explore how research agendas are framed in
   science teams over time. Research agendas can be understood as
   collective action frames within science teams that mobilize, guide, and
   coordinate the transformation of innovative but abstract science
   aspirations into something more concrete. Our research utilises a
   longitudinal case study analysis of two science teams over seven years
   (2016-2022). Our findings provide several new insights. First, we detail
   two ways in which research agendas are framed. Through centralised
   framing, research agendas are embodied and dictated by a visionary
   science team leader. In contrast, through decentralised framing, team
   leadership is weakly enacted and multiple team members discuss and
   deliberate the composition and direction of the research agenda. Second,
   we show centralised and decentralised approaches to framing enable and
   constrain the reframing and transformation of research agendas. Third,
   we demonstrate centralised and decentralised framing of research agendas
   are respectively stabilised by passive and active team learning
   environments across three areas: research agenda responsibility and
   accountability, nature of autonomy, and leadership development pathways.
   Finally, we theorise that, to enhance spillover, leaders who centralise
   framing of the research agenda need to balance between the benefits of
   reframing efficiency, and enabling greater team interaction and
   opportunities for S\&T human capital development. On the other hand,
   when framing of research agendas is decentralised, team leaders need to
   balance between the benefits of team collaboration and leader
   development, and path dependent decision making. These insights lead to
   propositions that offer implications for theory and practice.},

Title = {Universal banking powers and liquidity creation},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS STUDIES},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {55},
Number = {6},
Pages = {764-781},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Universal banking powers are permissions for a nation's banks to provide
   financial services beyond ``plain vanilla{''} banking activities. Some
   nations restrict banking activities to only services such as loans and
   deposits, while others permit commercial banks to also engage in
   investment banking, insurance underwriting, and/or real estate
   investment activities. Despite the research and policy importance of
   this issue, the literature essentially neglects how these powers affect
   the primary role of banks in creating liquidity for society. We
   formulate two competing hypotheses as to whether more universal banking
   powers increase versus decrease domestic bank liquidity creation based
   on theories of risk absorption, relationship banking, and scope
   economies/diseconomies. We test which hypothesis empirically dominates
   using data from 85 nations over 15 years. The data strongly support the
   hypothesis that universal powers boost domestic bank liquidity creation.
   These findings are robust to addressing endogeneity, controlling for
   bank regulations, macroeconomic conditions, and institutional variables,
   and conducting subsample analyses. We also test for international
   arbitrage - whether the foreign subsidiaries of banks from more
   restrictive countries create more liquidity in host countries with fewer
   restrictions - and find support for this arbitrage. Collectively, these
   results provide important research and policy implications.},

   Membership in a DJ Community},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT STUDIES},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 MAY 21},
Abstract = {We show how technology and its temporal instantiations act as
   material-relational mnemonic devices that provide temporal anchors for
   collective remembering in occupations and form the basis of what we call
   an `occupational mnemonic community'. This is important because how the
   past is remembered shapes politics, the definition of membership and
   boundaries within occupations. Empirically, we focus on the occupation
   of DJing, an occupation that has witnessed major technological
   transformation. Utilizing interviews, archival research, and
   auto-ethnographic data, we show how DJs' engagement with material
   mnemonic devices, here, DJing technology, aligns group members'
   interpretations of the past, and forms the basis of an `occupational
   mnemonic community'. In our analysis, we uncover that imagined
   perceptions regarding how existing group members assess the material
   choices of newcomers, as well as, the performative behaviours exhibiting
   these choices, play pivotal roles in sustaining mnemonic communities. We
   conclude with a discussion on occupational mnemonic processes and their
   effect on establishing boundaries within occupations. Our findings
   contribute to a deeper understanding of the sociomaterial aspects of
   collective memory and its significance in understanding the politics of
   memory in work communities and organizations.},

Journal = {HUMAN RELATIONS},

Volume = {77},

Abstract = {Through a collaborative ethnography told through narratives and a
   counter-map drawn from Mapuche ontology, we determine how corporate
   social responsibility (CSR) simultaneously fractures and strengthens the
   collective identity of an Indigenous community through the mechanism of
   community benefit sharing. This study reveals how a young Mapuche
   Indigenous leader, Sim \& oacute;n, and his allies underwent the
   re-rooting and resurgence of their ancestral identity while resisting
   the construction of a hydropower project and the company's CSR, as well
   as their neighbours who supported the project. This study also discusses
   the emergence of repoliticized spirituality because of the collective
   identity work dynamics. We propose that this form of spirituality is
   particularly salient within groups whose ancestors endured colonization.
   This phenomenon unfolds through a sequence of mechanisms, including
   collectively reaching breaking points catalysed by external threats
   (e.g. large-scale projects) that prompt group self-reflection regarding
   their identity and history. Subsequently, Indigenous communities
   mobilize to safeguard their ancestral ontologies and spirituality. This,
   we assert, is a political act. We conclude by reflecting on the social
   responsibilities of businesses when interacting with Indigenous
   communities and territories. Managers and policymakers need to
   comprehend the potential impact of CSR initiatives on the intricate
   fabric of Indigenous identities.},

   lenient state-level misconduct enforcement. Collectively, my findings

   subsidies: nonfinancial misconduct that potentially could impact the

   Connection Between Ethical Climate Perceptions and Ethical Behavior},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ETHICS},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 MAY 16},
Abstract = {Workplace ethics perceptions drive ethical behaviors, but our
   understanding of how context shapes the nature of this relationship is
   limited. Consequently, this article uses contingency theory to explore
   how perceptions of ethical priorities in the workplace-ethical work
   climate (EWC)-are differentially associated with ethical behavior based
   on the broader context. Specifically, we meta-analytically test
   theoretically relevant cultural values (i.e., collectivism, power
   distance) and work context factors (i.e., consequence of errors, job
   autonomy) as moderators of the connection between EWC perceptions and
   ethical behavior. Our findings reveal that while higher power-distance
   societal contexts strengthen the connection between EWC perceptions and
   ethical behavior, work contexts with higher autonomy weaken the
   connection. We found mixed support for collectivism as a contextual
   moderator, with results supporting theoretical expectations with one
   cultural conceptualization but not another. Contrary to expectations,
   the consequences of errors in work contexts did not moderate the
   association between EWC perceptions and ethical behavior. Taken
   together, this meta-analytic investigation highlights the meaningful
   role of the broader organizational context as a potential boundary
   condition for the influence of EWC perceptions on ethical behavior.},

Title = {Tech-Enabled Financial Data Access, Retail Investors, and Gambling-Like
   Behavior in the Stock Market},
Journal = {MANAGEMENT SCIENCE},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 MAY 16},
Abstract = {Advancements in technology have reduced information acquisition costs,
   creating an improved information environment for retail investors.
   Specifically, new technologies, such as application programming
   interface (API), deliver high -volume, institutionallike raw data
   directly to Main Street investors. Although greater availability of
   information can be beneficial, it may also exacerbate retail investors'
   existing trading deficiencies. Exploiting the sudden shutdown of Yahoo!
   Finance API, the largest free API for retail investors, this study
   examines how access to tech -enabled raw financial data affects retail
   investment. We find that retail trading volumes in stocks favored by
   active retail investors dropped by 8.6\%-10.5\% within one month of the
   API shutdown. The remaining retail trades collectively became more
   predictive of future returns, suggesting less gambling -like behavior
   after the API shutdown. Moreover, our randomized controlled experiment
   affirms the underlying mechanism: tech -enabled access to high -volume
   historical price data increases individuals' overconfidence, which
   further leads them to engage in excessive trading. The study reveals an
   unintended consequence of technology -led, wider data access for retail
   investors.},

Title = {The Ethics of Commons Organizing: A Critical Reading},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ETHICS},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 MAY 13},
Abstract = {In this article, we seek to explore the different normative claims made
   around commons organizing and how the advent of the digital commons
   introduces new ethical questions. We do so by unpacking and categorizing
   the specific ethical dimensions that differentiate the commons from
   other forms of organizing and by discussing them in the light of debates
   around the governance of participative organizations, the cornerstone of
   commons organizing (Ostrom in Governing the commons: the evolution of
   institutions for collective action. Cambridge University Press,
   Cambridge, 1990). Rather than contesting commons organizing or endorsing
   it blindly, our goal is to critically reflect on its deontological and
   instrumental assumptions, and analyze the arguments upholding that it
   possesses ethical qualities that render it fairer, more equitable and
   sustainable than other centralized or hierarchical models-as well as any
   forms of privatization. We conclude by assessing the definitional
   dislocation of the digital commons where, unlike traditional commons,
   extractability can be endless and generate unintended consequences such
   as commodification or alienation. Taking stock of recent debates around
   the digital commons, we open the debate for future possible research
   avenues on normative claims, particularly under rapidly changing
   technological conditions.},

Title = {Do we Need a `New Strategy Paradigm'? No},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT STUDIES},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 MAY 7},
Abstract = {Bansal et al. `s Point piece, ``Strategy's Ecological Fallacy: How
   strategy scholars have contributed to the ecological crisis and what we
   can do about it,{''} call for reforming the strategy field to focus on
   the natural environment, ecological cycles, and interconnections across
   natural and social levels, in service of value creation for `a defined
   ecosystem that comprises respect for the natural environment'. We doubt
   that such new foundations are necessary or useful. We argue that Bansal
   et al. misconstrue the evolution and content of strategy thinking;
   downplay the usefulness of existing tools for dealing with their issues
   of concern; overlook problems of measurement, collective action,
   government failure, and cronyism encouraged by their preferred policies;
   embrace an unnecessarily alarmist worldview; and underappreciate the
   social benefits of the market-based institutions they criticize. We
   suggest instead that a market system based on clearly delineated
   property rights, prices that freely adjust to reflect scarcities, and an
   institutional environment that encourages entrepreneurship and
   innovation remains an underappreciated instrument for protection of the
   natural environment, one that is superior to centralized and regulatory
   alternatives.},

   This process also shifted the domains in which their religious and
   collectivist social identities were salient and helped to explain the
   emergence of important and contested changes in social and economic

Title = {Redefining Academic Safe Space for Responsible Management Education},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ETHICS},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 MAY 3},
Abstract = {In a time of increasing polarization, how can we address sensitive
   topics and ensure that university classrooms remain places of healthy
   discussions and ethical deliberations? This paper addresses this
   important question by drawing on unique qualitative data from our
   students' accounts of their experience in an organizational ethics
   course. We developed the course using a novel pedagogical strategy
   centered around the creation of an artistic portfolio. We find that
   student engagement in an alternative individual space, such as the
   artistic portfolio, supports them in developing (inter)personal skills
   in preparation for constructive participation in sensitive discussions
   and ethical deliberation in the classroom. Additionally, engagement with
   the artistic portfolio provides them with an alternative means for
   alleviating tension that arises from these discussions and a space for
   expressing their opinions. Our findings highlight the role of the
   portfolio as an individual safe haven that supports teachers in
   facilitating a positive classroom atmosphere and guides students through
   challenging discussions and deliberations intrinsic to responsible
   management education. Considering these new insights, we advocate for a
   shift from a collective to an individual perspective on safety in
   academia. This transition liberates the classroom from the constraints
   and limitations often associated with the establishment of collective
   safe spaces.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ETHICS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {195},
Number = {2},
Pages = {283-298},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Workers in the garment manufacturing industry are often subjected to
   violations of their rights and are exposed to low wages and difficult
   working conditions. In response to the exposure of these violations in
   the media, major fashion brands and retailers subject their suppliers to
   labour codes of conduct. Despite these codes of conduct being largely
   ineffective, this comparative case study of garment manufacturers
   operating from Lesotho and Eswatini illustrates that such codes provide
   workers and trade unions with access to bargaining leverage that they
   would otherwise not have. A framework with a synthesis of potential
   sources of workers' power is developed and related to global production
   networks, collective mobilisation, the nature of the state, as well as
   national and transnational scales of organising. Based on historical
   case studies of the two countries, this paper illustrates how unions in
   the two countries followed different approaches to using this source of
   power in relation to other sources of power. These approaches were
   shaped by their contexts and strategic choices. Theoretically, it is
   argued that sources of workers' power are analytically distinct, but are
   relational and operate best when seen as mutually reinforcing. The term
   `power resource nexus' is used to frame this potential mutual
   reinforcement of sources of power.},

Title = {Offsetable Derivatives and Investor Risk Assessment},
Journal = {MANAGEMENT SCIENCE},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {70},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) allows banks to
   offset derivative assets against derivative liabilities with the same
   counterparty and report only the net amount on the balance sheet.
   Derivative offsetting under international financial reporting standards
   (IFRS) is much more restrictive, resulting in the single largest
   differ-ence in balance sheet presentation between U.S. GAAP and IFRS.
   Two important factors dominate the standard-setting discussion on this
   issue: (1) whether these derivatives are informative about bank risk and
   (2) whether disclosing them substitutes for recognition on the balance
   sheet. Using a hand-collected global sample of banks, we first show that
   offse-table derivatives are positively associated with bank risk, based
   on multiple risk measures, suggesting that these derivatives are
   informative about bank risk. Next, exploiting the dif-ferential
   accounting treatment across U.S. GAAP and IFRS banks, we find that
   disclosure versus recognition of offsetable derivatives matters for the
   risk assessment of equity inves-tors but not for that of (more
   sophisticated) credit default swap investors. Additional tests
   corroborate the inference that investor sophistication helps explain the
   differential investor assessment of recognized versus disclosed
   offsetable derivatives. Collectively, our findings suggest that
   offsetable derivatives convey information about bank risk and that, for
   less sophisticated investors, disclosing them may not substitute for
   recognizing them},

Title = {Type Diversity of Institutional Investors and Opportunistic Acquisitions},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 APR 27},
Abstract = {Institutional investors of different types have been shown to exert
   differential influences on firm strategic decisions individually. Yet,
   research has largely overlooked how institutional investors of different
   types can collectively affect firm decision-making. This study
   investigates the legal type diversity of institutional ownership
   (hereafter ``investor type diversity{''}) and its influence on corporate
   acquisitions. Because institutional investors with different legal types
   have distinct interests and objectives, investor type diversity can
   create principal-principal conflicts and prevent institutional investors
   from undertaking coordinated actions, weakening their collective power
   and ability to play a governance role. We posit that investor type
   diversity will be positively associated with CEOs' opportunistic
   acquisitions because the dilution of shareholder governance, resulting
   from investor type diversity, grants CEOs the leeway to champion
   acquisitions aligned more with their personal gains. We also argue that
   the positive influence of investor type diversity on opportunistic
   acquisitions will be stronger when CEOs possess a higher level of
   general managerial ability. However, acquisitions pursued in the
   presence of higher investor type diversity will be associated with
   poorer performance. Findings from a sample of 2,106 U.S. firms lend
   support to our arguments. This study advances strategy research by
   highlighting the importance of investor type diversity in shaping
   shareholder governance effectiveness.},

   management research findings},
Journal = {RESEARCH POLICY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {53},
Number = {6},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Despite growing calls for a greater internationalization of management
   research, the discipline still struggles with the challenge of
   integrating diverse national contexts. While recent decades have seen a
   change toward a more equitable treatment of all national contexts, the
   belief that research conducted outside the United States is less
   generalizable remains strong. In this research note, we explore the
   general perceptions of what is considered a ``typical{''} study context
   by associating them with authors' variable tendencies to report threats
   to external validity. Using a sample of 400 papers from seven top-tier
   management journals, we find that research based on non-US data tends to
   report more external validity threats, which makes it appear less
   generalizable. While the belief that the US constitutes a ``typical{''}
   study context is shared by both US and non-US author teams, non-US
   coauthors tend to exhibit a relatively stronger bias against the
   generalizability of non-US samples in their studies. Collectively, our
   results contribute to the literature on external validity threats,
   generalizability, and biases in peer review, while also responding to
   recent calls for a more diverse and inclusive management research
   program.},

Title = {Invisible Iterations: How Formal and Informal Organization Shape
   Knowledge Networks for Coordination},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT STUDIES},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 APR 24},
Abstract = {This study takes a network approach to investigate coordination among
   knowledge workers as grounded in both formal and informal organization.
   We first derive hypotheses regarding patterns of knowledge-sharing
   relationships by which workers pass on and exchange tacit and codified
   knowledge within and across organizational hierarchies to address the
   challenges that underpin contemporary knowledge work. We use survey data
   and apply exponential random graph models to test our hypotheses. We
   then extend the quantitative network analysis with insights from
   qualitative interviews and demonstrate that the identified
   knowledge-sharing patterns are the micro-foundational traces of
   collective coordination resulting from two underlying coordination
   mechanisms which we label `invisible iterations' and `bringing in the
   big guns'. These mechanisms and, by extension, the associated
   knowledge-sharing patterns enable knowledge workers to perform in a
   setting that is characterized by complexity, uncertainty and ambiguity.
   Our research contributes to theory on the interplay between formal and
   informal organization for coordination by showing how self-directed,
   informal action is supported by the formal organizational hierarchy. In
   doing so, it also extends understanding of the role that hierarchy plays
   for knowledge-intensive work. Finally, it establishes the collective
   need to coordinate work as a previously overlooked driver of knowledge
   network relationships and network patterns.},

Title = {Beyond Reach but Within Sight: Ethical Leaders' Pursuit of Seemingly
   Unattainable Role Models in East Asia},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ETHICS},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 APR 24},
Abstract = {Inspired by Confucianism, Daoism, and Buddhism, many East Asian ethical
   leaders have aspired to emulate seemingly unattainable sages and buddhas
   throughout history. This aspiration challenges the common psychological
   view that significant gaps between role models and actual selves might
   hinder emulation motivation. It also differs from Western findings,
   which suggest that ethical leadership often emerges from emulating
   attainable exemplars like immediate supervisors or mentors. To decipher
   this intriguing emulation behavior in East Asia, this study employed a
   multiple-case approach involving 25 ethical leaders from Taiwan. Results
   indicate that these ethical leaders formulate three approaches to
   sustain emulation motivation for seemingly unattainable exemplars.
   First, they draw on East Asian philosophies to address demotivating
   factors such as ego threats and goal unattainability. Second, they
   embrace the cultural values of the Sinosphere, amplifying motivators
   like self-betterment, altruism, and life purpose. Lastly, they
   capitalize on the collective tendency of their culture to assimilate
   positive environmental influences, including societal norms and social
   support. These findings elucidate how and why many East Asian ethical
   leaders sustain buddha/sage emulation: The cultural resources of the
   Sinosphere nurture effective psychological strategies, underpinned by
   universal psychological mechanisms that suggest wider applicability
   across various societies.},

Title = {Social Systems as Moral Agents: A Systems Approach to Moral Agency in
   Business},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ETHICS},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 APR 24},
Abstract = {In the context of business, interactions between individuals generate
   social systems that emerge anywhere within a corporation or in its
   relations with external agents. These systems influence the behaviors of
   individuals and, as a result, the collective actions we usually
   attribute to corporations. Social systems thus make a difference in
   processes of action that are often morally evaluated by internal and
   external agents to the firm. Despite this relevance, social systems have
   not yet been the object of specific attention in the literature on moral
   agency in business. To fill this gap, I construct a theoretical
   framework based on Luhmann's ideas on social systems and morality. In
   particular, I argue that morality is a phenomenon that occurs in
   communication, and an agent can engage in morality in three different
   ways (as a moral factor, an expressive moral agent, or a reflective
   moral agent) depending on the functions it plays in communicative
   interactions. Based on this framework, I argue that social systems in
   business can be considered moral agents of those types.},

Journal = {ORGANIZATIONAL BEHAVIOR AND HUMAN DECISION PROCESSES},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {182},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Dominant group members have different reasons for identifying themselves
   as allies to marginalized groups. How might these reasons relate to
   allies' effectiveness? We use Schwartz's values theory to integrate
   disparate work, focusing on two values that can underlie allyship:
   self-transcendence, or enhancing the welfare of others, and
   selfenhancement, or personal status and esteem. Across three yoked
   experiments (N = 3016), we tested how values relate to allies'
   intentions, behavior, and persuasiveness. Phase A of each study sampled
   self-identified allies (e.g., towards LGBTQ+ people, Black people,
   women). Both self-transcendence and, less consistently, self-enhancement
   predicted increased activism intentions; only self-transcendence
   predicted petition-signing behavior. Phase B sampled new participants,
   who viewed advocacy statements generated by allies in Phase A. We found
   that ally values affected audience reactions: ally self-transcendence
   was associated with greater persuasiveness, while self-enhancement was
   associated with lower persuasiveness. Although both values can generate
   ally engagement, self-transcendence may promote greater ally
   effectiveness.},

   and leader effectiveness (k = 116, N = 42,487) to extend Judge et al.'s
   (2002) classic meta-analysis of Big Five personality and leadership. By
   testing novel hypotheses rooted in culturally endorsed implicit
   leadership theory and socioanalytic theory, we offer three unique
   insights. First, in collectivist societies (cultures that value
   interdependence with one's group), the five factor model traits-and
   leader Extraversion and Agreeableness in particular-are stronger
   predictors of leader effectiveness, consistent with the theorized need
   for enhanced social coordination in such cultures. Second, a theoretical
   model is proposed to specify that leader Big Five trait effects are
   mediated by leader behavior (confirming that Consideration mediates
   Extraversion and Agreeableness, whereas Initiating Structure mediates
   Conscientiousness, Extraversion, and Openness). Third, trait
   Honesty-Humility robustly predicts leader effectiveness beyond the Big
   Five traits, expanding the trait approach. New implications for
   understanding when and why personality traits predict leadership are

Abstract = {In creativity research, time is rarely conceptualized as a
   multidimensional phenomenon. Instead, it is conceived either as an
   external variable, for coordinating successive phases of an idea
   journey, interaction patterns, and moments of insight-or as an
   individual experience, encompassing aspects like stress or timelessness.
   Based on an ethnography of a music studio, I show how these
   temporalities coexist and how time is organized as a linear coordination
   process as well as an experience to enable and align individual and
   collective creativity. Time is thereby available in three dimensions, as
   planned time for linear sequencing of collective work steps, as assigned
   meantime for the spontaneous and parallel allocation of tasks to free
   time slots, and as idle meantime for indeterminate waiting periods
   afforded by the material temporality of artifacts and bodies. My
   findings elucidate that organizing the interplay of all three temporal
   dimensions favors both individual ideation in indeterminate situations
   of idleness and collective creative work on predefined tasks in planned
   phases and ad hoc structured situations. Importantly, I found how the
   time afforded by artifacts and bodies in creative work is key to
   enabling and aligning individual creative processes by providing
   opportunities for relaxation, defocusing, and humor during collective

Abstract = {I examine whether a strategic focus on data analytics is associated with
   improvements in firms' internal information quality. Using textual
   analysis of firm disclosures to identify a data analytics strategy, I
   first document that firm, leadership, and operating environment
   characteristics are all important determinants of the decision to adopt
   a data analytics strategy. I next use operating and financial reporting
   outcomes to infer whether a data analytics strategy improves internal
   information quality. I find that a data analytics strategy is associated
   with enhanced operating efficiency, as adopting firms invest and utilize
   existing resources more efficiently. I also find that a data analytics
   strategy is associated with more accurate management forecasts. These
   results, collectively, are consistent with a data analytics strategy
   improving firms' internal information quality. Lastly, I corroborate and
   extend my findings with job postings data, and the results suggest that
   firm leadership signals their support for data analytics initiatives
   through disclosure.
   Strategie d'analyse des donnees et qualite de l'information
   interneL'auteure de cette etude examine si l'orientation strategique
   axee sur l'analyse des donnees est associee a des ameliorations de la
   qualite de l'information interne des entreprises. Pour identifier une
   strategie d'analyse des donnees, l'auteure procede a une analyse
   textuelle des informations fournies par l'entreprise, montrant d'abord
   que les caracteristiques liees a l'entreprise, au leadership et a
   l'environnement operationnel sont des determinants importants de la
   decision d'adopter une strategie d'analyse des donnees. Ensuite, les
   resultats operationnels et des rapports financiers permettent a
   l'auteure de deduire si une strategie d'analyse de donnees ameliore la
   qualite de l'information interne. Les resultats indiquent qu'une
   strategie d'analyse des donnees est associee a une meilleure efficacite
   operationnelle, car les entreprises qui l'adoptent investissent et
   utilisent les ressources existantes de maniere plus efficace. De meme,
   une strategie d'analyse des donnees est associee a des previsions plus
   precises de la part de la direction. L'ensemble de ces resultats est
   coherent avec le fait qu'une strategie d'analyse des donnees ameliore la
   qualite de l'information interne des entreprises. Enfin, l'auteure
   corrobore et proroge ses conclusions a l'aide de donnees sur les offres
   d'emploi. Les conclusions de l'etude indiquent que les dirigeants de
   l'entreprise soutiennent les initiatives d'analyse des donnees par le
   biais des informations fournies.},

Abstract = {Multiperspective frameworks, such as the social relations model,
   socioanalytic theory, the realistic accuracy model, the self-other
   knowledge asymmetry model, and the trait-reputation-identity model, have
   advanced understanding of personality over the last 40 years. Due to a
   resurgence of interest in multiperspective research on personality and
   other constructs in organizational psychology, we conducted an
   integrative conceptual review of these specific multirater frameworks
   and their application in work settings. Our review identifies
   similarities and differences in these frameworks and suggests that they
   collectively represent an invaluable resource for personality
   researchers and the broader field of organizational psychology. Through
   our review, we distinguish multiperspective frameworks from similar
   approaches (e.g., multirater designs), track the evolution of these
   frameworks, and leverage current applications of these frameworks to
   craft a future research agenda. Our review serves as a roadmap to help
   scholars apply multiperspective logic more thoroughly and systematically
   in personality research and beyond. We close with a discussion of
   practical implications.},

Abstract = {Relationship-oriented human resource management (HRM) contributes to
   organizational functioning by promoting employee relationships,
   coordination, and cooperation. We propose unit-level positive affective
   climate as a motivational mechanism through which relationship-oriented
   HR systems can positively influence unit service quality and
   relationships with beneficiaries, and prevent individual emotional
   exhaustion. Moreover, we propose collective occupational calling serves
   as an alternative motivational source that can substitute for the
   positive effects of positive affective climate. In analyzing a sample
   composed of 742 nurses from 48 nursing units of two hospitals in China
   with data collection at three time points before and after the COVID-19
   outbreak, our results supported the substituting effects of unit-level
   collective occupational calling on positive affective climate stemmed
   from relationship-oriented HR systems. Our study connects strategic HRM
   and motivation research by shedding light on an affective mechanism from
   relationship-oriented HR systems and the contingencies involving
   employees' various sources of motivation, such as occupational calling.
   We further discuss theoretical and practical implications of the

Title = {Which Idea to Pursue? Gender Differences in Novelty Avoidance During
   Creative Idea Selection},
Journal = {ORGANIZATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {35},
Number = {6},
Pages = {2223-2248},
Month = {NOV-DEC},
Abstract = {Despite women having made significant progress in the modern workforce,
   gender gaps are still evident in creative work. In this paper, we
   propose that, although women and men are equally capable of generating
   creative ideas, gender differences emerge during the idea-selection
   stage. Specifically, compared with men, women engage in higher novelty
   avoidance during idea selection-the degree to which one selects an idea
   that is less novel than the most novel idea one has generated. In two
   laboratory studies and a field survey involving creative professionals,
   we found significant gender differences in novelty avoidance during idea
   selection and identified women's concerns about social backlash when
   pursuing highly novel ideas as one explanatory variable. We also
   experimentally manipulated gender compositions of the evaluation panel
   and found that women's novelty avoidance tendency during idea selection
   was reduced when they were informed about the presence of women
   evaluators. Finally, novelty avoidance during idea selection has an
   inverted U-shaped relationship with idea success; because women tend to
   engage in higher novelty avoidance than men, novelty avoidance in women
   (but not men) has a negative impact on the success of their ideas. By
   examining gender dynamics at specific stages, our work offers
   theoretical and practical insights regarding gender disparities in
   creative work.},

Title = {The Cumulative Effects of Marketized Care},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 APR 8},
Abstract = {Care is increasingly marketized. Previous marketing and consumer
   research has focused on specific tensions underlying marketized care
   provision and the ways in which consumers navigate them. In contrast,
   this conceptual article draws on interdisciplinary research on care to
   develop a cumulative understanding of marketized care, that is, based on
   those effects that build up over time when a critical mass of consumers
   routinely addresses care needs via markets. Defining marketized care as
   attending to the welfare needs of human and nonhuman others through the
   market, we identify four negative cumulative effects: individuating
   effects on consumer subjectivities, alienating effects on care
   relationships, responsibilizing effects on consumers as opposed to other
   institutional actors of care provision, and exploitative effects
   generated in global care and supply chains. We also outline four
   principles that can mitigate these effects: interdependent consumer
   autonomy, affective reconnections, proportionate responsibilization, and
   market reconfiguration. Our conceptualization moves the literature on
   marketized care forward by outlining its cumulative nature as well as
   offering potential solutions that are neither demonizing nor celebratory
   of markets. In doing so, we offer a series of generative insights for
   research on marketized care that contribute to addressing collective
   human and nonhuman flourishing.},

Title = {The Market Dynamics of Collective Ignorance and Spiraling Risk},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 APR 8},
Abstract = {In some markets, offerings become riskier over time as producers
   introduce new versions that are made more affordable by increasing their
   risk. Existing theories suggest consumers adopt riskier versions either
   because they become more risk tolerant or they trade higher risk for
   lower price-both of which presume consumers know the risks. We reveal a
   third explanation: evolving market dynamics that increasingly encourage
   consumer inattention to risk and produce ``collective ignorance.{''} We
   identify factors of collective inattention and propose a three-stage
   model of development of collective ignorance by analyzing the case of
   risk buildup in the Hungarian mortgage market. Data include archival
   materials and interviews with borrowers, lenders, and regulators.
   Initially, producers offer low-risk products, and social, cultural, and
   institutional factors encourage attention to risk. Consumers attentive
   to and capable of assessing risk become early adopters. Over time,
   increasing adoption and changes in market factors divert consumers'
   attention from risk, shifting it to price. Under insufficient
   regulation, risk escalates: producers repeatedly cut price by offering
   increasingly risky products, while rising collective ignorance leads
   even risk-averse consumers to adopt them. We offer theoretical
   contributions to research on the social construction of risk, the
   attitude-behavior gap, and neoliberal responsibilization.},

   Mechanisms, and Moderators of Perceived Overqualification},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 APR 5},
Abstract = {Perceived overqualification (POQ) has traditionally been seen as an
   undesirable employment situation associated with negative outcomes.
   However, recent research suggests that POQ may have positive
   implications for both employees and organizations. Despite the growing
   literature on this topic, scholars have offered numerous explanatory
   mechanisms for linking POQ with its work outcomes, and inconsistent
   findings have been reported, highlighting the need for a comprehensive
   understanding of why, where, and for whom POQ is beneficial or
   detrimental. In the present study, we developed an integrative
   theoretical framework that depicts the consequences, mechanisms, and
   moderators of POQ. We then conducted a meta-analytical review of the POQ
   literature, analyzing 704 effect sizes from 251 independent samples (N =
   87,229). By organizing the dominant mechanisms in POQ research within a
   unified framework of work motivation, we elucidate the distinct pathways
   by which POQ induces differential work consequences. We further consider
   the role of key cultural, economic, sociodemographic, and methodological
   characteristics as boundary conditions. Overall, our findings provide
   support for our predictions and provide novel insights into the
   work-related consequences of POQ. Theoretical and practical implications
   of our findings are thoroughly discussed.},

Abstract = {We have entered an era where, in addition to us humans, systems can also
   think. It is imperative to decide how decision rights and authorities
   are allocated and distributed across interconnected co-cognitors: things
   that think. To address this question vital to the redesign of
   organizations, we reconceptualize cognitive reapportionment as the
   dynamic reallocation of decision rights and authorities across human and
   system co-cognitors capable of independent decision making. We
   articulate the Helix Model of Decision Journeys, wherein decision
   journeys, comprised of decision elements allocable to human or system
   co-cognitors, interweave and integrate business processes. The dynamic
   reapportionment of cognitive responsibilities across co-cognitors is
   dependent upon the type of scientific reasoning-deduction, induction, or
   abduction-at each decision element. We further propose two intertwined
   mechanisms for the art of letting go that facilitate the adoption of the
   Helix model. First, the nexus of omnipresent system co-cognitors
   collectively needs to evoke trust. Only when Technology Trust Thresholds
   are exceeded can decision making be reorganized and control relinquished
   to system co-cognitors. Second, the world of omnipresent cognitors will
   compel us to redesign, reprogram, and remix our workflow and business
   processes. Only through a purposeful effort to Redesign in the Remix
   Regime can the deduction-induction-abduction nature of decision tasks
   serve as the basis for their reapportionment.},

Title = {Blessing or Curse? Implications of Data Brokers for Publisher
   Competition},
Journal = {INFORMATION SYSTEMS RESEARCH},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 APR 1},
Abstract = {The abundance of consumer data has given rise to a new data broker
   industry that plays a pivotal role in targeted advertising. Many
   publishers rely on data brokers to gain (i) individual insights drawn
   from their own data or (ii) collective insights drawn from both their
   data and those of their competitors, thus improving their targeting
   capabilities. As data brokers control large volumes of data, they can
   govern how data insights are sold to downstream publishers. Despite
   their importance, prior studies provide little insight into the
   strategic function of data brokers and their subsequent impact on
   downstream competition. To address this research gap, we build an
   analytical model to analyze the interactions among a data broker, two
   competing publishers, and advertisers. Our analysis yields several novel
   findings. First, we show that the data broker may strategically set
   prices in a manner that leads to the exclusive selling of collective
   insights to one publisher, as opposed to nonexclusive selling involving
   two publishers. This result implies that it may be advantageous for the
   data broker to pursue an exclusive strategy that makes data insights
   scarcer for some firms. Second, we illustrate that competition between
   publishers can be either facilitated or impeded by the data broker
   depending on the broker's interests when selling the data insights.
   Finally, the data broker may induce both competition -mitigation and
   value -enhancing effects that affect aggregate welfare. Interestingly,
   although the data broker's decision (i.e., exclusive selling) may reduce
   market competition, the aggregate welfare can still improve because
   collective insights allow publishers to increase their targeting value
   for advertisers more efficiently.},

Title = {Brand transgressions: How, when, and why home country bias backfires},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF THE ACADEMY OF MARKETING SCIENCE},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {52},
Number = {4},
Pages = {976-997},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Despite heightened interest in brand transgressions among academics and
   practitioners, the literature remains silent about the influence of a
   brand's origin on consumer responses to brand misconduct. This leaves
   managers unaware of how to adapt post-transgression recovery strategies
   at home and abroad. Contrary to the in-group country bias literature, we
   theorize an ``origin-backfire{''} effect: consumers forgive domestic
   brand transgressions less. Analyzing experimental, social media, and
   secondary-longitudinal data, we find that consumers treat domestic brand
   transgressors as home-country traitors deserving punishment. Social
   identity threats mediate this effect and consumer ethnocentrism
   attenuates it. Transgressions' damage on brand reputation and value is
   larger and takes longer to recover from in domestic markets. Managers
   can alleviate post-transgression backlash through communication framing
   that construes the transgression as a response to intergroup threats (in
   foreign markets) and through collective compensation strategies (in
   domestic markets). The findings reveal cross-national variability in
   transgressions' experience, impact, and recovery and inform
   post-transgression repair strategies.},

Title = {Memories lost: A history of accounting records as forms of projection},
Journal = {ACCOUNTING ORGANIZATIONS AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {112},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {This paper develops a theoretical history of the intricate relationship
   between accounting as a recording technology and memory, arguing that
   accounting's influence extends beyond mere financial documentation to
   shape human memory and projections into the past and the future. Drawing
   on Stiegler's theory of transindividuation, understood as the
   trans-formation of individuals, groups and technologies, and his
   emphasis on technologymediated memory, we propose that varying types of
   accounting records cultivate different memory forms by fostering
   spatiotemporal projections which reshape the societal perception and
   comprehension of accounting. Our analysis relies on a comparison between
   two decentralized transaction recording systems similar in their
   operations, but which emerged in two different eras: blockchain and
   early double-entry bookkeeping. Our approach draws from Haydu (1998) to
   identify similarities and contrasts between different periods which can
   emphasize the uniqueness of each, while conceptualizing long-term
   trends. By juxtaposing DEB and BC as instances of decentralized records,
   the study postulates a critical shift in accounting's transindividuation
   over time. We argue that while DEB's norms of recording aided in the
   formation of collective memory and long-term projections, turning
   records into objects of social investment, BC's recording, propelled by
   automation and an economic emphasis, manifests as an isolated numerical
   sequence hindering the scope of human projections. We posit that
   compared to early DEB, BC recording, although it holds the potential for
   democratization, may lead to divisions between users, among themselves,
   and with their records. We discuss the potential implications of this
   trans-dividuation process for notions of accountability, transparency,
   regulation, and the broader political role of accounting in society.},

Abstract = {This paper develops and tests a new conceptual model incorporating the
   indirect impact of two ethical ideologies (idealism and relativism) on
   Chinese consumers' ethical judgments under four ethically problematic
   consumption situations (active benefit, passive benefit, deceptive
   practice, and no/indirect harm) through two cultural values (integration
   and moral discipline). Data from a large-scale online consumer survey in
   five major Chinese cities (N = 1046) support most hypotheses. The
   findings are consistent with the postulated global impact of ethical
   ideology on forming an individual's beliefs and values and highlight the
   importance of a thorough understanding of the significant determinants
   of consumer ethics to promote ethically responsible consumption
   behaviors. This study also uses an emic approach to conceptualize and
   measure Chinese cultural values by using cultural constructs and
   measures that are designed explicitly in the Chinese context.},

Abstract = {This study sheds new insight on how historically oppressed and
   marginalized actors are able to pursue environmental sustainability
   based on alternative worldviews (e.g., Indigenous worldviews) rather
   than succumbing to those dominant in the Western society, based on a
   study of the Syilx ({''}Okanagan{''}) people in British Columbia,
   Canada. We found that the Syilx people enacted the ethical practice of
   N(sic)awqnwix(w) ({''}the reciprocal gentle dropping of thoughts, like
   water, into everyone's minds to address the issue at the centre of
   discussion and to reach collective consensus for action{''}), anchored
   in the Syilx worldview, to reconstruct the relationships between humans
   and nature. Two overlapping processes are involved: developing
   foundational principles for human-nature relations and carrying out
   reconstruction work. Ongoing enactment of N(sic)awqnwix(w) practice
   provided community-based agency, enabling the Syilx people to shift the
   conversation around environmental sustainability. From this, we discuss
   the theoretical potential of community-based agency for the study of
   environmental sustainability, and the role of Indigenous worldviews for
   (re)imagining human-nature ethics (and reorienting the theoretical lens
   of human-animal or human-plant ethics form a firm-centric focus to a
   community-oriented lens), and important implications for practitioners
   and policymakers in the field of environmental sustainability.},

Title = {Holding Foreign Insiders Accountable},
Journal = {MANAGEMENT SCIENCE},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {70},
Number = {7},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Whereas corporate insiders at U.S.-listed, U.S.-domiciled companies must
   disclose their stock sales electronically within two business days on
   Form 4, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) exempts
   insiders at U.S.-listed, foreign-domiciled companies from this
   requirement. Instead, these ``foreign insiders{''} report their sales on
   a paper form mail -filed with the SEC. Using a unique data set compiled
   from digitized versions of thousands of paper forms, we examine the
   stock sales of foreign insiders and compare their trading to that of
   their U.S. counterparts. Consistent with a lack of public scrutiny
   facilitating opportunism, we show that foreign insiders' stock sales are
   highly opportunistic and opportunistic trading is concentrated in
   companies that are domiciled in nonextradition countries beyond the
   reach of U.S. legal authorities: specifically, Russia and China. The
   average stock sale by foreign insiders affiliated with companies
   domiciled in these countries is more than four times larger than that of
   U.S. insiders and occurs prior to stock price declines of at least-18\%.
   In our sample, we estimate that insiders at these companies have traded
   to avoid losses of more than \$9 billion. Collectively, our results
   suggest that corporate insiders associated with Chinese and Russian
   companies listed on U.S. exchanges trade in a highly opportunistic and
   abusive manner. The SEC's decision to exempt these insiders from Form 4
   reporting requirements prevents much needed public scrutiny of their
   trading and, in turn, prevents market forces from disciplining their
   trading.},

Title = {Resilience Within Constraints: An Event Oriented Approach to Crisis
   Response},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 MAR 14},
Abstract = {Scholars have started unpacking how individuals, organizations, and
   communities interact to build a shared capacity for resilience. This
   research, however, has not yet examined how the institutional
   environment influences local responses to crises. This is an important
   omission since crises do not occur in a vacuum-decisions of actors, at
   one level, constrain or catalyze the resilience responses of communities
   and the individuals and organizations within them. Furthermore, research
   on resilience often assumes a relatively static nature of crises,
   without accounting for the need to revise responses over time. Using an
   original set of high frequency data on COVID-19 rates in the United
   States, we investigate the relationship between healthcare decision
   agency at the county level and the incidence of the pandemic as
   reflected in the number of COVID cases and death by county. Our results
   provide robust evidence that higher degrees of decision-making autonomy
   are associated with lower rates of COVID-19 cases and deaths. That is, a
   positive relationship exists between decision-making autonomy and higher
   capacities for resilience. We further show that this relationship is
   strengthened, the larger and more heterogeneous is the mix of healthcare
   organizations in a county, and the higher is the need for revising
   responses given the changing nature of the crisis. Our results emphasize
   the need for a system approach to the study of resilience, and suggest
   that, by enabling the customization of responses to local needs and
   resources, decision-making autonomy enhances the shared capacities for
   resilience.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF CONSUMER PSYCHOLOGY},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 MAR 12},
Abstract = {This paper conceptualizes the phenomenon of historizing the present,
   defined as emphasizing the historical significance of present events and
   treating the present from the perspective of history. The authors
   identify four modes of historizing the present (emphasizing that: (1)
   the present will shape history; (2) the present is a unique moment in
   history; (3) the present will be remembered in history; (4) the present
   echoes history) and demonstrate how historizing can be employed by
   marketers of for-profit and nonprofit organizations in a variety of
   contexts. The paper examines the psychological implications of
   appreciating the historical significance of the present and outlines a
   research agenda for studying the downstream behavioral consequences of
   historizing the present across diverse substantive consumer domains. It
   concludes with an examination of the broader societal implications of
   historizing the present as well as its implications for consumer
   well-being.},

Title = {Accountability and the postcolonial identity of Palestinian human rights
   NGO activists},
Journal = {ACCOUNTING ORGANIZATIONS AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {112},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {We incorporate conceptualisations around the accountable self into the
   NGO accountability literature to consider how NGO human rights activists
   make sense of their accountability in relation to their postcolonial
   identity. We conducted 21 semi-structured interviews with Palestinian
   activists working in Palestinian and Israeli NGOs defending human rights
   in Gaza. Our findings provide four original insights. First, the
   construction of their identity as ``postcolonial{''} considerably
   motivates our interviewees' work as human rights activists, but also
   creates conflicts with NGOs' humanitarian missions. Activists respond by
   stressing their postcolonial identity over their professional one.
   Second, due to Palestinian activists' own lived experiences, they
   construct accountability relations and collective identities defined by
   victimhood. The sense of victimhood results in blurring boundaries
   between activists and their ``beneficiaries{''}, which influences their
   sense of accountability and motivates their practices. Third, the
   accountable self mobilises different accountability practices to deal
   with both the self's needs for narrativity and authenticity (e.g.,
   through storytelling and remembrance) and external demands for
   ``objective{''} accounts, thereby balancing their postcolonial and
   professional identities and responsibilities. Fourth, our interviewees
   sense that their accountability has limitations, as the accounts of
   human rights violations they produce receive insufficient recognition
   from others. Overall, the study indicates the importance of considering
   how a postcolonial identity of human rights activists creates various
   sources and motivations for the accountable self's relationships,
   practices and limitations distinguishable from, but linked, to those
   practised by NGOs.},

Title = {Auditor communication on critical audit matters: Timing, inspection

Journal = {CONTEMPORARY ACCOUNTING RESEARCH},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {41},
Number = {2},
Pages = {976-999},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {In response to the extended audit report regulations implemented in the
   United States and internationally, both audit firms and regulators have
   increased scrutiny over critical audit matters/key audit matters
   (collectively referred to as CAMs) through internal and external
   inspections. At the same time, auditors and audit committees (ACs) have
   altered the content and timing of CAM-related discussions by
   communicating specific planned audit procedures earlier in the audit
   process. This study explores the effect of early communication of
   CAM-related audit procedures to the AC and increased scrutiny from
   inspections on auditors' propensity to adjust planned audit procedures
   in the presence of newly identified audit risks. Based on
   self-justification theory, we predict and find that early communication
   of planned audit procedures to the AC causes auditors to be less likely
   to adjust planned audit procedures even when additional risks arise that
   necessitate change, especially when inspection is likely. This has the
   potential for diminished audit quality. Interviews with audit partners
   provide context for how these findings relate to the current auditing
   environment.
   La communication des questions cles de l'audit entre auditeurs :
   calendrier, probabilite d'inspection et comite d'auditEn reponse aux
   changements reglementaires touchant les rapports d'audit aux etats-Unis
   et a l'echelle internationale, les cabinets d'audit et les autorites de
   reglementation ont renforce la surveillance des questions critiques de
   l'audit/questions cles de l'audit (QCA) par l'ajout d'inspections
   internes et externes. Parallelement, les auditeurs et les comites
   d'audit ont modifie le contenu et le calendrier des seances de
   discussions relatives aux QCA en communiquant de maniere plus anticipee
   les procedures d'audit specifiques etablies dans le processus d'audit.
   Cette etude explore l'impact de la communication anticipee des
   procedures d'audit liees aux QCA au sein du comite d'audit. De plus,
   elle examine comment la surveillance accrue assuree par les inspections
   influence la propension des auditeurs a adapter les procedures d'audit
   prevues lorsque de nouveaux risques d'audit sont identifies. Sur la base
   de la theorie de l'autojustification, les auteurs formulent et etayent
   l'hypothese selon laquelle la communication anticipee des procedures
   d'audit au sein du comite d'audit incite les auditeurs a etre moins
   enclins a adapter les procedures d'audit etablies, meme en presence de
   risques supplementaires necessitant un changement, surtout si une
   inspection est probable. Cette situation peut entrainer une diminution
   de la qualite de l'audit. Des entretiens avec des associes d'audit
   permettent de comprendre comment ces resultats s'inscrivent dans le
   present contexte de l'audit.},

Abstract = {Business-to-business suppliers invest in safety training programs
   believing that such programs mitigate safety hazards, prevent workplace
   injuries, and create value for their customers. However, causal evidence
   of these effects is sparse. Study 1 uses site-level monthly data from a
   global oil field services company. Exploiting sharp discontinuities in
   safety training hours due to catastrophic accidents, the authors find
   that a 10\% increase in safety training hours per capita decreases
   safety hazards per capita by 6.45\%-9.57\%. Study 2 measures the causal
   impact of business establishments' safety training intensity on their
   workplace injuries: it leverages Local Law 196 requiring workers at
   construction establishments in New York City to complete at least ten
   hours of safety training. This legislation reduced injury rates at
   construction establishments in New York City by .54-.68 percentage
   points (a 15.56\%-18.84\% decrease) relative to their counterparts.
   Study 3, a stated-choice conjoint experiment of business-to-business
   procurement professionals, documents that the focal supplier's
   investment in safety training increases the probability of its proposal
   being selected by those professionals. Collectively, these findings
   validate the need for suppliers to invest in safety training as a
   risk-mitigation vehicle that has positive implications for
   business-to-business buying decisions.},

Title = {Monitoring and the Cold Start Problem in Digital Platforms: Theory and
   Evidence from Online Labor Markets},
Journal = {INFORMATION SYSTEMS RESEARCH},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 MAR 6},
Abstract = {Many online labor platforms employ reputation systems and monitoring
   systems to mitigate moral hazard. Whereas reputation systems have the
   potential to reduce moral hazard, they suffer from the cold -start
   problem, in which new entrants without an established reputation face a
   high entry barrier as employers predominantly select workers based on
   their existing reputation. Monitoring systems, providing employers with
   direct oversight of workers' actions, offer a different approach. By
   tracking and reporting workers' effort levels, monitoring systems reduce
   ex post information asymmetry and, thus, lower employers' expected moral
   hazard risk from workers. However, unlike reputation systems, monitoring
   systems do not directly address ex ante information asymmetry, failing
   to assist employers in identifying the right workers. This inherent
   limitation raises questions about their effectiveness in resolving the
   cold -start problem. In this paper, we first propose a stylized
   theoretical model that characterizes worker entry in the presence of
   reputation and monitoring systems. Based on a unique data set from a
   leading online labor platform, we then empirically investigate the
   effect of monitoring systems on the entry barriers by examining the
   change in workers' entry behaviors after the introduction of the
   monitoring system along with associated project outcomes, which include
   employers' hiring preferences, hiring prices, and project performance.
   We exploit the differential availability of the monitoring system across
   two project types: time -based projects, for which the monitoring system
   is accessible, and fixed -price projects, for which it is not. Employing
   a difference -in -differences estimation with a sample including 9,344
   fixed -price projects and 3,118 time -based projects, we report that the
   introduction of the monitoring system increases the number of bids on
   time -based projects by 27.8\%, and the incremental bids predominantly
   originate from inexperienced workers who lack platform reputation. We
   further find that, following the introduction of the monitoring system,
   employers' preference for experienced workers diminishes, accompanied by
   an average reduction of 19.5\% in labor costs, whereas we observe no
   significant decrease in project completion and review rating. Our
   results collectively suggest that monitoring systems alleviate the cold
   -start problem in online platforms.},

Abstract = {Research SummaryMultimodal data, comprising interdependent unstructured
   text, image, and audio data that collectively characterize the same
   source, with video being a prominent example, offer a wealth of
   information for strategy researchers. We emphasize the theoretical
   importance of capturing the interdependencies between different
   modalities when evaluating multimodal data. To automate the analysis of
   video data, we introduce advanced deep machine learning and data fusion
   methods that comprehensively account for all intra- and inter-modality
   interdependencies. Through an empirical demonstration focused on
   measuring the trustworthiness of grassroots sellers in live streaming
   commerce on Tik Tok, we highlight the crucial role of interpersonal
   interactions in the business success of microenterprises. We provide
   access to our data and algorithms to facilitate data fusion in strategy
   research that relies on multimodal data.Managerial SummaryOur study
   highlights the vital role of both verbal and nonverbal communication in
   attaining strategic objectives. Through the analysis of multimodal
   data-incorporating text, images, and audio-we demonstrate the essential
   nature of interpersonal interactions in bolstering trustworthiness, thus
   facilitating the success of microenterprises. Leveraging advanced
   machine learning techniques, such as data fusion for multimodal data and
   explainable artificial intelligence, we notably enhance predictive
   accuracy and theoretical interpretability in assessing trustworthiness.
   By bridging strategic research with cutting-edge computational
   techniques, we provide practitioners with actionable strategies for
   enhancing communication effectiveness and fostering trust-based
   relationships. Access our data and code for further exploration.},

Abstract = {Ecological psychology regards culture as a response to the demands of
   the environment. As rice farming in history has significantly influenced
   the formation of human cultural consciousness, we investigate how the
   rice culture of a chairperson's birthplace affects a firm's CSR
   activities. Our main finding reveals a positive and significant
   correlation between a chairperson's rice culture and CSR activities.
   Further analysis demonstrates that this positive relationship is
   particularly pronounced in private firms and family firms. We also
   examine the incremental effect of individual management heterogeneity
   and find that the positive relationship is strengthened when the
   chairperson has a shorter tenure or higher level of education.
   Additionally, more developed regions help enhance this positive
   relationship. To address the endogeneity concerns, we adopt an
   instrumental variable approach and exogenous event analysis based on
   chairperson turnover. The results are robust to a set of additional
   tests. Overall, our findings document the benefits of a chairperson's
   rice culture in developing countries like China and reveal how this
   benefit is priced into CSR performance.},

Volume = {35},
Number = {5},
Pages = {1704-1720},

Abstract = {The discussions of organizational politics and processes of
   organizational adaptation have developed as largely independent streams
   of work. However, we suggest that organizational politics-in particular,
   the power dynamics of the dominant coalition-can be a driver for
   patterns of both ``continuity and change{''} within organizations.
   Continuity is maintained by two inertial forces. First, a corporate
   strategy that conforms to the interest of the dominant coalition will
   tend to reinforce the power of that dominant coalition-an entrenchment
   effect. Second, even organizational units that were not initially part
   of the dominant coalition adapt their policies to that corporate
   strategy and, as a consequence, may come to support this status quo
   strategy. However, the political dynamics within the organization can
   also facilitate strategic change because shifts in the environment can
   alter the power structure of the organization, resulting in a new
   dominant coalition with a different agenda. The underlying basis is that
   organizations are multilevel systems in which subunits adapt to the
   organization's strategy, and that strategy, in turn, adapts to the
   subunits' current policies. We find that a self -interested political
   process can help ``unfreeze{''} the alignment between subunit policies
   and an organization's strategy in a changing environment, facilitating a
   more timely adaptive response than a strategy process based on the
   perceived collective interest of the organization as a whole. However,
   under high levels of goal conflict among subunits, coalitional power
   inhibits, rather than facilitates, adaptive change because of the
   entrenchment effect of power.},

Abstract = {Decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs)-collectively owned human
   -machine systems deployed on a blockchain that self -govern through
   smart contracts and the voluntary contributions of autonomous community
   members-exhibit the potential to facilitate collective action in
   managing digital commons. Yet the promise of decentralization and
   collective action is difficult to sustain. To this end, this paper
   critically examines the transformational potential of DAOs in the case
   of decentralized finance. Using a polycentric governance lens, we
   contribute to the literature on technology -enabled forms of organizing
   with a model explaining the transformational potential of DAOs to
   facilitate collective action in digital commons. Our study highlights
   that (1) DAOs are a new form of organizing enabled by blockchain
   technology in which individuals are free to pursue their objectives
   within a general system of rules enforced by smart contracts, (2)
   collective action for managing digital commons can be sustained through
   a set of three mechanisms-sustained participation, collective direction,
   and scaled organizing, and (3) DAOs tend to strike a balance between
   centralized and fully decentralized or community -based governance by
   implementing a polycentric governance system involving a combination of
   human and machine agency that creates skin in the game.},

Abstract = {A more equal and sustainable digital future depends on the inclusion of
   digitally marginalized communities in the socioeconomic opportunities
   created by digital technologies. Digital inclusion is a complex process
   that involves all stages of digital innovation, including development,
   adoption, use, and maintenance. However, past research has largely
   approached digital inclusion as an adoption and use challenge. In this
   paper, we develop a view of digital inclusion as a design challenge. We
   focus on the activities of requirements elicitation (RE) as a critical
   element of the design process and draw on a design-based interpretive
   study involving the design of two mobile apps for agricultural
   communities in India and China. We analyze how the conditions of digital
   inequality underlying the digital marginalization of these communities
   affect their sensemaking as they participate in RE activities. We
   conceptualize these challenges as limitations on the emergence of
   technology affordances. Our findings reveal various shifts, or
   translations, in the emerging affordances, which enabled the RE
   activities to be more generative and consequently more inclusive. These
   affordance translations manifested along three main dimensions:
   specificity, temporality, and collectivity. We discuss the implications
   of these findings for the inclusion of marginalized communities in the
   design of new technologies.},

Title = {USING DIGITAL NUDGES TO ENHANCE COLLECTIVE INTELLIGENCE IN ONLINE
   COLLABORATION INSIGHTS FROM UNEXPECTED OUTCOMES},
Journal = {MIS QUARTERLY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {48},

Abstract = {The dramatic expansion of internet communication tools has led to the
   increased use of temporary online groups to solve problems, provide
   services, or produce new knowledge. However, many of these groups need
   help to collaborate effectively. The rapid development of new tools and
   collaboration forms requires ongoing experimentation to develop and test
   new ways to support this novel form of teamwork. Building on research
   demonstrating the use of nudges to shape behavior, we report the results
   of an experiment to nudge teamwork in 168 temporary online groups
   randomly assigned to one of four different nudge treatments. Each nudge
   was designed to spur one of three targeted collaborative processes
   (collaborator skill use, effective task strategy, and the level of
   collective effort) demonstrated to enhance collective intelligence in
   extant research. Our results support the basic notion that digitally
   nudging collaborative processes can improve collective intelligence.
   However, to our surprise, a couple of nudges had unintended negative
   effects and ultimately decreased collective intelligence. We discuss our
   results using structured speculation to systematically consider the
   conditions under which we would or would not expect the same patterns to
   materialize in order to clearly articulate directions for future
   research.},

Abstract = {We study how Apple and independent repair service providers used
   different physical, regulatory, and digital instruments to influence
   each other's abilities to control the repair aftermarket of the Apple
   iPhone between 2007 and 2020. We show how the emergence of digital
   instruments for enacting control, made possible through emerging
   functionality for tethering, encryption, and temporary binding
   implemented in the iPhone itself, was shaped by and shaped the actions
   of Apple and the independent repair service providers, and led to a
   dominant tension between encrypted authorization and inscription of
   control through Apple and collective legal action by independent repair
   service providers. Our analysis provides a more nuanced understanding of
   control enactment by highlighting the implications of using different
   mediums for exercising control, and we provide a new way to understand
   the dialectics involved in enacting control in digital product
   aftermarkets. Our study provides insights that can inform the regulation
   of digital product aftermarkets-in particular, the ongoing debate about
   rights-to-repair legislation.},

Abstract = {Website localization plays an important role in guiding firms on how to
   customize websites across countries in which they have a local presence.
   However, few studies on website localization have systematically
   examined this topic from a theoretically grounded perspective. Drawing
   upon the theoretically driven consumer -company identification
   perspective, we propose that three website localization strategies (web
   similarity strategy, web distinctiveness strategy, and web prestige
   strategy) have positive effects on local users' perceived website
   localization, which, in turn , is related to local users' website
   loyalty. We further investigate the effects of these website
   localization strategies in a cross - cultural setting, focusing on the
   individualism -collectivism dimension of culture. Based on our online
   experiments in both the United States and China, we find that these
   website localization strategies have significant impacts on consumers'
   perceived website localization, which is related to consumers' website
   loyalty. We also find that web distinctiveness and web prestige
   strategies are more effective for people from collectivistic societies
   than for those from individualistic societies, whereas web similarity
   strategies do not differ across societal types. These findings highlight
   the importance of website localization strategies for customizing
   websites for global e -commerce.},

Title = {Representing, Re-presenting, or Producing the Past? Memory Work amongst
   Museum Employees},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT STUDIES},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 FEB 28},
Abstract = {Though it is widely understood that the past can be an important
   resource for organizations, less is known about the micro-level skills
   and choices that help to materialize different representations of the
   past. We understand these micro-level skills and choices as a practice:
   `memory work' - a banner term gathering various activities that provide
   the scaffolding for a shared past. Seeking to learn from a context where
   memory work is central, we share insights from a quasi-longitudinal
   study of UK museum employees. We theorize three ideal-typic regimes of
   memory work, namely representing, re-presenting and producing the past,
   and detail the micro-practices through which these regimes are enacted.
   Through explaining the key features of memory work in this context, our
   paper offers novel, broader insights into the relationship between
   occupations and memory work, showing how occupations differ in their
   understanding of memory and how this shapes their memory work.},

Title = {The proxy advisory industry: Influencing and being influenced},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF FINANCIAL ECONOMICS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {154},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {This paper develops two new methods to infer a mutual fund's proxy
   advisors from SEC filings. It then applies these methods to characterize
   features of the proxy advice industry from 2007 to 2021: (i) As of 2021,
   ISS and Glass Lewis collectively control approximately 90 percent of the
   market. During this period, the market share of ISS remains stable,
   while that of Glass Lewis has increased. (ii) When a proxy advisor
   issues a recommendation opposing management, its customers are
   approximately 20 percentage points more likely to also oppose management
   compared to other investors. (iii) Funds that subscribe to both proxy
   advisors tend to vote more similarly to the recommendations of the
   advisor whose voting platform they use. (iv) Proxy advisors often change
   their advisory stance when investors disagree with their previous
   advice. I offer suggestive evidence that this adaptation reflects both
   learning from informed investors and a desire by proxy advisors to align
   with the preferences of their customers.},

Pages = {1608-1640},
Month = {SEP-OCT},
Abstract = {Institutional scholarship on organizing in poverty contexts has focused
   on the constraining nature of extant institutions and the need for
   external actors to make transformative change interventions to alleviate
   poverty. Comparatively little attention has been paid to the potentially
   enabling nature of extant institutions in poverty contexts. We argue
   that more empirical work is needed to deepen our understanding of self
   -organizing processes that actors embedded in such contexts generate in
   their own efforts to survive. Drawing on the social worlds approach to
   institutional analysis, we shed light on how actors self -organize to
   produce enduring organizational arrangements to safeguard themselves
   against adverse poverty outcomes. Employing data from fieldwork and
   interviews collected in the urban neighborhood of Dagoretti Corner in
   Nairobi, Kenya, we examine the colocation of 105 largely identical auto
   repair businesses in close spatial proximity. We find that actors
   leverage an indigenous institution-the societal ethos of Harambee-to
   enable a process we identify as ``survivalist organizing.{''} Based on
   our research, we argue that survivalist organizing incorporates four
   interlocking survival mechanisms: cultivating interbusiness solidarity,
   maintaining precarious interbusiness relationships, redistributing
   resources to prevent business deaths, and generating collective
   philanthropy to avoid personal destitution. We develop a new research
   agenda on the institutional study of self -organizing in poverty
   contexts focused on strengthening rather than supplanting urbanized
   indigenous institutions that catalyze collective self -organizing.},

Title = {Corporate Scandals as Punctuating Events That Change Human Resource
   Roles},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 FEB 22},
Abstract = {Corporate scandals disrupt the landscape for organizational leaders and
   employees, providing a burning platform that creates new momentum for
   change. Here, we explore the implications for the human resources (HR)
   function as organization-level responses to scandals cannot occur
   without individual-level changes in employee behaviors-the domain of HR.
   We apply event systems theorizing to uncover the nature of the scandals
   through notions of strength, space, and time to better understand the
   range of possible outcomes for HR function roles. Empirical data are
   presented from in-depth qualitative case studies carried out in five
   large multinational corporations in the pharmaceutical, chemical, and
   financial services industries. Subsequently, we uncover how
   organization-level scandals punctuate the equilibrium of organizational
   operations, facilitating a recalibration of the balance between the
   potentially competing institutional logics of moral legitimacy and
   business priorities. We furthermore challenge universal HR role typology
   theorizing regarding the direct influence of external stakeholders on
   the role that HR can adopt inside organizations. Overall, we demonstrate
   that organizational responses to corporate scandals require
   individual-level and collective employee behavior change, placing the HR
   function at the intersection of managing risk, compliance, and legal
   requirements.},

Journal = {HUMAN RELATIONS},

Month = {2024 FEB 20},
Abstract = {Collaborative organising is known to burn like a rocket: it thrives on
   intense passion, relationality and creativity but quickly falls into
   pieces. This article explores the underestimated role of events and
   their affective atmospheres to sustain collaborative work. Drawing
   insights from two ethnographic field studies within an open-source
   software community and a network of impact entrepreneurs, we introduce
   the notion of `polyrhythmic affectivity' at the core of polycentric
   governance. It encapsulates how frictional reverberances between three
   atmospherically experienced affective intensities - togetherness,
   dissonance and mutuality - are able to maintain emergent yet enduring
   order. We argue that the collective motivational force of collaborative
   organising, can be stabilised through a process of `affective commoning'
   to sustain collaborative atmospheres as shared creative resources.},

Title = {Mispricing and Algorithm Trading},
Journal = {INFORMATION SYSTEMS RESEARCH},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 FEB 19},
Abstract = {The widespread adoption of information technology has fundamentally
   transformed the way information is processed in the financial market.
   One such technological advancement is algorithm trading, which allows
   traders to develop sophisticated strategies based on historical price
   data. This raises important questions: Do these algorithm trading
   strategies contribute to market instability? When do they yield profits
   for different market participants? To address these questions, we must
   move beyond the efficient market hypothesis, as this theory would
   suggest that such strategies yield no profit due to market efficiency.
   Instead, we explicitly incorporate initial market mispricing into our
   analysis and develop a stylized continuous-time model of algorithm
   feedback trading to investigate market outcomes. Our model yields
   closed-form solutions, enabling us to assess the degree to which the
   price diverges from the efficient level. We discover that algorithmic
   trading, when combined with initial market mispricing, can lead to
   significant market volatility, resulting in financial bubbles and
   crashes. However, this scenario only occurs when there is overpricing
   and the algorithm traders collectively employ a strategy that enlarges
   the mispricing. Depending on the initial mispricing in the form of
   underpricing or overpricing, different algorithm trading strategies
   (positive or negative) have different market impact, profitability, and
   policy implications.},

Abstract = {Although subordinate-to-supervisor relational identification (RI) has
   gained significant scholarly attention in organizational research, an
   understanding of its nomological network is incomplete. There have also
   been recurring discussions about its distinctions with another more
   extensively researched relational construct-leader-member exchange
   (LMX). In this meta-analysis, we expand Sluss and Ashforth's (2007)
   typology, going beyond the influence of the supervisor, to
   systematically study the antecedents and consequences of RI and its
   comparison with LMX. Meta-analytic results based on 157 independent
   samples demonstrate that positive leader behaviors that span role-based
   and person-based identities (e.g., transformational leadership,
   supervisor humility) are important antecedents of
   subordinate-to-supervisor RI, with effects contingent on subordinates'
   national culture (i.e., collectivism and power distance). Although less
   hypothesized, relational and organizational contexts as well as
   subordinate characteristics are also important antecedents of
   subordinate-to-supervisor RI. The results further show that RI relates
   to important subordinate behaviors and attitudes. Finally, we test how
   RI and LMX have differing effects across these important subordinate
   attitudes and behaviors. We conclude with suggestions to enhance our
   understanding of RI.},

Volume = {62},
Number = {3},

Abstract = {I examine how investors' search for different types of information
   affects managers' reporting decisions. I distinguish investors' search
   for information about firm fundamentals ({''}fundamental search{''})
   from their search for information about managers' incentives
   ({''}incentive search{''}). Based on a parsimonious model of
   misreporting, I predict that fundamental search reduces the earnings
   response coefficient, which reduces managers' benefits from
   misreporting, resulting in less misreporting. In contrast, incentive
   search increases the earnings response coefficient, which increases the
   benefits from misreporting, resulting in more misreporting. I test these
   predictions using an empirical technique that classifies EDGAR downloads
   as fundamental search or incentive search. Consistent with my
   theoretical predictions, I find that fundamental (incentive) search is
   negatively (positively) related to the earnings response coefficients
   and intentional restatements. I confirm my findings in two distinct
   empirical settings where the costs of information search exogenously
   changed: the adoption of XBRL and the electronic filing mandate of Form
   4s. Collectively, the results show that investors' information demand
   can shape managers' reporting decisions, and its effects can vary
   depending on the type of information investors search for.},

   this article, we try to extend this perspective by looking beyond the
   interactions of caregivers among themselves or with care seekers to
   reveal ethics as the ongoing collective accomplishment of a variety of
   actors. We do so by mobilizing Strauss's theoretical perspective of
   articulation work in the context of healthcare. Based on an ethnography,
   we show how actors of care (e.g., nurses, caregivers, or doctors)
   operate within care arrangements that need to be frequently
   rearticulated to face ethical threats and protect their patients'
   well-being. We distinguish three types of rearticulation corresponding
   to different degrees of rearticulation, individual actor stance, and
   specific ways of working things out. We discuss their implications for
   the maintenance of organizational ethics.},

Journal = {ADMINISTRATIVE SCIENCE QUARTERLY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {69},
Number = {2},
Pages = {324-369},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Organizations can motivate and coordinate work by socializing members to
   internalize organizational values. Existing theories posit that
   organizations achieve normative control through encapsulation, wherein
   peers and managers are primary sources of members' socialization.
   Drawing on ethnographic data from a not-for-profit school, I show how an
   external actor-beneficiaries-can become a source of normative control. I
   develop a multistage process that explains how teachers were socialized
   by parents, specifically by hearing these parent beneficiaries narrate
   their needs; engaging in collective storytelling about beneficiaries;
   experiencing episodic shaming centered on how teachers' daily
   performance met (or did not meet) beneficiaries' needs; and receiving
   validation from beneficiaries. Because these sequential stages establish
   beneficiaries as sources of control through social interactions set in
   specific times and places, and establish shared emotional states among
   organizational members, I theorize that these stages compose a ritual of
   integration. Although teachers initially arrived at the school with
   heterogeneous values, this ritual led many of them to internalize the
   organizational value of self-sacrifice. Teachers who were unmoved by
   parents' stories or came to see parents as exploitative did not
   internalize this value, and they tended to exit the organization. This
   study reveals how normative control can arise not only through
   socialization from in-group members but also from ritual interactions
   with and about beneficiaries.},

   difference-in-differences design, we report a significant fall in the
   magnitude of companies' discretionary accruals and the incidence of
   financial reporting irregularities after their auditors begin
   contributing to social welfare, relative to companies whose auditors
   refrain from contributing during the same timeframe. Additional evidence
   implies that the higher audit quality stems from auditors better
   protecting their independence and improving their competence in the
   post-contribution period. Collectively, our results provide insights
   into the importance of auditors' prosocial attitudes to their external
   monitoring.},

Volume = {67},
Number = {1},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {In this article, we advance a novel intra-individual conflict cognitive
   process framework, highlighting two structural elements of conflict
   experiences: (1) directions (sending vs. receiving) and (2) team
   boundaries (within team vs. between team). Integrating theorizing on
   cognitive resource allocation, we explain how and why the effect of
   individuals' conflict experiences on their task performances hinges upon
   their self -regulation of attention processes guided by the structural
   elements of conflict experiences. In Study 1, using data extracted from
   continuous audio and video streams of paramedics participating in
   liveactor mass -casualty response exercises, we found that sending
   within -team conflict and receiving between -team conflict related
   positively with task performance, whereas receiving within -team
   conflict related negatively to task performance. In Study 2, we
   conducted a mixed -design scenario -based experiment to examine the
   underlying mechanisms that drive such effects. Our findings reveal that
   on -task attentional pull was an important mechanism for a positive
   sending within -team conflict-task engagement relationship, whereas off
   -task attentional demands were driving the negative receiving within
   -team conflict-task engagement relationship. Collectively, we
   demonstrate that examining the intra-individual microfoundations of
   conflict in a multiteam context yields unique insights and enables
   building new theory on when and why conflict is beneficial or harmful.},

Abstract = {Research SummaryAlthough research has explored how executive hubris
   shapes organizational actions, we theorize that hubris can also develop
   outside the executive suite. We introduce the construct organizational
   hubris, which we define as a durable, collective attitude marked by
   exaggerated pride and confidence in the organization. Organizational
   hubris differs from executive hubris in terms of level (individual
   versus collective) and target (self-focused vs. organization-focused).
   We argue that organizational hubris can develop among
   high-identification organizations via an external route (positive
   external attributions) or an internal route (charismatic messaging from
   top leaders), or both. Once developed, organizational hubris affects
   important outcomes by shaping (1) how external stakeholders perceive the
   organization, (2) how insiders treat external stakeholders, and (3) the
   relationship among internal stakeholders-particularly between employees
   and top managers.Managerial SummaryAmong the many stories of corporate
   excess, some organizations exhibit a sense of superiority-the view that
   success is inevitable and failure impossible-that can shape their very
   nature. In this article, we depart from the idea that hubris is confined
   to the C-suite and introduce the construct organizational hubris, which
   we define as a durable, collective attitude marked by exaggerated pride
   and confidence in the organization. Organizational hubris can develop
   from positive external attributions and/or charismatic messaging from
   top leaders. Once developed, organizational hubris affects important
   strategic outcomes by shaping (1) how external stakeholders perceive the

Title = {Digital Approaches to Societal Grand Challenges: Toward a Broader
   Research Agenda on Managing Global-Local Design Tensions},
Journal = {INFORMATION SYSTEMS RESEARCH},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 JAN 29},
Abstract = {Information systems (IS) scholars have pursued phenomenon -specific
   research to meaningfully engage with and contribute to addressing
   societal grand challenges (GCs). Although such efforts are invaluable, a
   broader framework that identifies generalized organizing problems in
   tackling GCs and reveals promising pathways for digital technologies to
   add value in addressing them could help establish an agenda for
   impactful IS research. In this article, we offer such a framework by
   drawing on Ostrom's principles of public value creation and management
   research on organizational design. We identify a set of eight organizing
   design tensions that arise from employing global and local perspectives
   in addressing GCs. We consider digital approaches to resolving each of
   these design tensions and delineate a rich and diverse agenda for future
   research. We acknowledge prevailing socio-political structures and
   factors that may constrain the effectiveness of digital solutions and
   adopt a socio-technical design perspective to suggest alternative
   arrangements of digital and socio-political elements in GC settings. Our
   discussion foreshadows the considerable opportunity for IS research to
   contribute to the broader dialog on GCs by integrating existing IS
   theoretical perspectives and concepts with complementary theories from
   management and beyond. Our framework also informs and enriches GC
   phenomenon -specific IS research by helping to generalize the research
   questions and allowing for crossphenomenon mapping of critical study
   insights. More broadly, the pursuit of the research agenda proposed
   here, along with entering a broader GC conversation with other
   disciplines and stakeholders, may speed the identification and enactment
   of effective solutions to grand challenges.},

Journal = {HUMAN RELATIONS},

Abstract = {How do individuals who engage in high-risk work deal with the
   existential threats that are part and parcel of their daily activities?
   Based on a qualitative study of fighter pilots, we find that experiences
   and responses to existential threats are shaped by three intersubjective
   processes, that is, socially constructed and accepted patterns of
   interactions by which individuals come to view existential threats as
   one of several challenges of their work, something that is common yet
   unremarkable. These processes draw from and impinge upon cherished
   social identities to inculcate in individuals: (1) a preoccupation with
   performance as a precondition for continued membership, thereby crowding
   out death anxiety; (2) a willingness to withstand no-holds barred
   collective scrutiny, thereby keeping their egos under check, and
   enhancing learning and safety; and (3) a view of death as a commonplace
   and therefore unremarkable facet of their activities. The contribution
   of our study is to illuminate the intersubjective processes implicated
   in the development of social identities that enable individuals in
   high-risk work to function effectively despite the existential threats
   they face.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS STUDIES},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {55},
Number = {5},
Pages = {616-637},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {This research employs a difference-in-differences framework to study the
   impact of major board reforms on the performance of mergers and
   acquisitions (M\&As). Using an international sample of board reforms
   implemented in 61 countries from 1985 to 2021, we document a drastic
   redistribution of wealth from target shareholders to acquirer
   shareholders after the board reforms in target countries. This effect is
   most pronounced in M\&A transactions that involve the sale of
   controlling shares, thereby supporting the hypothesis that corporate
   board reforms mitigate the private benefits of control in the target
   firm. Furthermore, these reforms increase expected deal synergies, in
   that deal-level announcement returns are higher after the implementation
   of the reforms. When country-level institutional quality and legal
   protection of shareholders are greater, it reinforces the reform
   effects. Overall M\&A activity remains unchanged following the reforms,
   yet financial bidders complete fewer transactions, implying a
   reform-induced squeeze-out of financial bidders from the M\&A market in
   the target country. Collectively, these international results are
   consistent with the predictions of the private benefits of control
   theory and underscore the role of institutional quality and investor
   protection in reinforcing the effects of board reforms worldwide.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF CONSUMER PSYCHOLOGY},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 JAN 12},
Abstract = {This research finds evidence for a plural name advantage on brand
   attitude. Six studies, including two archival datasets with real market
   brands and four experiments using fictitious brands, show that brands
   with plural names (e.g., Dunkin' Donuts) are associated with more
   favorable brand attitude than brands with singular names (e.g., Dunkin'
   Donut). This plural brand name advantage is driven by perceptions of
   brand entitativity emerging from the collective reading of plural
   entities. However, the positive effect of plural brand names on brand
   attitude is attenuated in the case of premium brands. This research has
   practical implications for brand name strategy and makes a theoretical
   contribution by bringing attention to the under-researched space of
   morphology in brand name linguistics.},

   Responses to Crowdfunding Appeals},

Abstract = {This research uses a crowdfunding context to examine when and why a
   simple difference in frame-using ``want{''} versus ``need{''} in the
   request-affects funders' compliance with an appeal for contributions.
   Building on the semantic framing and psycholinguistics literature, we
   propose that using ``want{''} (vs. ``need{''}) signals that the
   fundraiser is a relatively less (vs. more) dependent person. This
   perception difference then exerts opposing effects on the two major
   forms of crowdfunding appeals. For reward-based appeals, in which
   fundraisers promise a return on contribution, funders have a for-profit
   (i.e., incentive-seeking) goal and are more willing to contribute to a
   less dependent fundraiser. In contrast, for donation-based appeals, in
   which no incentives are promised by the fundraisers, funders are
   primarily motivated by a nonprofit (i.e., helping) goal and are more
   willing to contribute to a fundraiser who is seen as more dependent on
   help. Therefore, we predict that a ``want{''} (vs. ``need{''}) frame is
   more effective in reward-based (vs. donation-based) crowdfunding.
   Results from two large-scale observational studies and four experiments
   support our predictions and also illuminate the underlying mechanisms.
   Collectively, the findings contribute to the literature on semantic
   framing and crowdfunding and also offer practical implications for
   fundraisers, marketers, and policymakers.},

Abstract = {Surely a leader should know what to do? But what happens when complexity
   means they cannot know which path to take? We answer this question with
   an ethnographic study of distributed leadership (DL) in an organisation
   grappling with inherent tensions within its mission. The article makes a
   counter-intuitive argument for the value and utility of unknowingness,
   defined as a state of awareness of both an absence of knowing and one's
   inability to know. Three inter-related aspects to unknowingness are
   developed - acceptance of not knowing, tolerance of the discomfort of
   not knowing, and distribution of unknowingness - leading to an
   innovative theory of unknowingness. We reveal how unknowingness and DL
   are bound with each other in the sense that not knowing can enable
   distribution of leadership within the organisation, whilst DL addresses
   challenges in complex organisations associated with not knowing. We
   thereby provide an illustration of the interplay between those with
   hierarchical authority and others dispersed throughout an organisation.
   In sum, we provide an alternative perspective to the heroic, all-knowing
   individual leader.},

Abstract = {Research SummaryCollecting fine-grained, longitudinal data to study new
   venture creation (NVC) is critical but empirically challenging given the
   partly invisible, collective, and highly discursive nature of NVC. This
   article offers the ethnography/accelerator approach as one powerful
   solution to this problem. This approach theorizes the implications
   raised by the invisible, collective, and highly discursive nature of NVC
   as challenges of accessibility, multivocality, and reflexivity. It
   provides a framework articulating these challenges with key ethnographic
   insights to advance data collection and theory building, before
   discussing five implications of this approach for NVC research and
   providing recommendations and points of caution.Managerial
   SummaryExplaining how to create, organize, and operate a new venture is
   critical but raises important methodological challenges. Early-stage
   ventures have no operating history, the stakeholders collaborating with
   entrepreneurs are geographically dispersed, and entrepreneurs' stories
   are often examined uncritically. The ethnography/accelerator approach
   suggests overcoming these challenges by using business accelerators as a
   research setting to apply ethnographic methods and collect reliable
   data. It provides guidance for enabling the full-time immersion of the
   researcher into this setting, allowing the collection of finely-grained
   data capturing the day-to-day practices and interactions at the heart of
   new venture creation and the views of the entrepreneurs, mentors,
   investors, policymakers, and the like playing a pivotal role in this
   process.},

Journal = {ORGANIZATION STUDIES},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {45},
Number = {1, SI},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {To confront the climate crisis requires fundamental system change in
   order to break the convention of relentless economic exploitation of
   nature. In this Special Issue we extend understanding of the
   opportunities for an organizing perspective on sustainability in order
   that organization studies might contribute more effectively to the
   challenges of organizing sustainably. This organizing perspective is
   particularly sensitive to (1) a variety of forms and practices of
   sustainable organizing in different societal spheres and on different
   levels, (2) the social institutions, logics and value systems in which
   these forms and practices are embedded, (3) the power and politics of
   promoting (or blocking) sustainable organization, and (4) the ways in
   which work, voice, participation, and inclusion are organized and
   contribute to developing societal capabilities. These features formed
   the basis of our original call for papers and we review selected
   literature on sustainability, including the contribution of organization
   studies and the articles in this Special Issue, through this organizing
   perspective. In so doing we identify four key themes of a future
   research agenda that builds from the foundations of existing research
   and addresses key current limitations in both theory and practice:
   sustainability requires social justice; connecting local and global
   scale shifts; democratizing governance; and acting collectively. We
   conclude with some implications for our own scholarship in organization
   studies if we are to meet the twin challenges of the need for new
   theorizing in combination with devising practically relevant support for
   change.},

Volume = {49},
Number = {1},
Pages = {107-134},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {We develop a stakeholder theory of corporate governance grounded in
   classical property rights theory, adopting the view that governance
   should help free individuals to maximize their collective welfare. In
   contrast to the agency view of corporate governance, we submit that the
   central problem in corporate governance is to devise coalitional
   contracting solutions to the collective action problems inherent in team
   production and team innovation. Agency problems and other contracting
   problems resulting from shirking, hold-up, market power, and
   externalities are best understood in this context. We develop design
   principles for the allocation of property rights to mitigate each of
   these contracting problems by reducing stakeholders' vulnerabilities to
   opportunistic behaviors. We extend earlier efforts to build a
   stakeholder theory of corporate governance by considering a more
   comprehensive set of transaction problems and analyzing the comparative
   efficiency of different governance arrangements for different types of
   firm-stakeholder relationships and different economic contexts. One
   conclusion from our theory is that giving primacy to shareholders, or
   any other group of stakeholders, is a comparatively inefficient solution
   to governing the modern global and knowledge-driven corporation. We
   discuss the implications of our theorizing for the debate about the
   purpose of the firm.},

Journal = {ADMINISTRATIVE SCIENCE QUARTERLY},

Volume = {69},
Number = {1},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Through an ethnographic study of decision making in a rape crisis
   center, I explore how institutional logics come to be through
   interactions. Zooming in on storytelling interactions and slowing down
   to follow their evolution, I find that collective cognitive, political,
   and emotional elements mediated the narration of logics into effect.
   While the interactions unfolded within a space of possibilities
   determined by logics, co-narrators still put much cognitive effort into
   negotiating which logic was relevant and how it implicated specific ways
   of understanding and responding to events. Narrators' subject positions
   and their perceived interests and emotions also mediated the work of
   logics on the ground. Decisions were determined by degrees of coherence
   across these cognitive, political, and emotional elements. When there
   was high or moderate coherence, the decision followed the resolution
   implied by the narration. When coherence was low, decision makers
   rejected the decision implied by the narration. Coherence, then,
   constrained people's agency to invoke institutional logic. These results
   offer compelling new theory about how institutional logics work: logics
   are neither deterministic nor freely manipulated but instantiated
   through collective and situated dynamics that set limits on their
   strategic use.},

Title = {Digital Contact Tracing for Pandemic Response: The Roles of Cultural
   Worldviews and Technology Awareness},
Journal = {INFORMATION SYSTEMS RESEARCH},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 DEC 21},
Abstract = {The use of digital contact tracing (DCT) during the COVID-19 pandemic
   serves as a prime example of how government agencies and public
   authorities are leveraging information technologies to address complex
   societal challenges. However, during the period in which the study was
   conducted, the rate of voluntary adoption of DCT among individuals in
   the United States proved to be both low and uneven, falling short of the
   critical mass required for effective containment of viral transmission.
   Despite previous research suggesting that individuals' willingness to
   use DCT is primarily driven by their perceived benefits and privacy
   concerns, and that DCT awareness could help individuals make more
   informed adoption decisions, the factors contributing to the mixed
   perceptions of DCT remain unexplored. Drawing on cultural cognition
   theory, we propose that individuals' perceptions of risks, specifically
   privacy concerns in our context, and perceptions of benefits regarding
   DCT can be influenced by their cultural worldviews. Furthermore, the
   influence of DCT awareness on individuals' perceptions of DCT is
   moderated by their cultural worldviews. This occurs because individuals
   tend to seek out and interpret information in a manner consistent with
   their existing worldviews. Based on a survey of 1,014 U.S. residents,
   our study demonstrates that cultural worldviews characterized by two
   dimensions, group, emphasizing collective responsibility in addressing
   personal needs, and grid, focusing on behavioral regulation based on
   values and attitudes pertaining to social hierarchies and established
   norms, significantly affect both perceived benefits and privacy concerns
   related to DCT. These perceptions, in turn, impact individuals'
   intention to use DCT. Furthermore, individuals with a high-group
   worldview or a low-grid worldview exhibit a stronger positive
   association between DCT awareness and perceived benefits, and a stronger
   negative association between DCT awareness and privacy concerns. Our
   findings further reveal that cultural worldviews not only influence
   individuals' biases in selecting media outlets for technological
   information but also shape their risk-benefit assessment of other
   emerging technologies designed to tackle societal issues. In summary,
   this study highlights the pivotal role that cultural worldviews play in
   understanding public support for information technologies aimed at
   addressing complex societal challenges.},

Title = {The Anchoring Effect, Algorithmic Fairness, and the Limits of
   Information Transparency for Emotion Artificial Intelligence},

Abstract = {Emotion artificial intelligence (AI) or emotion recognition AI may
   systematically vary in its recognition of facial expressions and
   emotions across demographic groups, creating inconsistencies and
   disparities in its scoring. This paper explores the extent to which
   individuals can compensate for these disparities and inconsistencies in
   emotion AI considering two opposing factors; although humans evolved to
   recognize emotions, particularly happiness, they are also subject to
   cognitive biases, such as the anchoring effect. To help understand these
   dynamics, this study tasks three commercially available emotion AIs and
   a group of human labelers to identify emotions from faces in two image
   data sets. The scores generated by emotion AI and human labelers are
   examined for inference inconsistencies (i.e., misalignment between
   facial expression and emotion label). The human labelers are also
   provided with the emotion AI's scores and with measures of its scoring
   fairness (or lack thereof). We observe that even when human labelers are
   operating in this context of information transparency, they may still
   rely on the emotion AI's scores, perpetuating its inconsistencies.
   Several findings emerge from this study. First, the anchoring effect
   appears to be moderated by the type of inference inconsistency and is
   weaker for easier emotion recognition tasks. Second, when human labelers
   are provided with information transparency regarding the emotion AI's
   fairness, the effect is not uniform across emotions. Also, there is no
   evidence that information transparency leads to the selective anchoring
   necessary to offset emotion AI disparities; in fact, some evidence
   suggests that information transparency increases human inference
   inconsistencies. Lastly, the different models of emotion AI are highly
   inconsistent in their scores, raising doubts about emotion AI more
   generally. Collectively, these findings provide evidence of the
   potential limitations of addressing algorithmic bias through individual
   decisions, even when those individuals are supported with information
   transparency.},

Volume = {55},

Abstract = {Studies on multi-stakeholder processes and cross-sector partnerships
   have demonstrated that multiple stakeholders across different sectors
   can resolve sustainable development issues when they combine their
   complementary resources and capacities. These studies have highlighted
   the role of multinational enterprises (MNEs), considering their
   requisite resources and capacities to implement intervention strategies.
   However, MNEs' role remains largely underexplored in the context of
   non-state cultural regions where state governance is entirely lacking.
   Drawing on the findings of ethnographic fieldwork conducted in the
   Golden Triangle region near Thailand, Myanmar, and Laos borders, this
   study investigates how multiple stakeholders' collective interventions
   transformed the illicit drug-based economy of the region into an
   alternative sustainable economy. The region once supplied 60\% of the
   illicit drugs distributed worldwide, yet a series of cross-sector
   interventions transformed the region into a sustainable economy over the
   past 60 years. The findings show that the foreign subsidiaries of MNEs
   proactively explored the unknown region and shared knowledge with other
   actors, which helped participating stakeholders effectively address
   regional sustainable development issues. The resulting process model
   sheds light on MNEs' central roles at various stages of the
   multi-stakeholder process, offering new insights into informal
   institutions and intercultural studies in the field of international
   business.},

Journal = {RESEARCH POLICY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {53},
Number = {2},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Innovation ecosystems have gained significant scholarly and managerial
   attention. Much of the literature focuses on established ecosystems, and
   the limited research that examines ecosystem emergence does not dig
   deeper into the dynamics and challenges during the process of emergence.
   With a focus on the transition from birth to growth of an ecosystem,
   this paper fills this important gap by systematically examining how a
   nascent ecosystem develops into a thriving one. Employing a
   conceptualized composition approach, we conduct an in-depth qualitative
   study on the emergence of the modern small satellite ecosystem from 1981
   to 2017. Our case analysis demonstrates a dynamic process through which
   a seed innovation gradually grows into a thriving ecosystem without a
   centralized sponsor. We explicate how tensions arise within an evolving
   ecosystem and how forces hindering specialization delay the emergence
   process. We then develop a process model of ecosystem emergence to
   conceptualize how actors gradually become specialized, how their
   specialization decisions coevolve with the ecosystem value proposition,
   and how tensions get resolved through a complex and iterative process.
   We contribute to the literature by advancing an evolutionary view of
   ecosystem emergence with an in-depth analysis of the transition from
   birth to growth of an ecosystem.},

Journal = {ORGANIZATION STUDIES},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {45},
Number = {3},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Misogyny is a significant but unspoken presence in organization studies,
   in terms of people's experiences of work and as a theorized concept. In
   this essay we argue that our community should dare to name misogyny for
   its unique insight into the enduring patriarchal power relations that
   condition so many organizations and so much of our organization theory.
   We develop this argument in two ways: first, we suggest that misogyny
   provides a unique descriptive linguistic label for experiences of
   gendered hatred, violence and social policing; and second, a
   philosophical understanding of misogyny enables analysis and
   understanding of, as well as challenges to, the physical or symbolic
   violence that many experience in and around organizations as sites for
   the reproduction of patriarchy. Drawing on recent developments in
   feminist analytic philosophy, we follow the movement away from
   understanding misogyny-as-individual-emotion to
   misogyny-as-affective-practice. This allows us to frame two related
   concepts, organized and organizational misogyny, demonstrating the
   potential that misogyny brings to understanding individual experiences,
   collective affect and influential social forces. Despite the discomfort
   produced by hate-based concepts such as misogyny, we conclude that their
   exclusion from organization studies has two effects: the continuing
   reproduction of violent hostility, and acceptance of a partial account
   of multiple forms of oppression and inequality. Our research agenda,
   founded on this need for naming such experiences, the significance of
   affect and aggregated oppressions, demonstrates the potential
   contribution of misogyny to addressing these issues and finding some
   hope for change.},

Abstract = {Research SummaryIn socially contested settings, it is often difficult to
   connect with (diverse) others, and it is unclear how entrepreneurs in
   these contexts may develop the social ties that previous research has
   shown to be valuable. We studied this subject matter in Kenya, an
   ethnically fractionalized society that recently experienced the
   decentralization of government, which required entrepreneurs to deal
   with both in-group and out-group ethnicities. We conducted an inductive
   case study of four Nairobi-based companies and captured the creative
   tactics that they used to transcend ethnic homophily (by defocusing from
   ethnicity and reframing the in-group) while also asserting ethnic
   homophily (by signaling tribal affiliation and leveraging others'
   ethnicity). We contribute to a deeper understanding of how and why
   entrepreneurs in socially contested settings develop social
   ties.Managerial SummaryEntrepreneurs in socially contested settings rely
   on social networks to access resources and opportunities. However, it is
   unclear how entrepreneurs in these settings develop and use these
   networks. We studied this question in an ethnically fractionalized
   setting that recently experienced the decentralization of government:
   Kenya. Entrepreneurs who previously provided information technology (IT)
   services to the central government had to deal with both own-tribe and
   other-tribe contacts to receive new contracts. We studied four
   Nairobi-based IT firms that operated across a variety of counties and
   analyzed the creative tactics that entrepreneurs in this context use to
   cross ethnic divides while also working with own-tribe contacts. This
   contributes to our collective understanding of how and why entrepreneurs
   in socially contested settings develop diverse social ties to access

   differences (SCD) in convex environments. These include preferences over
   lotteries, both in expected utility and rank-dependent utility
   frameworks, and preferences over bundles of goods and over consumption
   streams. Our notion of SCD does not presume an order on the choice
   space. This unordered SCD is necessary and sufficient for ``interval
   choice{''} comparative statics. We present applications to cheap talk,
   observational learning, and collective choice, showing how convex
   environments arise in these problems and how SCD/interval choice are
   useful. Methodologically, our main characterization stems from a result
   on linear aggregations of single-crossing functions.},

   integrative negotiations. In the literature, two opposing positions
   exist reflecting a complexity dilemma regarding the number of
   negotiation issues: One position suggests that complex negotiations
   involving higher numbers of issues offer more trade-off opportunities,
   thereby providing negotiators with greater structural flexibility in
   reaching mutually beneficial agreements, which improves outcome quality.
   The opposite position emphasizes that the greater information load
   inherent in negotiating more issues impedes outcome quality. We propose
   a third, intermediate position: Negotiating more issues may only improve
   outcome quality up to a threshold, above which adding further issues
   results in deteriorated outcomes. We tested these propositions using a
   quasi-meta-analytic technique by examining the associations between the
   number of issues, joint gains, and impasse rates across multiple
   empirical studies on integrative negotiations using various negotiation
   tasks with different numbers of issues (N = 38,063/21,271 negotiations
   for joint gains/impasse rates). Moreover, we investigated whether
   factors related to how negotiators subjectively deal with the increased
   complexity associated with higher numbers of issues moderate the
   number-of-issues effect on joint gains. Multilevel analyses revealed no
   significant number-of-issues effect on joint gains up to a threshold of
   3 issues but a negative effect for negotiations involving more than 3
   issues. By contrast, we did not find a number-of-issues effect on
   impasse rates. Moreover, we did not obtain evidence for moderation
   effects. Findings are discussed with respect to their theoretical and
   practical implications.},

Abstract = {We study how collectivism, religion-tradition, thriftiness, and
   status/materialist consumption values jointly shape consumption
   preferences in seven Asian markets. These markets are diverse but
   relatively small, so identifying similarities should help companies
   implement standardized marketing strategies. Using data from 3000+
   consumers, we find the effects to be largely similar. Collectivistic
   values directly and indirectly increase both religious and thriftiness
   values, both of which negatively affect status consumption values.
   However, the direct positive effect of collectivistic values on status
   consumption values is so strong that it dominates all of these
   countervailing negative effects, which explains the paradoxical affinity
   of Asian consumers towards luxury consumption while endorsing the moral
   virtues of thriftiness. We identify the effects these values have on
   preference towards symbolic (style, prestige, overseas origin) and
   utilitarian (durability, and value for price) attributes. Our results
   have implications for international marketing theory by highlighting the
   role of values in Asian consumption, and for practice by helping
   marketers arrive at more informed standardized brand/product strategies
   in these rapidly growing Asian markets. In particular, they support
   earlier findings that high and increasing luxury consumption in Asia may
   not be due to increasing individualism nor Westernization, but because
   collectivists have their own reasons for valuing status consumption.},

Abstract = {Although organizations increasingly seek to communicate allyship with
   the Black community, their ally state-ments can receive vastly different
   responses from Black observers. We develop and test a theoretical model
   outlining key drivers of allyship evaluations among these perceivers.
   Drawing from signaling theory and inte-grating insights from the
   literature on identity safety, we reveal the costliness and consistency
   of ally statements as critical determinants of Black perceivers'
   evaluations of organizations as allies. Two studies-the first leveraging
   statements released by Fortune 500 companies and the second a more
   controlled follow-up exper-iment-demonstrate the interactive effects of
   cost and consistency on these assessments. Specifically, the most
   positive allyship evaluations emerged for organizations whose statements
   conveyed both high cost and high consistency. Our findings have
   implications for organizations and business leaders who aim to
   communicate allyship. To be recognized as allies, devoting resources and
   incurring costs is not enough; organizations must also signal a
   consistent commitment to supporting marginalized communities.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we adopt a multistakeholder governance perspective to
   study how people collectively respond to a grand challenge.
   Specifically, we show how working through governance obstacles-that is,
   coordinating and collaborating challenges arising from a
   multistakeholder governance approach to responding to grand
   challenges-can erode actors' ability to mitigate these wicked problems.
   We illustrate this process through an in-depth case study of
   WaterHealthOrg, a multistakeholder initiative established to address
   degrading water health in Australia's critical Great Barrier Reef
   region. Our findings reveal how, in an effort to avoid group paralysis
   or dissolution, actors employ specific practices to address governance
   obstacles. By doing so, actors set off a cumulative self-reinforcing
   process, driving them to consolidate rather than critically reflect on
   and adapt their collective response. Drawing on these insights, we
   develop a conceptual process model of how efforts to manage
   multistakeholder governance obstacles can generate governance traps that
   shape participants' ability to collectively respond and, ultimately,
   mitigate grand challenges.},

Abstract = {This study proposes a unified, dynamic framework based on turnover event
   theory to evaluate the effects of dismissals, layoff announcements, and
   voluntary turnover on subsequent work-unit voluntary turnover. Applying
   our approach to 1,620 retail stores over 22 months, we show that
   modeling exit events as a dynamic and interdependent system adds to our
   ability to predict subsequent human capital outflow. Dismissals had the
   weakest total effect on subsequent voluntary turnover, layoff
   announcements had the strongest and most immediate effects, and
   voluntary turnovers had moderate but lasting effects. We also find that
   these three exit reasons each exhibit a distinct pattern of subsequent
   turnover intensity and longevity. Based on characteristics of work units
   in our setting, our results correspond to a cumulative worker-level
   average effect of 0.17 quits following dismissals, 0.23 quits following
   quits, and 2.2 quits following a layoff. We find that these
   ``multiplier{''} effects are concentrated among workers of similar
   performance: high performer exits beget high performer quits, just as
   low-performer exits beget lowperformer quits. Our findings suggest
   analyses offering individual-level estimates of turnover will generally
   underestimate the broader, work-unit level consequences of individual
   exit events on similar workers.},

Abstract = {With the rapid development of fintech, the need for dynamic credit risk
   evaluation is becoming increasingly important. While previous studies on
   credit scoring have mostly focused on single-period loan default
   prediction, we call for a new avenue-multiperiod default prediction
   (MPDP)-to depict risk profiles over time. To address the challenges
   raised by MPDP, such as monotonic default probability prediction and
   complex relationship accommodation, we propose a novel approach, hybrid
   and collective scoring (HACS). We design a hybrid modeling strategy to
   predict whether and when a borrower will default separately through a
   default discrimination model and a default time estimation model,
   respectively, and synthesize them through a probabilistic framework. To
   accommodate various possible patterns of default time and measure the
   distribution of default probability over successive time intervals, we
   propose a joint default modeling method to train the default time
   estimation model. Empirical evaluations at the model (time-to-default
   prediction performance and discrimination performance) and mechanism
   (identifiability and discriminability) levels, as well as impact
   analyses at the application (granting performance and profitability
   performance) level, show that HACS outperforms the benchmarked survival
   analysis and multilabel learning methods on all fronts. It can more
   accurately predict time-to-default and provide financial institutions
   and investors better decision-support in granting loans and selecting
   loan portfolios.},

Abstract = {Persistent war is an increasing reality for millions of people
   worldwide. War contexts create a wide range of problems, but
   paradoxically may fuel some entrepreneurial activities. This inductive,
   qualitative study explores how an entrepreneurial ecosystem was launched
   and sustained amid an ongoing civil war despite repeated setbacks,
   disruptions, and impediments to pursuing collective goals. Building on
   our longitudinal qualitative data, we show how the entrepreneurial
   ecosystem was repeatedly reshaped by altering collective goals as well
   as providing the pathways and sense of agency needed to make progress
   toward ever-shifting goals. Our research culminates in a grounded
   theoretical model of an entrepreneurial ecosystem of hope, which
   contributes to our comprehension of entrepreneurship within war-affected
   regions and provides valuable insights into the dynamics of collective
   hope. This study offers practical implications for policy makers and
   practitioners by illuminating the role of entrepreneurial phenomena in
   the challenging context of war.},

Title = {The Board Committee Chair Effect: How Much Does It Contribute to Firm
   Performance?},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 NOV 28},
Abstract = {Boards of directors rely on committees to perform important specialized
   monitoring and advising tasks. While there is general consensus that
   committees and their chairs influence board outcomes and, thus, firm
   performance, we know little about the magnitude of these effects on firm
   performance. Using variance decomposition, we show that audit,
   compensation, and nominating committee chairs explain a significant
   portion of variance in firm financial performance. Some of the
   performance variance attributed to committee chairs comes from the
   increased explanatory power of adding an important level of strategic
   leaders. However, most of the committee chair effect seems to stem from
   performance variance that prior research may have inaccurately
   attributed to firm executives and other influences. For example, our
   results show that committee chairs, collectively, have a stronger
   influence on firm performance than board chairs, illustrating a need for
   more research on the critical role committee chairs play in the
   functioning of committees, boards, and firms. Furthermore, in additional
   analyses, we find that committee chair effects can differ across board
   leadership structures and time periods.},

Abstract = {Research Summary: As the study of entrepreneurship advances, our
   appreciation for the role of theory in the development of the field has
   grown. In this paper, we build on our collective experiences to offer a
   peek into the inner workings of entrepreneurship theorizing, using
   specific examples to highlight ways of developing theoretical insights
   for advancing entrepreneurship research. Our journeys suggest an
   iterative process centered on asking an important and interesting
   question, challenging prevailing assumptions, understanding context and
   phenomenon, and developing conceptual models and analyses. We focus on
   the uniqueness of entrepreneurial phenomena, contexts, and actors as
   well as the interdisciplinary nature of the field.
   Managerial Summary: Entrepreneurship as a scholarly field has reached a
   stage of maturity where we need to think more carefully about our
   contribution to theory. Theory enriches managerial parctice. We offer
   helpful and actionable suggestions to develop and share rich theoerical
   insights that inform schaolrship and practice.},

Title = {The Patterning of Interactive Organizational Identity Work},
Journal = {ORGANIZATION STUDIES},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {45},
Number = {3},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Our study delves into how organizational identity work unfolds during
   interpersonal interactions among members of an organization. Most
   existing research focuses on the isolated utterances of individual
   members or on organizational-level discourse. Analyzing directly the
   interrelationships between individuals allows us to offer a fresh
   viewpoint on the concept of ``organizational identity work.{''} Based on
   a longitudinal case study of an open innovation organization from
   inception, we reveal multiple patterns of interactive organizational
   identity work emerging over time. Although Monologue is a one-sided
   pattern that involves the dominance of a single voice, Polyphony
   involves episodes of engaged collective conversation about identity
   issues without clear resolution. In Dialogue, we see interactions around
   critical issues accumulating towards temporary compromises on identity
   concerns, whereas the Deadlock pattern arises when compromises appear
   unattainable, potentially culminating in Rupture, as interactions around
   identity lead members to dissociate themselves from the organization. We
   show how the direct and indirect focus on organizational identity issues
   (i.e., whether identity is the focal topic of conversation, or a
   consideration brought up in making another decision), as well as the
   intensity of personal identity engagement among participants (i.e., the
   degree to which the conversation addresses speakers' personal identity
   commitments), may be implicated in the emergence of these patterns.
   Moreover, we show how the patterns in turn enact multiplicity and
   singularity in expressions of organizational identity within situated
   interactions.},

Title = {Absorptive Resisting Work: How the yellow vests deployed resistance to
   and through violence},
Journal = {ORGANIZATION STUDIES},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {45},
Number = {3},
Pages = {433-456},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Organizational research has increasingly recognized violence as an
   instrument for achieving compliance and maintaining the existing order.
   However, resisters tend to be portrayed as powerless in the face of this
   violence or engaging in hopeless acts of resistance. In comparison, by
   examining the context of violent protests, this paper discusses how
   activists can endure and use violence as part of their resistance. I
   build on a 15-month ethnography of the gilets jaunes (yellow vest)
   movement to illuminate the absorptive resisting work involved in
   deploying resistance to and through violence. This absorptive resisting
   work included reducing the repressive effects of violent protests and
   embracing those effects to generate symbolic and discursive resources
   against police violence, as well as including violent protest tactics in
   ways that regenerated those resources. Ultimately, my findings reveal
   that this absorptive work allowed resisters to withstand violent
   protests in the short term and reframe them in the long term. This paper
   thus contributes to studies on resistance to violence by showing how
   people can effectively and collectively catalyze violence to challenge
   it.},

Title = {How workplace identities and team management practices affect
   distributed team auditors' willingness to speak up},
Journal = {CONTEMPORARY ACCOUNTING RESEARCH},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {41},
Number = {1},
Pages = {562-590},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Distributed, rather than co-located, teams increasingly perform audit
   work, raising regulator concerns that distributed team communication
   issues may affect audit quality. We investigate upward communication
   (i.e., raising issues to supervisors), a key communication dimension
   related to audit quality. In Study 1, we survey 69 senior auditors to
   establish that distributed team upward communication suffers.
   Furthermore, distributed team auditors identify less with their teams
   and struggle to know when and how to speak up. Because both are linked
   to inhibited upward communication, we next experimentally test firm
   practices with the potential to attenuate these problems. Study 2, an
   experiment with 128 staff auditors and interns, reveals that making
   auditors' professional identities salient improves upward communication
   on co-located teams with strong team identities but not on distributed
   teams with weak team identities. Study 3, an experiment with 58 staff
   auditors, replicates a key Study 2 finding with a design that makes no
   reference to team identity strength. Specifically, in the presence of a
   salient professional identity, upward communication is significantly
   higher for co-located relative to distributed team auditors. Study 4, an
   experiment with 69 staff auditors, focuses solely on distributed teams.
   It indicates that several distributed team management practices,
   including one-on-one and standing daily meetings, encourage upward
   communication. Finally, Study 5, informal interviews with eight audit
   seniors, corroborates key survey and experimental findings. Combined,
   our results provide insights into why distributed team communication
   suffers, refine audit voice theory, and provide regulators,
   practitioners, and researchers with multiple paths to improve audit
   quality.
   Comment l'identite en milieu de travail et les pratiques de gestion des
   equipes influencent la volonte de prendre position des auditeurs qui
   travaillent en equipes disperseesDe plus en plus, les audits sont
   realises par des equipes d'auditeurs geographiquement disperses, plutot
   que par des auditeurs travaillant tous au meme endroit, ce qui amene les
   organismes de reglementation a s'inquieter de la possibilite que les
   enjeux de communication rencontres par les equipes dispersees nuisent a
   la qualite des audits. Nous nous penchons sur la communication
   ascendante (c.-a-d., aviser les superviseurs des problemes), qui
   represente un aspect cle de la communication en ce qui a trait a la
   qualite de l'audit. Lors de la 1re etude, nous interrogeons 69 auditeurs
   principaux pour montrer que la communication ascendante presente des
   lacunes dans les equipes dispersees. De plus, les auditeurs des equipes
   dispersees s'identifient moins a leur equipe et ont de la difficulte a
   savoir quand et comment prendre la parole. Puisque ces deux problemes
   sont lies a l'inefficacite de la communication ascendante, nous testons
   ensuite de facon experimentale les pratiques en entreprise qui
   pourraient les attenuer. La 2e etude, une experience menee aupres de 128
   auditeurs et stagiaires travaillant dans des entreprises, revele que la
   mise en valeur de l'identite professionnelle des auditeurs ameliore la
   communication ascendante au sein des equipes regroupees au meme endroit
   et ayant une solide identite collective, mais pas dans les equipes
   dispersees qui presentent une faible identite collective. La 3e etude
   realisee aupres de 58 auditeurs en entreprise reproduit un des
   principaux resultats de la 2e etude en evitant toute reference a la
   solidite de l'identite collective. Plus precisement, lorsque l'identite
   professionnelle est mise en valeur, la communication ascendante est
   significativement plus soutenue pour les equipes d'auditeurs travaillant
   au meme endroit que pour les equipes dispersees. La 4e etude, une
   experience conduite aupres de 69 auditeurs d'entreprises, s'attarde
   seulement aux equipes dispersees. Elle etablit que plusieurs pratiques
   de gestion de ce type d'equipes, y compris les rencontres individuelles
   et les reunions quotidiennes continues, favorisent la communication
   ascendante. Enfin, la 5e etude, qui repose sur des entretiens
   individuels avec huit auditeurs principaux, corrobore les resultats cles
   de nos questionnaires et experiences. Ensemble, nos resultats
   fournissent des indications sur les raisons pour lesquelles la
   communication ascendante est entravee dans les equipes dispersees,
   precisent la theorie des voix de l'audit et proposent aux organismes de
   reglementation, aux praticiens et aux chercheurs diverses pistes pour
   ameliorer la qualite des audits.},

Abstract = {Tedious work is pervasive in creative work, yet it has received little
   attention in the literature on creativity, including studies of science,
   innovation, and product development. Drawing from a comparative
   ethnography of two settings-systems biology and music production-we
   illuminate tedious work as an essential, previously under-investigated
   aspect of creative work that becomes increasingly prominent with
   digitization. Tedious work is repetitive, detail-oriented, and
   expertise-based, and we classify four types of it: fishing,
   administrating, polishing, and compiling. We develop a model of how
   tedious work emerges, why it becomes problematic, and what actors do to
   reduce its negative effects. Tedious work presents three risks to
   developing viable, novel outcomes-time drain, disengagement, and
   information overload-and we identify tactics that actors use to mitigate
   these risks and support individual creativity and the collective
   creative process. By unpacking the central notion of iteration and
   documenting the repercussions of creating novel outcomes with
   digitization, specifically the potential to amplify tedious work, we
   provide an important counterpoint to voices that hail digital
   technology's low cost and unlimited potential for iteration and
   refinement.},

Abstract = {We study shareholder voting in a model in which trading affects the
   composition of the shareholder base. Trading and voting are
   complementary, which gives rise to self-fulfilling expectations about
   proposal acceptance and multiple equilibria. Prices and shareholder
   welfare can move in opposite directions, so the former may be an invalid
   proxy for the latter. Relaxing trading frictions can reduce welfare
   because it allows extreme shareholders to gain more weight in voting.
   Delegating decision-making to the board can help overcome collective
   action problems at the voting stage. We also analyze the role of index
   investors and social concerns of shareholders.},

Title = {How Culture Displaced Structural Reform: Problem Definition,
   Marketization, and Neoliberal Myths in Bank Regulation},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ETHICS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {193},
Number = {2},
Pages = {303-323},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {We use content analysis to show that the diagnosis of the financial
   crisis of 2007-2009 shifted significantly from a focus on the need for
   structural change in the banking industry to an emphasis on culture and
   reform at the organizational level. We consider four overlapping
   subsystems in which this shift in problem-solution clusters played
   out-political, regulatory, legal, and consulting-and show that the
   ``structural reform agenda,{''} which was initially strong and publicly
   prominent in the political arena, lost attention. Over time it was
   displaced by a neoliberal managerialist turn, which watered down or
   abandoned structural solutions and instead played up a new ``culture and
   conduct reform agenda.{''} We explain this shift in terms of the
   marketization of regulation, which-following Mautner (Language and the
   market society, 1st ed. Routledge, 2010)'s model of interdiscursive
   alignment-we detect in the shifting language of financial-services
   reform across the four subsystems in scope. We argue that a neoliberal
   turn took place with a discursive closure that made the structural
   reform alternative gradually unsayable and, in the end, unthinkable. At
   the same time, the discourse turned to embrace the neoliberal agenda,
   built on the myth of self-regulating actors and markets, manifest in the
   culture problematic. This managerialist turn was able to mobilise, and
   be operationalised by, an industry of consultants, whereas structural
   change came to be seen by regulators as too risky to implement. We claim
   that these dynamics reveal how a form of ``collective strategic
   ignorance,{''} based on powerful institutional myths, was systematically
   oriented to ignore and reject structural sources of crisis. Finally, we
   suggest that the observed pattern of displacement-whereby initial calls
   for structural change become later displaced by managerial and
   procedural solutions-is common to other social issues, such as audit
   reform and corporate social responsibility.},

   and Rebalancing Options},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MARKETING},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {88},
Number = {3},
Pages = {29-49},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {This article analyzes the nature and temporal change of conceptual
   contributions in marketing scholarship with two complementary studies.
   First, based on a computer-aided text analysis of 5,922 articles
   published in the four major marketing journals between 1990 and 2021,
   the authors analyze how conceptual contributions have changed over time
   using the MacInnis (2011) framework. Results indicate that over the past
   three decades, theorizing efforts have strongly favored
   ``envisioning{''} and ``explicating{''} at the expense of ``relating{''}
   and ``debating,{''} with this imbalance increasing over time. Second,
   the authors draw on 48 in-depth interviews with editors, department
   heads, and authors to validate these patterns and uncover the underlying
   mechanisms. The findings indicate that a prevalent thought style has
   developed in the field-defined by the research ideals of novelty,
   clarity, and quantification-that shapes the collective view of how
   marketing scholars, in their roles as authors, reviewers, and mentors,
   can make a valuable contribution to marketing scholarship. This thought
   style favors envisioning and explicating contributions and disfavors
   relating and debating contributions. Jointly, the two studies point to
   several rebalancing options that can reinvigorate relating and debating
   contributions while preserving the current strengths of the marketing
   field.},

Title = {Exposure to the Views of Opposing Others with Latent Cognitive
   Differences Results in Social Influence-But Only When Those Differences
   Remain Obscured},
Journal = {MANAGEMENT SCIENCE},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 NOV 15},
Abstract = {Cognitive differences can catalyze social learning through the process
   of one-toone social influence. Yet the learning benefits of exposure to
   the ideas of cognitively dissimilar others often fail to materialize.
   Why do cognitive differences produce learning from interpersonal
   influence in some contexts but not in others? To answer this question,
   we distinguish between cognition that is expressed-one's public stance
   on an issue and the way in which supporting arguments are framed-and
   cognition that is latent-the semantic associations that underpin these
   expressions. We theorize that, when latent cognition is obscured, one is
   more likely to be influenced to change one's mind on an issue when
   exposed to the opposing ideas of cognitively dissimilar, rather than
   similar, others. When latent cognition is instead observable, a subtle
   similarity-attraction response tends to counteract the potency of
   cognitive differences-even when social identity cues and other
   categorical distinctions are inaccessible. To evaluate these ideas, we
   introduce a novel experimental paradigm in which participants (a)
   respond to a polarizing scenario; (b) view an opposing argument by
   another whose latent cognition is either similar to or different from
   their own and is either observable or obscured; and (c) have an
   opportunity to respond again to the scenario. A preregistered study (n =
   1,000) finds support for our theory. A supplemental study (n = 200)
   suggests that the social influence of latent cognitive differences
   operates through the mechanism of argument novelty. We discuss
   implications of these findings for research on social influence,
   collective intelligence, and cognitive diversity in groups.},

Title = {Collective Creativity and Innovation: An Interdisciplinary Review,
   Integration, and Research Agenda},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 NOV 14},
Abstract = {Collective creativity and innovation are key determinants of various
   important outcomes ranging from competitiveness of an organization to
   GDP growth of a country. As a result, this topic has attracted
   widespread scholarly interest from different disciplines, including
   strategic management, entrepreneurship, production and operations
   management, information systems, marketing, organizational behavior,
   sociology, economics, and psychology. However, this research remained
   isolated within disciplinary boundaries, which presents a major barrier
   for knowledge accumulation and cross-disciplinary learning. In this
   review, building on a new taxonomy of collectivity, we develop an
   integrative framework that organizes and synthesizes the fragmented
   research on the topic. The framework shows how antecedents related to
   the cognitive, social, and organizational architecture of a collective
   impact innovation depending on the collectivity type: attention-based,
   divergence-based, and convergence-based collectives. As a whole, our
   framework builds an integrative understanding of drivers of collective
   creativity and innovation and sets the stage for further theory
   development by facilitating communication across different disciplines.
   We conclude our review with an agenda for future research.},

Journal = {MANAGEMENT SCIENCE},

Abstract = {The trust game, a simple two-player economic exchange, is extensively
   used as an experimental measure for trust and trustworthiness of
   individuals. We construct deep neural network-based artificial
   intelligence (AI) agents to participate a series of experiments based
   upon the trust game. These artificial agents are trained by playing with
   one another repeatedly without any prior knowledge, assumption, or data
   regarding human behaviors. We find that, under certain conditions, AI
   agents produce actions that are qualitatively similar to decisions of
   human subjects reported in the trust game literature. Factors that
   influence the emergence and levels of cooperation by artificial agents
   in the game are further explored. This study offers evidence that AI
   agents can develop trusting and cooperative behaviors purely from an
   interactive trial-and-error learning process. It constitutes a first
   step to build multiagent-based decision support systems in which
   interacting artificial agents are capable of leveraging social
   intelligence to achieve better outcomes collectively.},

   approach to employee development},
Journal = {ORGANIZATIONAL BEHAVIOR AND HUMAN DECISION PROCESSES},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {180},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Reflecting trends in society, organizations are seeking to embrace
   personal distinctiveness and self-expression among their members. Doing
   so is more complicated than meets the eye, however. By its very nature,
   personal identity is complex and dynamic. As such, people often lack a
   comprehensive understanding of who they are. Here, I theorize that
   organizations can navigate this challenge by inviting their members to
   undergo a novel method of employee development - one designed to produce
   sudden, personally transformational realizations, or epiphanies.
   Organizations can promote and, in turn, support epiphanies through a
   range of practices that open people to the prospect of
   self-transformation and activate the psychological processes by which
   epiphanies arise. For these practices to prove effective, however,
   organizations must avoid the missteps identified here. Collectively, my
   theoretical claims reveal how organizations can help their members gain
   self-insight - and why doing so can enhance their reputation and attract
   job seekers.},

   processes to steer organizational actors toward addressing the elusive
   question of ``what is the right thing to do?{''} in specific situations.
   However, the interplay between these prescriptive frameworks and
   collective processes of ethical sensemaking remains underexplored. Based
   on an extensive qualitative study within publicly funded healthcare
   organizations, we examine how organizational actors, confronted with the
   challenge of making exceptional funding decisions, enact an
   organizational ethical framework. Our findings reveal the manifold ways
   through which such a framework both streamlines ethical sensemaking and
   induces new and unexpected interpretive challenges. These challenges
   generate ethical equivocality, which decision makers seek to reduce
   through particular sensegiving interventions, and, on occasion, through
   problematizing the abstract principles prescribed by the framework,
   based on what is intuitively felt right in situ. We contribute to the
   literature by developing a conceptual model of three distinct modes in
   which organizational actors enact the prescriptions of an ethical
   framework. Our article sheds new light on the unintended consequences of
   using organizational ethical frameworks in real-world ethical
   deliberations.},

Title = {Food for thought: How curiosity externalization is fostered through

Journal = {ORGANIZATIONAL BEHAVIOR AND HUMAN DECISION PROCESSES},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {179},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Curiosity has increasingly been deemed to hold pivotal influence over
   the ventures founders create. While this growing body of knowledge has
   helped us understand the origins of a venture, what is less well
   understood is the process by which individual curiosity gets
   externalized to the organizational level. Yet, the externalization of
   curiosity has been recognized as central for rallying organizational
   members behind innovation initiatives. To understand how curiosity
   externalizes and thereby translates into a venture's collective
   property, we conducted an in-depth case study of Rasmus Munk and his two
   Michelin-starred restaurant Alchemist. Our empirically grounded process
   model draws attention to the pivotal role identity mechanisms assume in
   externalizing curi-osity in a venture: Promoting originality through
   de-familiarizing the familiar at the individual level is
   counter-balanced by familiarizing the unfamiliar into a coherent venture
   story at the organizational level.},

   Capital Market Incentives?},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ETHICS},

Abstract = {We examine whether gender-diverse boards prioritize product market
   concerns over capital market incentives when proprietary costs are high.
   We argue that gender-diverse boards protect their firm's competitive
   edge and maximize long-term shareholder wealth by ethically and
   carefully maintaining the confidentiality of proprietary information.
   Due to the reduced disclosure of proprietary information, firms with
   gender-diverse boards are likely to face more adverse selection when
   proprietary costs are high. However, the reduced disclosure of
   proprietary information enables firms with gender-diverse boards to
   enhance and maintain their competitive edge and gain higher long-term
   returns. Using a matched sample of the United States-listed companies,
   we find that firms with gender-diverse boards, relative to similar firms
   with all-male boards, (1) are associated with higher adverse selection
   costs and (2) higher long-run stock returns when the firm faces high
   product market competition. Collectively, our results suggest that firms
   with gender-diverse boards, which initially experience higher adverse
   selection in a competitive environment, are rewarded with a net gain of
   about 10 percent of their stock price in three years. Our research
   contributes to the literature by highlighting the importance of board
   gender diversity in fostering the ethical redaction of proprietary
   information for proprietary cost-based motives as opposed to agency
   cost-based motives. Our findings have important implications for
   regulators, firms, and shareholders by identifying gender-diverse boards
   as an antecedent for the ethical redaction of proprietary information.},

Title = {It's a matter of style: The role of audit firms and audit partners in
   key audit matter reporting},
Journal = {CONTEMPORARY ACCOUNTING RESEARCH},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {41},
Number = {1},
Pages = {529-561},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {We examine the relative importance of audit firm versus partner decision
   styles in key audit matter (KAM) reporting. Standard setters intended
   KAMs to increase the usefulness of the audit report by requiring the
   partner-led engagement team to disclose engagement-specific information
   about the most significant judgments they made during the audit.
   However, stakeholders expressed widespread concern that audit firms'
   longstanding efforts toward standardization would result in generic KAMs
   at the audit firm level and provide partners little opportunity or
   incentive for engagement-specific reporting. We evaluate this
   high-stakes tension between standard setters' goals for audit reporting
   and auditors' deep-rooted practices by leveraging data from the United
   Kingdom, which has required partner identification since 2009 and
   expanded audit reports since 2013. We find that clients sharing the same
   partner receive KAMs that are 10\% more textually similar than clients
   with different partners. In contrast, clients sharing the same audit
   firm receive KAMs that are just 2\% more textually similar than clients
   with different audit firms. This implies that partner decision styles
   are more important in influencing KAM outcomes than audit firm styles.
   Collectively, our results suggest that partners make unique KAM
   reporting judgments, countering concerns that audit firms' efforts
   toward standardization will yield boilerplate KAMs. This evidence
   extends the literature on expanded audit reporting and partner decision
   styles and provides valuable insights into a contemporary issue in audit
   regulation with broader implications for understanding dynamics within
   the profession.},

Abstract = {Organizations have increasingly relied on virtual teams (VTs). For VTs
   to succeed, the collaborative behavior of team members plays an
   important role. Drawing from the open systems theory and using a
   phenomenon-driven approach, we investigate the dynamic pattern of
   collaborative behavior convergence among members of VTs (i.e., the
   emergence of collaborative behavior consensus) and its relationship with
   VT performance. Moreover, we investigate the differential influence of
   external crises, exemplified by key dynamic facets of the COVID-19
   crisis (i.e., COVID-19 health threat and social distance). We used a
   multilevel approach (i.e., time, individual, and team levels) with the
   multilevel group-process framework to test our hypotheses. Results from
   a survey of 3,506 participants nested in 703 teams suggest that
   collaborative behaviors of VT members tend to converge over time,
   leading to the emergence of collaborative behavior consensus.
   Furthermore, a dynamic COVID-19 health threat leads to lower
   collaborative behavior consensus over time. Moreover, our results show
   that collaborative behavior consensus is partially positively related to
   VT performance and is particularly important for VTs with a lower level
   of collaborative behavior at the end of the collaboration. The practical
   and theoretical implications of these findings are discussed.},

Abstract = {We offer a critical inquiry into the faltering entry of an
   anthropomorphised AI (ro)bot, an algorithm without physical or visual
   form, into the workplace in a media consultancy company. While living a
   digital life in the virtual world, the ro(bot) was given a human name.
   We highlight the unexpected consequences the humanisation of an early
   form of artificial intelligence (AI) has on the affects circulating
   between people and the new technology and between members of different
   organisational groups. We argue that anthropomorphising technologies
   such as AI influences the affective life of organisations and amplifies
   existing discontent between organisational members, complicating the
   introduction of the technology. Focusing on human-AI interaction, our
   analysis reveals a rift between managers who are excited and hopeful
   about the future capabilities of AI and employees who are frustrated and
   angry about its present shortcomings. We conclude that collective
   affects play a central role in contemporary technology-driven
   organisations in which the role people play in relation to the avalanche
   of AI technologies is often neglected.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF FINANCIAL AND QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 OCT 31},
Abstract = {Firms falling short of earnings expectations are more likely to cite
   stakeholder-focused objectives in their public communications following
   earnings announcements. This behavior is consistent with managers
   preferring to be evaluated by subjective stakeholder-based performance
   criteria when falling short on objective shareholder-based measures.
   This increased use of stakeholder language is most evident among firms
   narrowly missing earnings estimates and appears unrelated to a firm's
   actual environmental, social, and governance (ESG)-related activity.
   Stakeholder language appears to influence the evaluation of CEOs;
   turnover-performance sensitivity is lower for managers citing
   stakeholder value. Collectively, our findings are consistent with
   concerns that stakeholder objectives reduce managerial accountability

Abstract = {We investigate organizational members' crisis sensemaking and
   construction of responsibility at the peak of a corporate scandal. We
   focus on those organizational members, who are not directly involved in
   the scandal but are still affected by it, as they are questioned about
   their collective and moral responsibility for being members of an
   organization that has engaged in wrongdoing. Our study is based on
   interviews with and observations of frontline employees and their
   managers at Danske Banke-a bank involved in a money laundering scandal
   of historical magnitude. We propose an antenarrative crisis sensemaking
   framework that enables us to contribute to the literature on crisis
   sensemaking in two significant ways. First, we advance existing
   knowledge on crisis sensemaking by focusing on the less visible,
   unfinished, fragmented, and polyphonic sensemaking of organizational
   members during a corporate scandal. Second, we demonstrate that
   organizational members at the peak of a scandal place responsibility in
   different timespaces as they construct others' and their own
   responsibility both retrospectively and prospectively.},

Abstract = {Research Summary: With over a billion people inhabiting informal
   settlements worldwide, micro-entrepreneurs are vital to local economies.
   Complementary currencies have emerged as tools to sustain these
   entrepreneurs, providing alternative trading and payment options. This
   study explores the daily strategies of micro-entrepreneurs in Kenyan
   informal settlements using the digital complementary currency Sarafu.
   Our findings reveal that complementary currencies act as external
   enablers, transforming the local economies by enhancing payment systems,
   influencing supply and demand, and altering pricing structures.
   Significantly, when integrated with savings groups, they provide
   financial inclusion and collective purpose, strengthening local business
   networks. This research enriches our understanding of the mechanisms
   micro-entrepreneurs deploy to leverage complementary currencies for
   growth, emphasizing the need for further exploration into the role of
   complementary currencies in supporting entrepreneurship.Managerial
   Summary: This study explores how a complementary currency called Sarafu
   benefits micro-entrepreneurs in Kenyan informal settlements. Sarafu acts
   as catalysts for entrepreneurship by boosting local markets and
   empowering community cooperation. Our findings reveal that
   micro-entrepreneurs use Sarafu to adapt to the unique challenges of
   informal economies. They employ smart strategies like flexible pricing
   and inventory management to keep Sarafu flowing smoothly. Sarafu serves
   a dual purpose: a means of immediate spending and a tool for saving and
   growing capital. It also strengthens local business networks and creates
   a sense of collective purpose. For practitioners, this study suggests
   using complementary currencies to support local business networks,
   promote collective savings, and align the issuance of complementary
   currencies with local assets to foster sustainable entrepreneurship in
   informal economies.},

Title = {Corporate Responses to Social Activism: A Review and Research Agenda},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 OCT 31},
Abstract = {We take a process perspective to review the literature on corporate
   responses to social activism and argue that theoretical advances have
   not kept pace with the extensive and expanding scope of the literature.
   We identify three critical assumptions in the literature, which we
   believe can be traced back to two overarching issues: a mechanistic
   conceptualization that ascribes limited reflexivity to managers and an
   overreliance on variance theorizing. In order to tackle these challenges
   and propel future research, we suggest a research agenda that revolves
   around an enhanced role for managerial reflexivity in theory development
   and a stronger emphasis on the process-oriented view of the relationship
   between activism and response.},

Abstract = {We examine the relation between voluntary disclosure and the value of
   analysts' research by studying the change in the informativeness of
   analysts' research after managers stop providing quarterly guidance to
   investors. We find that the market reaction to analysts' recommendation
   revisions increases significantly after guidance stoppage, controlling
   for confounding factors as well as for firm and time fixed effects. The
   increase in market reaction is greater for firms with more opaque
   information environments and for firms that previously provided
   disaggregated guidance. Further, the effect of guidance stoppage on the
   informativeness of analysts' research reverses after managers resume
   guidance. Finally, textual analyses of analysts' reports before and
   after guidance stoppage reveal that analysts issue longer, more
   frequent, and more detailed reports that convey more forward-looking
   information after stoppages. These findings collectively shed light on
   the relation between the supply of voluntary disclosure and the value
   that sell-side analysts add to price discovery in capital markets.},

Title = {Guardians of Trust: How Review Platforms Can Fight Fakery and Build
   Consumer Trust},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {61},
Number = {4, SI},
Pages = {682-699},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {As customers increasingly rely on online reviews for making consumption
   decisions, the dangers arising from misinformation and fakery have
   become an acute source of concern for consumers, firms, and society at
   large. Many online review platforms claim a role as guardians of trust
   in the information exchange process. Yet, little is known about the
   practices firms can utilize to design platforms that build and safeguard
   consumer trust. The authors draw on governance and identity disclosure
   literature streams to propose five practices that mitigate fakery and
   build trust in the platform: monitoring, exposure, community building,
   status endowment, and identity disclosure. Five studies (1) establish
   the individual and joint effects these practices have on platform trust,
   (2) identify the mediating processes by which the practices build trust,
   (3) verify the ecological value of the conceptual framework, (4) provide
   support of the salience of the practices, and (5) show how the practices
   build trust above and beyond review content-level characteristics.
   Interaction effects suggest that exposure, community building, and
   status endowment obviate the need for identity disclosure in building
   platform trust, a finding that mitigates related privacy concerns.
   Collectively, the findings can improve platform design, enabling review
   platforms to fulfill their promise of mitigating fakery and increasing
   trust.},

Title = {Prefiguring Alternative Organizing: Confronting marginalization through
   projective cultural adjustment and tempered autonomy},
Journal = {ORGANIZATION STUDIES},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {45},
Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {59-84},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {In this paper, we examine community collectives - place-based,
   community-led initiatives for sustainable livelihood, as an alternative
   to the top-down, efficiency-driven economic model. Drawing on the
   theoretical framework of prefigurative organizing, we examined the
   strategies employed by community members in confronting entrenched
   inequalities and overcoming marginalization as they envision and engage
   in inclusive futures. We conducted a comparative case study of two
   exemplary community collectives in India that exhibited differences in
   the degrees of internal and external marginalization. We identified two
   key cross-cutting themes of prefigurative organizing: projective
   cultural adjustment - whether a community leverages their traditional
   culture or breaks away from it, and tempered autonomy - negotiating
   autonomy without overtly challenging dominant groups, and exercising
   self-imposed restraints to make independent decisions. We show how these
   two themes manifested across three key processes of prefigurative
   organizing: prefiguring self-governance; commoning; and cultivating
   discursive spaces. These findings help us theorize that in communities
   where the degree of internal marginalization is high due to persisting
   social hierarchies, breaking away from past discriminatory practices,
   incorporating suspension of consent in the decision-making process, and
   introducing multiple constructive works are essential components of
   prefigurative organizing. In communities where the degree of external
   marginalization is high, building on the past, incorporating refusal in
   decision-making, and introducing unified constructive work are important
   components of prefigurative organizing. We suggest that prefigurative
   organizing against the dominant power structure, whether within
   community social hierarchies or external exploitative political-economic
   structures, is based on selective and strategic engagement without
   seeking an exit, as exit might not be an option for place-based
   communities. We discuss the theoretical and practical implications of
   this research for alternative organizing and grand challenges.},

Abstract = {Supporting the concept of DEI, yet, perturbed by the volatility that
   marks today's societal and professional climate, the authors of this
   article examined three Eastern spiritual traditions in search of common
   guidelines addressing contemporary issues related to social unrest,
   imbued by inequity and injustice. The areas of review included Buddhist
   psychology, with some of its foundational concepts such as the Four
   Noble Truths and the Noble Eightfold Path, the concept of ahimsa
   (non-harming), and the understanding of the impermanence of everything
   as inclusive managerial practices; Daoist philosophy, with its
   observations of oneness and equality, and holistic self-alignment with
   virtue through practicing tranquility; and Hinduism, which focuses on
   the absence of distinction between ourselves and others around us, thus
   forming the foundation for morality and ethical behavior with its
   emphasis on unity in diversity. This collective investigative journey
   has led us to gather some powerful common behavioral and ethical
   guidelines, to steer away managers from hyperindividualism and
   self-centeredness to a greater and consistent respect for the unity

Abstract = {Relying on their history of legal infractions to measure individuals'
   risk tolerance, we examine the association between engagement partners'
   risk appetites and audit quality in the United States. Criminology and
   economics research links infraction activity with enduring personality
   traits that capture an individual's risk tolerance. Our evidence
   supports the prediction that partners known to engage in risky
   off-the-job behaviors conduct lower quality audits. Specifically, we
   find that clients of partners with prior legal infractions exhibit a
   higher likelihood of material misstatements revealed through subsequent
   restatements, greater propensity to misstate based on the F-score, more
   instances of ``missed{''} material weaknesses, and less timely loss
   recognition, while also paying lower audit fees. In cross-sectional
   results consistent with expectations, we generally find that the impact
   of partners' risk tolerance on audit quality is more heavily
   concentrated in clients of non-Big 4 firms and offices without industry
   expertise. Collectively, our analysis contributes to emerging research
   on the role that individual partner characteristics play in shaping
   audit outcomes.},

Title = {Racial Discrimination and Anti-discrimination: The COVID-19 Pandemic's
   Impact on Chinese Restaurants in North America},
Journal = {INFORMATION SYSTEMS RESEARCH},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {35},
Number = {3},
Pages = {1274-1295},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has led to an increase
   in cases of racial discrimination against Asians, especially Chinese
   people. Despite an emerging stream of studies investigating various
   aspects of the COVID-19 pandemic, research on the behavioral
   consequences of racial discrimination during the pandemic remains
   scarce. In this work, we examined how racial discrimination stemming
   from the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent anti-discrimination were
   manifested on online platforms. By combining difference-in-differences
   analyses on two large-scale panel data sets from Yelp.com and SafeGraph
   and two controlled experiments, we explored the impact of COVID-19 on
   Chinese restaurants relative to non-Chinese restaurants at different
   phases of the COVID19 pandemic. We found that the COVID-19 pandemic led
   to an immediate increase in racial discrimination, which was reflected
   in a significant drop in the customer patronage frequency of Chinese
   restaurants as compared with that of non-Chinese restaurants.
   Furthermore, analyses using multiple behavioral indicators generated by
   text mining and machine learning techniques consistently suggested that
   increased discrimination triggered anti-discrimination actions of
   customers on online platforms after the COVID-19 outbreak. This study
   contributes to the literature on racial discrimination by investigating
   a subtle but more factual form of racial discrimination evidenced by the
   customer patronage of Chinese restaurants as well as user-generated
   content by demonstrating that consumers can fight discrimination on
   online platforms.},

Title = {Assembling a Zero-Waste World: From situated to distributed
   prefiguration},
Journal = {ORGANIZATION STUDIES},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {45},
Number = {2},
Pages = {297-318},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The concept of prefiguration is drawing increasing interest as a lens to
   study the collective dynamic and transformative potential of alternative
   organizing. We introduce an analytical distinction between two modes of
   prefiguration. Situated prefiguration emphasizes affective bonds and
   direct struggle taking place in bounded organizational spaces, while
   distributed prefiguration manifests in wider socio-spatial formations.
   While situated prefiguration has been studied substantially, distributed
   prefiguration has so far not been adequately theorized. To conceptualize
   more spatially dispersed forms of prefiguration, we approach
   prefiguration from a relational perspective, drawing especially on
   assemblage thinking, which reveals a different way of thinking about how
   prefigurative practices are spatially organized. We demonstrate
   different socio-spatial forms of prefiguration in action through an
   empirical investigation of the zero-waste phenomenon. Our empirical
   material is built on site visits to zero-waste stores, interviews with
   zero-wasters and conventional retailers and online sources related to
   zero-waste. We find that zero-waste stores transcend situated
   prefiguration by being part of a zero-waste assemblage that aims to
   radically transform the food and retail system through distributed
   prefiguration.},

Title = {The interplay of gender and perceived sexual orientation at the
   bargaining table: A social dominance and intersectionalist perspective},
Journal = {ORGANIZATIONAL BEHAVIOR AND HUMAN DECISION PROCESSES},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {179},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Prior research suggests that female negotiators often obtain worse
   outcomes than male negotiators. The current research examines whether
   this pattern extends to the large subset of men and women who identify
   as gays and lesbians. In particular, we interweave scholarship on gender
   stereotypes with work on intersectionality and MOSAIC theory to develop
   a theoretical model that anticipates how male and female negotiators
   will be treated at the bargaining table based on whether they are
   perceived to be heterosexual or homosexual. This model predicts that
   homosexual women, like heterosexual men, will receive more beneficial
   negotiation offers and outcomes than heterosexual women and homosexual
   men. Additionally, it suggests that this will happen because people hold
   markedly different behavioral expectations for male and female
   heterosexual and homosexual negotiators. The results of five
   experimental and audit studies involving diverse samples of participants
   including Masters Students in the U.S. and India, individuals selling
   items on Craigslist, and street vendors in India provide robust support.
   Collectively, these findings highlight the importance of considering
   gender and sexual orientation in tandem when studying negotiation.},

Abstract = {We theorize that ally work (actions by employees belonging to advantaged
   social groups to support employees belonging to disadvantaged social
   groups) can be organized into three modalities: self ally work that is
   oriented toward developing skills and capabilities, relational ally work
   that is focused on building positive work relationships, and
   organizational ally work aimed at changing organizational practices to
   support disadvantaged coworkers. Drawing from the theory of political
   ideology as motivated cognition, across multiple pre-registered field
   studies we found that employees who were more liberal-leaning (vs.
   conservative-leaning) reported higher engagement in all three
   modalities. We also examined whether contextual affordances amplified
   the liberalism effect. Specifically, we tested whether personal
   accountability for diversity, colleague diversity, and organizational
   ideology directed liberals toward greater engagement in self,
   relational, and organizational work, respectively. As hypothesized, more
   liberal-leaning employees reported higher engagement in organizational
   ally work in more ideologically liberal organizations. However, the
   hypothesized effects of personal accountability were not supported.
   Notably, personal accountability had a positive effect on self ally work
   among more conservative-leaning employees. The moderating effects of
   colleague diversity were also mixed across studies. Highlighting both
   the plurality and politics of ally work, we discuss theoretical and
   practical implications of our findings.},

Year = {2023},
Volume = {48},
Number = {4},
Pages = {681-696},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Management and organization studies have long been interested in the
   social contexts and enduring consequences of individual and collective
   action. Yet, empirically observing both the situated nature of actions
   and their ultimate consequences remains challenging. In this paper, we
   describe microhistory as a complementary approach to grounded and
   longitudinal studies that reconciles situated action in time with its
   broader consequences over time. Microhistorical research involves the
   reflexive use of dual temporal frames: a microtemporal frame suited to
   an empirically grounded study of individuals in time and a macrotemporal
   frame accounting for processes of continuity and change in social
   structures over time. We describe the epistemology, method, and form
   inherent in theorizing with microhistory and consider its potential for
   management researchers. Microhistory's approach, we recognize, is
   well-suited to several phenomena that remain elusive to contemporaneous
   and longitudinal studies, such as exceptional normal actions, unintended
   consequences, nonlinear and emergent processes, contingent processes,
   and unobserved or inconceivable processes. Finally, we consider how
   microhistory's reflexive temporality offers management scholars
   opportunities to situate ourselves and our own theorizing in time and to
   account for evolving consequences over time.},

Journal = {ACADEMY OF MANAGEMENT REVIEW},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {48},
Number = {4},
Pages = {611-638},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Paradoxical leadership-the integration of leadership behaviors that are
   seemingly contradictory, but nevertheless interdependent-is becoming
   increasingly important in today's complex and turbulent business
   environments. Despite evidence for the positive consequences of
   paradoxical leadership, little research has examined how and when
   leaders can effectively integrate or reconcile opposing leadership
   behaviors. Two of the most fundamental paradoxical challenges that
   leaders face include the need to integrate control and empowerment, as
   well as reconciling collective rules with followers' individual needs.
   In this article, we advance a circadian theory of paradoxical leadership
   that outlines how leaders can combine episodic thinking with circadian
   principles to achieve a dynamic equilibrium between the opposing poles
   of these two leadership para-doxes. Our temporal framework explains how
   leaders can effectively structure paradoxical leadership episodes that
   leverage their own and their followers' circadian processes within a
   broader framework of situation-driven leadership. In doing so, we
   contribute to future research by providing a novel circadian perspective
   on how paradoxical tensions in organizations can be reconciled within
   the constraints of situational demands.},

Abstract = {We introduce new leader humility scales capturing a theoretically rich
   conceptualization of leader-expressed humility aligned with traditional
   and ethically-grounded philosophies. These scales draw from recent
   inductive research (Oc et al., 2015) identifying nine dimensions of
   leader-expressed humility: (1) having an accurate view of self, (2)
   recognizing follower strengths and achievements, (3) modeling
   teachability and being correctable, (4) leading by example, (5) showing
   modesty, (6) working together for the collective good, (7) empathy and
   approachability, (8) showing mutual respect and fairness, and (9)
   mentoring and coaching. The first three dimensions overlap with the most
   prominent conceptualization of leader-expressed humility in the
   literature (i.e., Owens et al., 2013). However, the latter six
   dimensions are unique and represent an expanded understanding of the
   humble behaviors of leaders, which have implications for leaders and
   their ethical behavior in organizations. We conducted three studies
   resulting in two versions of the leader-expressed humility measure: 1) a
   27-item scale with the nine dimensions (i.e., the ``Leader-Expressed
   Humility{''} {[}LEH] scale) and 2) a 9-item brief scale (i.e., the
   ``Brief LEH{''} scale) comprised of one item from each of the nine
   dimensions. As an initial step, we generated a pool of items that
   reflected each dimension. Next, we validated the LEH and Brief LEH
   scales in Study 1 and cross-validated the Brief LEH scale in Study 2
   with two samples of subordinates in Singapore. As a final step, in Study
   3, we cross-validated the Brief LEH scale with a sample of subordinates
   in the United States.},

Abstract = {Our research develops a framework that explores how to fuel the climate
   movement by accelerating grassroots, community-based climate action.
   Drawing on insights from consumer psychology, our framework identifies
   the psychological mechanisms that encourage and motivate people, both
   individually and collectively, to take climate action, thereby
   contributing to our understanding of how to advance social action and
   propel a social movement. Our climate action framework builds on: (1)
   individuals we describe as climate upstanders who rise up to take
   climate action with like-minded others, and (2) communities of climate
   upstanders who engage in collective action aimed at addressing the
   climate crisis. Our framework expands the field of consumer psychology
   by redefining the role of consumers to include the practice of social
   action and broadening the study of consumers to include collective,
   community-based action. We call on consumer psychologists to research
   individual and collective consumer practices related to social action
   and contribute to making social good central to the study of consumer
   psychology.},

Abstract = {Research SummaryRecently, the venture capital (VC) industry has
   experienced the entry of several new capital providers. Using US data on
   investors and their portfolio startups from 2000 to 2022, we document
   the emergence of a new type of investors: the micro VC. Our analysis
   reveals that micro Vencture Capitalists (VCs) have an idiosyncratic
   investment strategy, which differs from traditional VCs. Compared with
   these investors, micro VCs invest in riskier startups, that is,
   early-stage ventures initiated by less experienced founders; yet, micro
   VCs are less likely to syndicate, stage their investments, and replace
   the startup founders. Additionally, startups funded by micro VCs are
   less likely to experience successful exits than those backed by
   traditional VCs. These results can be traced to a mix of smaller capital
   endowments, less sophisticated limited partners, and lesser human
   capital of which micro VCs dispose, and that may induce them to spread
   their thin capital across many investments to maximize returns. Our
   analysis also uncovers important differences in the strategies pursued
   by micro VCs and business angels.Managerial SummaryThe VC industry is
   increasingly populated by a variety of investors with disparate
   characteristics and objectives. One such type of investors is
   represented by the so-called micro VC firms. These are VC firms that
   manage funds typically below \$50 million and focused primarily on
   investing in founder-led startups. We leverage comprehensive VC data in
   the United States to answer three questions: (1) Who leads micro VC
   firms? (2) How do micro VC firms invest? (3) How do startups backed by
   micro VC perform? We find that micro VC firms are often led by
   relatively inexperienced entrepreneurs with little VC experience, and
   these firms are supported by less sophisticated limited partners.
   Although micro VC firms invest in riskier startups, they are less
   engaged in syndication and investment staging than traditional VC firms.
   Finally, micro VC-backed startups have a lower probability of successful
   exit as compared with those backed by traditional VC firms.
   Collectively, our results suggest that micro VCs differ from traditional
   VCs beyond being ``micro.{''}},

Abstract = {We examine a regulatory change that increased the reporting frequency of
   mutual funds' portfolios. Using a difference-in-differences design, we
   find that firms with greater ownership by mutual funds increase share
   repurchases following the regulatory change. We show that these share
   repurchases are a firm's rational response to undervaluation, which
   occurs because fund managers become shortsighted following the
   regulation and sell companies with good long-term prospects.
   Collectively, our results shed light on an unintended consequence of
   more frequent reporting in a delegated asset management framework.

   augmente la frequence de la communication des rapports relatifs aux
   portefeuilles des societes d'investissement. A l'aide d'un modele en
   differences doubles, les auteurs constatent que les entreprises detenues
   en majorite par des societes d'investissement effectuent plus de rachats
   d'actions en reponse a la modification reglementaire. Ils montrent que
   ces rachats d'actions sont une reponse rationnelle d'une entreprise a la
   sous-evaluation de leurs actions, qui se produit parce que les
   gestionnaires de fonds developpent une vision a court terme a la suite
   de la reglementation et vendent des entreprises ayant de bonnes
   perspectives a long terme. Dans leur ensemble, les resultats mettent en

Abstract = {Managers often accompany salespeople to customer meetings, and their
   presence can be invaluable to the interaction. However, at times,
   managers may act in ways that are harmful rather than helpful. Scant
   scholarly attention has been allocated to understanding the dark side of
   managerial involvement. When negative manager behaviors manifest in
   customer-facing situations, salespeople must understand and mitigate
   these occurrences to prevent deleterious outcomes. This study conducts a
   qualitative inquiry of professional salespeople and organizational
   buyers to uncover the ways customer-facing adverse manager behaviors
   (CFAMBs) occur and affect sales calls. Specifically, manifestations of
   manager arrogance, apathy, and awkwardness can negatively affect
   customer outcomes. In addition, factors affecting the severity of
   CFAMBs' impact include timing in the sales cycle, customer status, and
   pre-, in-, and post-call mitigation strategies. Collectively, the
   findings advance role theory and theory germane to the salesperson-sales
   manager interface and provide practical guidance for dealing with
   CFAMBs.},

Title = {The impacts of lockdown on open source software contributions during the
   COVID-19 pandemic},
Journal = {RESEARCH POLICY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {52},
Number = {10},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic instigated widespread lockdowns, compelling
   millions to transition to work-from-home (WFH) arrangements and rely
   heavily on computer-mediated communications (CMC) for collaboration.
   This study examines the impacts of lockdown on innovation-driven work
   productivity, focusing on contributions to open source software (OSS)
   projects on GitHub, the world's largest OSS platform. By leveraging two
   lockdowns in China as natural experiments, we discover that developers
   in the 2021 Xi'an lockdown increased OSS contributions by 9.0 \%, while
   those in the 2020 Wuhan lockdown reduced their contributions by 10.5 \%.
   A subsequent survey study elucidates this divergence, uncovering an
   adaptation effect wherein Xi'an developers became more accustomed to the
   new norm of WFH over time, capitalizing on the flexibility and
   opportunities of remote work. Moreover, our findings across both
   lockdowns reveal that the lack of face-to-face (F2F) interactions
   significantly impeded OSS contributions, whereas the increased available
   time at home positively influenced them. This finding is especially
   noteworthy as it challenges the assumption that CMC can effortlessly
   substitute for F2F interactions without negatively affecting
   productivity. We further examine the impacts of stay-at-home orders in
   the United States (US) on OSS contributions and find no significant
   effects. Collectively, our research offers valuable insights into the
   multifaceted impacts of lockdown on productivity, shedding light on how
   individuals adapt to remote work norms during protracted disruptions
   like a pandemic. These insights provide various stakeholders, including
   individuals, organizations, and policymakers, with vital knowledge to
   prepare for future disruptions, foster sustainable resilience, and
   adeptly navigate the evolving landscape of remote work in a postpandemic
   world.},

Abstract = {The extant theory posits that ethno-racial diversity promotes
   entrepreneurship by increasing the novelty of information and
   perspectives available for recombination in a region. This view
   presupposes the flow of novel information among potential entrepreneurs.
   Yet, we know comparatively little about how regional social structures
   (e.g., collective social capital) that affect information flows
   condition this relationship. We build on the sociological literature to
   theorize how the interplay between collective social capital and
   residential segregation moderates the relationship between ethno-racial
   diversity and entrepreneurship. We test, and find empirical support for,
   our hypotheses among all registered new ventures started in the United
   States between 1990 and 2018.},

Abstract = {Modern asset pricing models combine recursive preferences with complex
   dynamics for the underlying consumption process. The existence of
   solutions is for many of these models an unsettled question. This paper
   introduces a novel technique to prove existence and nonexistence, as
   well as uniqueness for models with recursive preferences. The approach
   applies to many models of interest, including those with long-run
   consumption risks, with stochastic volatility and jumps, with
   time-varying consumption disasters, and with smooth ambiguity aversion
   and learning. Collectively, the proven results settle the existence
   question for many of today's leading asset pricing models.Authors have

   Evidence from US nonsmoking laws},
Journal = {RESEARCH POLICY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {52},
Number = {10},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {We use a natural experiment resulting from the staggered adoption of
   local workplace nonsmoking laws over the past fifty years to examine
   whether these public health policies also are associated with corporate
   innovation. We find a positive association between innovation and
   nonsmoking laws enacted near companies' headquarters locations,
   particularly in earlier years when smoking rates were highest. We use
   multiple difference-in-differences specifications, matched samples,
   companies headquartered in contiguous counties across state lines, and
   falsification tests to establish the robustness of the observed
   association and reduce the likelihood of alternative explanations. We
   then use an inductive approach to explore multiple potential mechanisms
   behind this correlation. We find evidence suggestive of the following
   mechanisms: improved health; improvements to employee creativity,
   productivity, and absenteeism; and increases in the local employee pool.
   Other mechanisms likely exist, but the collective evidence suggests that
   policy-based efforts to improve health are associated with a positive
   externality-increased corporate innovation.},

Title = {Enacting people analytics: Exploring the direct and complementary

Journal = {HUMAN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {63},
Number = {2},
Pages = {187-205},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Although research identifies analytical and storytelling skills as the
   two broad human capital inputs required to perform people analytics,
   further research is required to better understand how People Analysts
   that is, the enactors of people analytics, perceive the impact of these
   skills on their performance. Accordingly, this study draws on the human
   capital resource (HCR) and HCR complementarity frameworks to investigate
   the individual and collective impact of analytical and storytelling
   skills on People Analysts perceived job performance. A mixed-method
   sequential explanatory research design is adopted, finding mixed
   results. Consistent with existing research, results from Phase 1 find
   People Analysts perceive storytelling skills to be positively associated
   with their job performance. However, contrary to existing claims, the
   findings reveal that analytical skills are only perceived to be
   significant in influencing People Analysts job performance when combined
   with storytelling skills, supporting a complementarity HCR relationship.
   To further explain the findings from Phase 1, Phase 2 involved
   collecting data from 50 people analytics professionals via
   semi-structured interviews. Results from the thematic analysis reinforce
   the survey findings while also illustrating that People Analysts
   perceive the complementarity relationship between analytical and
   storytelling skills as important for improving job performance.
   Accordingly, we argue that debate in this area should be reframed to
   acknowledge the necessity of complementarities in building people
   analytics capabilities.},

Abstract = {Using a unique setting where stand-alone banks submit filings to bank
   regulators instead of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC),
   we examine the consequences of fragmented securities regulation for
   information-processing costs and opportunistic insider trading. We find
   the market reaction to insider-trading filings on FDICconnect less
   timely than to those on SEC's Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and
   Retrieval (EDGAR) system, suggesting FDICconnect generates higher
   information-processing costs. We also find only large investors trade
   more on insider-trading filings on FDICconnect than on insider-trading
   filings on SEC EDGAR, thus extracting benefits from the delayed market
   reaction to insider-trading filings on FDICconnect. Finally, we find
   increased insider selling in stand-alone banks prior to negative
   earnings news, suggesting insiders' opportunistic use of private
   information. These findings collectively suggest regulatory
   fragmentation undermines market efficiency and distorts the level
   playing field.},

Abstract = {Prior work on leadership in information systems development (ISD) teams
   has assumed that all developers are treated equally by their team leader
   and ignored the possibility that differentiated leader-member exchange
   (LMX) may be an important instrument for team leaders to influence
   self-organizing, agile ISD teams. We conducted a concurrent mixed
   methods inquiry to understand how LMX differentiation is associated with
   developer satisfaction in agile ISD teams and through which team
   processes agile ISD teams address LMX differentiation. We ran a
   multilevel, multistage survey of 1,894 software developers in 217 teams
   and an embedded case study of five ISD teams drawing on qualitative data
   from 40 interviews of developers and team leaders. Two focus groups (one
   with 10 developers and one with 10 team leaders) helped to substantiate
   the meta-inferences from the quantitative and qualitative studies. The
   results showed that LMX differentiation was positively associated with
   developer satisfaction, especially in teams with high-quality
   team-member exchange (TMX). We identify three team processes (i.e.,
   collectivization of resources, visible appreciation of privileges, and
   freeing up leader capacities) that are enacted through agile ISD
   practices and allow ISD teams to leverage benefits from LMX
   differentiation for all their members.},

Abstract = {Topic models are becoming a frequently employed tool in the empirical
   methods repertoire of information systems and management scholars. Given
   textual corpora, such as consumer reviews and online discussion forums,
   researchers and business practitioners often use topic modeling to
   either explore data in an unsupervised fashion or generate variables of
   interest for subsequent econometric analysis. However, one important
   concern stems from the fact that topic models can be notorious for their
   instability, i.e., the generated results could be inconsistent and
   irreproducible at different times, even on the same dataset. Therefore,
   researchers might arrive at potentially unreliable results regarding the
   theoretical relationships that they are testing or developing. In this
   paper, we attempt to highlight this problem and suggest a potential
   approach to addressing it. First, we empirically define and evaluate the
   stability problem of topic models using four textual datasets. Next, to
   alleviate the problem and with the goal of extracting actionable
   insights from textual data, we propose a new method, Stable LDA, which
   incorporates topical word clusters into the topic model to steer the
   model inference toward consistent results. We show that the proposed
   Stable LDA approach can significantly improve model stability while
   maintaining or even improving the topic model quality. Further,
   employing two case studies related to an online knowledge community and
   online consumer reviews, we demonstrate that the variables generated
   from Stable LDA can lead to more consistent estimations in econometric
   analyses. We believe that our work can further enhance management
   scholars' collective toolkit to analyze ever-growing textual data.},

Title = {Externalities of Financial Statement Fraud on the Incoming Accounting
   Labor Force},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ACCOUNTING RESEARCH},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {61},
Number = {5},
Pages = {1531-1589},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Financial statement fraud generates many negative effects, including
   reducing people's willingness to participate in the stock market. If it
   also stigmatizes accounting, it may similarly adversely affect the
   quantity and quality of workers willing to become accountants, thereby
   potentially creating negative effects for years to come. We examine the
   impact of fraud on the labor force entering the accounting profession,
   which is a key input into the production of accounting information
   (i.e., the output). Using data describing millions of college students
   across the United States, we find incoming students are actually more
   likely to major in accounting when local frauds occur during their
   formative years. These students are also more likely to have attributes
   desired by the accounting profession (e.g., high academic aptitude) and
   are more likely to subsequently serve in public accounting and become
   Certified Public Accountants. In the context of other fields (i.e., all
   college majors), we find that fraud similarly spurs interest in other
   business disciplines, but not in majors outside of business schools.
   Those attracted to other business disciplines, however, generally
   possess different traits. Specifically, students entering accounting are
   distinctively more likely to exhibit values espoused by the accounting
   profession, including a predisposition to public service and less
   commercial orientation. Thus, nonpecuniary motives appear to uniquely
   drive accounting student enrollment following fraud. Collectively, our
   findings suggest that, while fraud is unmistakably bad, it appears to
   have the positive unintended consequence of attracting labor into
   business disciplines and, in accounting, increasing the prevalence of
   desirable traits among entrants.},

Abstract = {The stated goal of the SEC Whistleblower Program introduced as part of
   the Dodd-Frank Act was to deter securities violations and thereby to
   strengthen investor protection. We document significant reductions in
   the likelihood of financial reporting fraud by US firms following the
   introduction of this program. The reductions are robust to controlling
   for other regulatory changes in the Dodd-Frank Act and economic trends.
   Given that employees of firms with weaker internal compliance and
   reporting programs are more likely to report irregularities directly to
   the SEC rather than internally, we predict and find that these firms are
   more likely to change their reporting behavior. We also show that the
   observed reductions are attributable to an improvement in internal
   whistleblower programs and the hiring of more capable audit committee
   members after the program's inception. Collectively, these findings
   provide important large-sample evidence of significant benefits of the
   SEC Whistleblower Program for deterring financial reporting fraud and of
   the efficacy of bounty-type whistleblower programs.},

Abstract = {How do firms address complex collective action problems effectively?
   Institutional and stakeholder research suggests that firms may avoid the
   tragedy of the commons by aligning the interests of critical proximate
   stakeholders in ways that governments cannot accomplish. This
   phenomenological paper investigates this possibility by analyzing Amazon
   rainforest preservation by Natura, a Brazilian cosmetics company. The
   results indicate that Natura internalized environmental externalities by
   linking ecologically conscious consumers with rural Amazonian
   communities. A differences-in-differences analysis compares forest
   preservation and fire activity in the municipalities that Natura entered
   with those in which it did not enter. Natura's impact is identified
   through an instrumental variable analysis using missing satellite
   images, which Natura relied upon to decide which municipalities to
   enter. Quantitative results tie Natura's entry into municipalities with
   forest preservation. Analysis of three mechanisms associates Natura's
   involvement with stakeholder decisions to cultivate diverse
   forest-generated crops instead of clearing the land for conventional
   agriculture. This study contributes to the management literature by
   suggesting how firms can address important global challenges, such as
   rainforest preservation, by investing in stakeholder capability
   development and by creating institutional arrangements in line with
   those envisioned elsewhere.},

Abstract = {Executives have incentives to predict the price impact of disclosures to
   inform their insider trades, reporting discretion, and operating
   decision-making. Yet the extent to which they can do so accurately is

   executives' accuracy, recruiting over 650 U.S. public company executives
   to share their predictions of the stock price response to their
   companies' second quarter 2020 quarterly reports. Despite the market
   volatility and uncertainty at the onset of COVID-19, executives'
   predictions of the one-day price reaction are directionally correct in
   two-thirds of cases. Further, executives' short-window expectation
   errors predict returns. Following their companies' reports, executives
   trade against the market in line with their initial error, and stock
   prices largely converge to their expectations over the subsequent 100
   trading days. Collectively, our results provide novel evidence of
   executives' superior ability to anticipate how the market prices

Title = {Self-Disclosure and Respect: Understanding the Engagement of Value
   Minorities},
Journal = {ORGANIZATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {35},
Number = {3},
Month = {MAY-JUN},
Abstract = {Organizations benefit from including employees with dissimilar values
   and perspectives, but their ability to realize these benefits is
   constrained by the degree to which those holding the dissimilar values
   (i.e., value minorities) feel comfortable engaging with their colleagues
   and the work of the collective. We extend theory on value dissimilarity
   by directly examining the experience of individuals whose values are
   dissimilar from those of their colleagues, and factors driving their
   engagement in work. Our examination spanned three studies: a laboratory
   experiment, a vignette study of employed adults, and a three wave survey
   of student project groups. We found that the negative relationship
   between holding dissimilar values from one's colleagues and engagement
   was lessened when value minorities disclosed personal information
   unrelated to their dissimilar values (Studies 1-3). Self-disclosure also
   moderated the negative relationship between value dissimilarity and
   feeling respected by one's colleagues (Studies 2 and 3). Furthermore,
   felt respect mediated the effect of value dissimilarity on engagement,
   and this indirect effect was moderated by self-disclosure (Studies 2 and
   3). Overall, this research is relevant to organizations seeking to
   capitalize upon the benefits of minority perspectives in the workforce
   but suggests that a critical first step is to prioritize the experience
   of value minorities and the decreased sense of social worth that can
   accompany this experience. By fostering an environment conducive to
   self-disclosure, organizations can help to alleviate the discomfort
   associated with value dissimilarity, thereby ensuring that all people,
   including the value minority, feel respected and are maximally engaged
   at work.},

Title = {Coordination in a Digital Platform Organization},
Journal = {INFORMATION SYSTEMS RESEARCH},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {35},
Number = {1},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {A digital platform (DP) generates value by facilitating direct
   interactions between two or multiple platform sides. While previous
   studies have expounded upon how platform sides can be coordinated at a
   collective level (i.e., by pricing strategy and modular architecture),
   digital platform owners must not neglect the dynamics within the
   platform sides and their interactions. Through an in-depth case study of
   one of the largest e-commerce platforms worldwide, we develop a process
   model that explains digital platform coordination in terms of the
   mechanisms that describe the emergence of coordination issues as a
   result of the enactment of the platform sides' agency and how these
   issues can be circumvented. This study makes two contributions. First,
   this study challenges the existing DP literature concerning the
   assumption of exogenous platform sides, highlighting the agency of the
   sides as a source of misalignment that must be managed. Second, the
   model complements the platform coordination literature focusing on
   enabling/constraining the actions of sides by conceptualizing a digital
   orienting mechanism. By adopting a meta-organizational view of digital
   platforms, this empirical work is among the few studies that report from
   the inside of a digital platform organization and adopt a processual
   account.},

Abstract = {Societal actors increasingly expect multinational enterprises (MNEs) to
   positively impact the host countries in which they operate. While these
   expectations have prompted IB scholars to engage more extensively with
   the societal impacts of foreign direct investment (FDI), our collective
   knowledge of these impacts is limited. Early IB literature investigated
   FDI's aggregate impact but generally confined the scope to economic
   effects. Contemporary, strategy-oriented IB scholarship broadened the
   scope of impact types to include social and ecological effects, yet
   mostly limited the scope of the impacted actors to MNEs themselves. We
   argue that IB research should more comprehensively assess FDI's impact
   by incorporating social and ecological effects in addition to economic
   ones, and by accounting for a broader set of stakeholders beyond MNEs.
   IB scholars should challenge the assumption that FDI's economic impacts
   spill over to positive societal outcomes, and that MNEs' interests
   parallel those of host countries. A more comprehensive assessment will
   require IB scholars to question ``win-win{''} assumptions about the
   complementarity of corporate societal and financial performance, examine
   FDI's societal impact over longer time horizons, leverage innovative
   approaches from allied sciences, and consider interactions between
   different types of societal effects in order to appreciate their
   sometimes countervailing effects.},

Title = {From a Spark to a Sweeping Fire: An Integrative Conceptual Review of
   Group Turnover and a Theoretical Exploration of Its Development},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF APPLIED PSYCHOLOGY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {109},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The phenomenon of group turnover has generated substantial yet
   disconnected scholarly interests. Despite valuable insights gained from
   the collective turnover literature as well as parallel research
   concerning related or coordinated quitting, a holistic understanding of
   the unique group turnover phenomenon is needed, both to synthesize
   existing research across multiple domains and disciplines and to kindle
   new inquiries regarding its dynamic nature and developmental process. To
   this end, we begin by conducting an integrative review of research
   relating to group turnover, reinterpreting it by identifying its common
   pathways as a function of varying triggers, temporal patterns, and
   departure destinations. We then leverage the groups literature to
   explicate group turnover's self-reinforcing and dynamic nature and
   propose a three-dimensional Interdependence, Temporality, and Emergence
   (ITE) framework that accounts for its developmental process. Using this
   framework, we develop an illustrative set of propositions regarding how
   ITE-related group properties affect the extent to which individual
   departures might escalate into group turnover of a larger scale and
   faster speed. Our emphasis on groups as a unique unit of reference thus
   provides an important conceptual refinement and extension for
   understanding collective turnover-shifting from a static focus on
   aggregate exit (rates) to a dynamic focus on the often-coordinated,
   temporally evolving nature of multiple group member quit events.},

Title = {Unpacking On-Task Effort in Performance-Based Learning:
   Information-Knowledge Gaps Guide Effort Allocation Decisions},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF APPLIED PSYCHOLOGY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {109},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Learning and adaptation are essential for success. However, human effort
   is inherently finite, which creates a dilemma for employees. Is it
   better to prioritize capitalizing on existing knowledge structures to
   maximize immediate performance benefits (exploitation) or develop
   adaptive capabilities (exploration) at the expense of short-term
   productivity? Understanding how employees answer this question can
   inform the design of evidence-based interventions for optimizing and
   sustaining learning amidst workplace challenges. In this article, we
   attempt to unpack the composition of on-task effort during
   performance-based learning by testing the proposition that the
   information-knowledge gap-a regulatory discrepancy between unknown
   aspects of a task and a person's perceived competence in dealing with
   that task-is the psychological mechanism responsible for guiding
   effort-allocation decisions during performance-based learning. In Study
   1, we found that larger information-knowledge gaps resulted in increased
   subsequent investments of on-task attention within a sample of adults
   learning to perform a complex task (N = 121). As participants learned,
   information-knowledge gaps systematically shrank, resulting in a reduced
   emphasis on learning-oriented effort (i.e., exploration) relative to
   achievement-oriented effort (i.e., exploitation) over time. In Study 2
   (N = 176), a task-change paradigm revealed that introducing novel
   demands caused information-knowledge gaps to suddenly expand, which
   prompted participants to increase on-task effort and shift their focus
   away from achievement and back toward learning as an adaptive response.
   Collectively, these findings support the notion that
   information-knowledge gaps shape how (and when) on-task effort is spent
   and present a framework for understanding how learners strategically
   structure their limited attentional resources.},

Title = {Moving On: Exploring the Implications of Leader Departure and Incoming
   Temporary Leaders for Collective Turnover and Unit Performance},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF APPLIED PSYCHOLOGY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {109},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {While leader departures from work units frequently occur within
   organizations and are assumed to negatively impact unit functioning, the
   collective reaction to a leader departure event can vary across time.
   While a common expectation of leader departure models is that the
   incoming leader is permanent, it is unclear how unit-level reactions,
   such as collective turnover and unit performance, might change over time
   in response to a departure event when the departing leader is replaced
   with a temporary leader. We draw on context emergent turnover (CET)
   theory and literature on leader departures to develop and empirically
   test specific hypotheses exploring relationships among leader
   departures, collective turnover, and unit performance over time. In
   addition, we examine the extent to which these relationships are
   influenced by the temporary status of the incoming leader. Using
   discontinuous growth models, we examine a longitudinal data set from 324
   units within a large Latin American operation of a global direct sales
   company (N = 3,082 performance periods). Findings indicate that, after a
   leader departs, there is an immediate increase in collective turnover
   and that unit performance decreases over time. Further, when the
   incoming leader is temporary, unit performance increases briefly, but
   the rate of performance drops over time. Overall, our research offers
   insights with regard to how leader departures impact unit outcomes, as
   well as how long such effects last.},

   SINGLE-GENDER COALITIONS IN ADVOCATING FOR GENDER EQUITY},
Journal = {ACADEMY OF MANAGEMENT JOURNAL},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {66},
Number = {4},
Pages = {1233-1262},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Employees often engage in collective grassroots efforts to bring about
   gender equity in the workplace. Such coalition-based advocacy is largely
   driven by women, which has led to debate about whether men's involvement
   as allies can help. Integrating literatures on signaling and legitimacy,
   we propose that the demographic composition of a gender equity advocacy
   coalition matters: men-only groups lack ``coalition legitimacy,{''} or
   the perception that they are the ``right{''} spokespersons for gender
   equity issues, whereas women-only groups struggle to convey ``issue
   legitimacy,{''} or the perception that gender equity is of strategic
   importance within business organizations. By contrast, mixed -gender
   coalitions signal both forms of legitimacy, and are thus uniquely
   effective. We demonstrate these effects over three studies: managers
   reporting on advocacy coalitions comprising their colleagues (Study 1),
   an audio-based study showing that the proposed effects are unique for
   gender equity issues (Study 2), and a stimulus sampling study involving
   multiple policy proposals (Study 3). Our findings highlight the
   different forms of legitimacy that women and men bring to the table when
   selling gender equity issues. We discuss implications for who should be
   recruited to gender equity advocacy coalitions, and why.},

Title = {For Shame! Socially Unacceptable Brand Mentions on Social Media Motivate
   Consumer Disengagement},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MARKETING},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {88},
Number = {2},
Pages = {61-78},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Brands invest tremendous resources into building engagement with their
   customers on social media. But considerably less focus is placed on
   addressing disengagement, when users actively choose to distance
   themselves from the brand through reduced posting or even unfollowing.
   The authors find that the same self-brand connections that lead
   individuals to defensively protect the brand can also lead them to
   experience shame vicariously when others mention the brand in socially
   unacceptable ways. Experiencing vicarious shame motivates them to
   distance themselves from the brand, driving disengagement. Three
   mixed-method studies show that a socially unacceptable behavior-using
   profanity while mentioning the brand-leads highly connected consumers to
   experience vicarious shame, prompting disengagement motivations and
   ultimately leading to real-world unfollowing behaviors on social media.
   The authors also show that proactive moderation behaviors by the brand
   can attenuate these responses. These results provide insight into the
   process by which self-brand connection interacts with socially
   unacceptable brand mentions and suggest a limitation to the insulating
   effects of strong self-brand connections.},

Abstract = {Green development is the main theme of today's economic and social
   development. Given the principle of ``a promising government and an
   effective market{''}, how to promote the green development of
   state-owned enterprises (SOEs) through government regulations is a
   scientific problem to be solved urgently. Leveraging the quasinatural
   experiment of the Opinions on Further Promoting the Implementation of
   the ``Three Importances and One Greatness{''} Decision-making System in
   SOEs by the General Office of the CPC Central Committee and the General
   Office of the State Council in 2010 in China, we examine the impact of
   the ``Three Importances and One Greatness{''} system on SOEs' green
   innovation and its mechanism. The results show that the enforcement of
   this system significantly improves the green innovation level of SOEs.
   Specifically, the green innovation level of SOEs increased by 23.98\% on
   average after the implementation of the system, which is equivalent to
   an average increase of 1.271 in green patents granted. Moreover, the
   mechanism test results show that the effect of ``Three Importances and
   One Greatness{''} on the green innovation level of SOEs occurs by
   inhibiting management myopia and increasing enterprises' green
   investments. Furthermore, the impact of the collective decision-making
   system on the level of green innovation is more pronounced among firms
   separated by their large scale and high media attention.},

Title = {Explaining technical change and its impacts over the very long term: The
   case of the Atlantic sardine fishery in France from 1900 to 2017},
Journal = {RESEARCH POLICY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {52},
Number = {9},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {As an industry based upon the harvesting of wild resources, the fishery
   is often used in economics to showcase the effects of its specific
   nature on human behavior and the impacts of that behavior on the fish
   stock itself. The common-pool status usually encountered in the use of
   these resources makes them especially vulnerable to major shifts in the
   supporting ecosystems, but also to rapid technical change. In most other
   parts of the economy, technical change and the creative destruction that
   it brings along are viewed positively, and even given central role in
   recent theories of growth. Happily for the creatures of the ocean that
   are hunted, fishers do not fit the mould of Schumpetarian entrepreneurs
   bent on creative destruction. However, the technology that does drift
   onto boats has had concerning effects on the status of fish stocks with
   important economic and cultural consequences. We present a narrative of
   the French sardine fishery using the evolutionary theory of technical
   change. The wild binary segmentation approach was applied on a
   time-series of French sardine landings from 1900 to 2017. This analysis
   revealed three significant production change points associated with
   important technical changes in the fishery. The first change point, in
   1927, is related to the introduction of the purse-seine in France. The
   introduction of the mid-water trawl is the second change point in the
   early 1970s. A third change point occurred in 1998, where we see a
   reswitch from mid-water trawl to purse-seine. Collectively, these
   results highlight the technological changes in sardine production that
   occurred, but more importantly, the impacts of these changes both on the
   structure of the population of sardines, and on the industry. The lesson
   we derive from this case study is that technical change should be
   considered as a succession of shifts rather than a unidirectional
   history.},

Title = {When Focus and Vision Become a Nightmare: Bottom-Line Mentality Climate,

Journal = {JOURNAL OF APPLIED PSYCHOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {108},
Number = {12},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Drawing on goal shielding theory (Shah et al., 2002), our study
   highlights the roles of bottom-line mentality climates and shared vision
   in encouraging collective unethical conduct in pursuit of financial
   results. Consistent with the theory, we hypothesize that high
   bottom-line mentality leaders shape their unit's bottom-line mentality
   climate by explicitly clarifying the importance of prioritizing
   financial results above all else and using motivational resources to
   encourage a sole focus on bottom-line attainment. We further hypothesize
   that a unit's shared vision, which captures a collective sense of
   purpose and direction, is a critical aspect of the unit's motivational
   context that increases the likelihood for collective bottom-line
   enhancing, unethical behaviors (i.e., concealing errors, bribery, and
   unethical pro-organizational behavior) in units with a salient
   bottom-line mentality climate. We test our hypotheses in a two-wave,
   multi-industry field study of work units in central Italy (N = 96).
   Results indicate that leaders with a bottom-line mentality foster a
   bottom-line mentality climate in the units they lead, and the linkages
   with unit unethical conduct are dependent on the unit's shared vision.
   While shared vision strengthened the effects of bottom-line mentality
   climates on concealing errors, it served as a necessary condition to
   motivate more severe forms of unethical conduct. Our study thus
   demonstrates a dark side to shared vision in that it channels
   motivational resources toward a unit's bottom-line priorities. When
   those priorities are singularly focused on the bottom line, shared
   vision can help to motivate undesirable behavior.},

Title = {The importance of individual-pair lending relationships},
Journal = {REVIEW OF ACCOUNTING STUDIES},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {29},
Number = {4},
Pages = {3907-3945},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {We examine the significance and uniqueness of individual-pair
   relationships cultivated through repeated loan interactions. Using a
   hand-collected dataset compiled of borrowing manager and loan officer
   information, we find that individual-pair relationship loans are
   associated with a cost-of-debt reduction of between seven to 13 basis
   points. We also document that the relationship has an economic impact
   even when other affiliations, for example, institutional pairs, social
   ties, cultural proximity, and gender, are considered. Individual-pair
   relationships matter because they furnish lenders with useful soft
   information, especially when the firm has a poor hard information
   environment or when the bank and loan officer rely less on hard
   information. In addition, we find that individual-pair relationship
   loans have fewer rating downgrades, suggesting that accumulated soft
   information leads to better loan quality. Collectively, our results
   highlight the unique value of sustained professional engagement between
   two individuals in the lending process.},

Abstract = {Corruption is often seen as one of the root causes of pressing national
   and global challenges. The persisting stark national differences in
   corruption levels and their potential causes have thus attracted growing
   interest from international business scholars. The objective of this
   study was to re-examine key factors that predict levels of national
   corruption. Drawing on comprehensive personality data from over 5
   million respondents across 87 nations, and numerous dimensions of
   national culture, the study examines the relative importance of national
   personality versus national culture and wealth as predictors of national
   corruption. Regression analysis found that collectivism (particularly
   societal practices pertaining to collectivism) and wealth were robust
   predictors of corruption. In contrast, there was no consistent support
   for the effects of the Big Five personality traits aggregated to the
   national level, above and beyond the effects of national culture and
   wealth. These findings highlight and specify the important role played
   by national culture, and call into question previous research on
   national personality and corruption. More broadly, our study further
   highlights the need to exert caution when examining the influence of
   national-level personality, and the need for cross-national personality
   researchers to improve the validity, interpretability, and replicability
   of their work.},

Title = {Customer base environmental disclosure and supplier greenhouse gas
   emissions: A signaling theory perspective},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {70},
Number = {3, SI},
Pages = {355-380},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {As suppliers' emissions contribute to a significant portion of the
   global environmental footprint, achieving supply chain wide carbon
   neutrality largely depends on suppliers' greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions
   reductions. Although suppliers' customers are increasingly signaling
   their commitment to tackling climate change through environmental
   disclosure, whether this signal contributes to supplier emissions
   reduction remains a question. Using signaling theory, this research
   proposes an emissions-reducing effect of customer base environmental
   disclosure on a supplier's GHG emissions level. Using a 2010-2017 panel
   dataset from multiple sources, we find empirical evidence supporting the
   upstream emissions-reducing effect of customer base environmental
   disclosure. Further, we identify two customer-base characteristics that
   affect this relationship: customer base climate innovation and
   competition. These findings contribute to the sustainable supply chain
   management literature by illustrating the effects of the customer base
   on supplier emissions performance. Specifically, customers could
   motivate a supplier's engagement in emissions reduction by collectively
   signaling their environmental commitment through enhanced disclosure.
   However, the effectiveness of this signaling effect can be contingent on
   the green innovation and competitive dynamics of the customer base.},

Abstract = {This article explores how heterogeneous and distributed forms of
   social-symbolic work combine over time to yield synergistic
   relationships that precipitate institutional change. We study a
   collective effort by patient activists to change the technological and
   regulatory standards of Type 1 diabetes care. We offer contributions to
   radical flank theory by conceptualizing radical and moderate flanks as
   dynamic and overlapping pathways of action rather than fixed actor
   positions, and we show how a medial `bonding' pathway can provide
   important social glue to connect the radical and moderate flanks. While
   in our case the material and discursive `hacking' work in the breaching
   pathway disrupted institutions, triggered technology innovation, and

Title = {Internal Mobility: A Review and Agenda for Future Research},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {50},
Number = {1},
Pages = {264-306},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Internal mobility, or movement of individuals within organizations, is a
   frequently occurring phenomenon that can have ripple effects throughout
   organizations. Internal mobility can impact individuals, units, and
   organizations and several decades of work on the topic provide evidence
   of its causes and consequences. While a recent uptick in research on
   internal mobility aligns with upward trends in the use of internal labor
   markets within organizations, the literature is currently not well
   integrated with a variety of terms and characteristics used to describe
   internal mobility, siloed single-level research on either individual or
   organization perspectives, and poor integration with other forms of
   mobility that makes it difficult to fully understand its impact. This
   review of the 202 articles on internal mobility reconciles these issues
   by defining internal mobility, creating a model based around the two
   primary types of internal mobility, transfers and promotions, and
   integrating research from varied organizational actors (individuals,
   organizations) that cause and are affected by internal mobility. This
   review culminates with a future research agenda designed to extend
   research on internal mobility.},

Title = {Leveraging Learning Collectives: How Novice Outsiders Break into an
   Occupation},
Journal = {ORGANIZATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {35},
Number = {3},
Month = {MAY-JUN},
Abstract = {Existing research depicts occupational learning as predominantly
   happening through formal education, situated learning, or a combination
   of the two. How career switchers might develop occupational skills
   outside of these established learning pathways is understudied. This
   paper examines how novice outsiders break into a skilled occupation by
   looking at the case of aspiring software developers attending coding
   bootcamps. Drawing on 17 months of fieldwork in the San Francisco Bay
   area, I find that bootcamps did not resemble either schools or
   workplaces, the two institutions that facilitate occupational learning.
   Instead, bootcamps scaffolded learning collectives-groups composed of
   peers and near peers who learn collaboratively and purposefully to reach
   a shared goal. Within learning collectives, aspirants progressed from
   novice outsiders to hirable software developers, despite limited access
   to proximate experts to learn from or legitimate peripheral
   participation opportunities. Three scaffoldings facilitated learning at
   bootcamps. First, peer team structures turned what is normally a
   solitary activity-writing code-into a collaborative endeavor and
   facilitated peer-to-peer knowledge exchange. Second, near-peer role
   structures engaged recent graduates in teaching and mentorship
   relationships with novices so that aspirants could access knowledge
   quickly and easily. Third, bootcamps encouraged aspirants to self-learn
   by reaching out to the expertise of the broader occupational community.
   This third scaffolding prepared aspirants for learning beyond the
   bootcamp curriculum and socialized them for an occupation with high
   learning demands. The outcome of this process was that novices pursuing
   an alternative mode of occupational entry developed both occupational
   skills and new self-conceptions as software developers.},

Abstract = {Collective intellectual property of traditional knowledge by Indigenous
   peoples and local communities is an important source of innovation and
   product development. In this article, we investigate collective
   intellectual property systems on the traditional knowledge of Aspalathus
   linearis, also known as rooibos-an endemic plant from South Africa which
   is the basis of an important herbal tea industry. We analyze how issues
   of misappro-priation on rooibos have been addressed through the
   establishment of two industry-wide collective intellectual property
   systems: a geographical indication and a benefit-sharing agreement. In a
   context characterized by high socio-economic inequalities, these systems
   are built on institutions for collective action that display important
   power asymmetries between social groups. We contribute to ongoing
   debates about intellectual property impacts by investigating how
   collective intellectual property systems enable the sharing of benefits
   arising from the use of biodiversity and related knowledge, but can be
   sources of exclusion that reflect asymmetric power dynamics.},

Title = {Escaping the Scapegoat Trap: Using Rene Girard's Framework for Workplace
   Bullying},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ETHICS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {191},
Number = {2},
Pages = {269-283},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {This study aims at developing a theoretical model for workplace bullying
   using Rene Girard's scapegoating framework. Despite the wide range of
   labels and related constructs present in workplace bullying literature,
   the explanation of the phenomenon is often studied under theoretical
   frameworks that do not always capture the nature of the concept. Indeed,
   the need to find instruments and tools to reduce or solve workplace
   bullying overshadowed conceptual and theoretical matters, leaving the
   concept undertheorized. By broadening the spectrum of social sciences
   beyond managerial and organizational studies, we propose to use Rene
   Girard's scapegoating framework to shed new light on workplace bullying.
   The scapegoating framework allows us to understand better some
   collective and social dimensions of workplace bullying, catching
   relevant elements that characterize this phenomenon, also those that are
   less evident from organizational studies. In a Girardian sense,
   scapegoating is like a trap that every human society falls into, and
   many aspects of workplace bullying recall its mechanism. For Girard, a
   human group or society can fall into a spiral of reciprocal violence
   because of the mimetic desire mechanism, risking a conflict escalation:
   violence begets more violence, putting at risk the stability or even the
   existence of this group or society. Scapegoating is a way to overcome
   reciprocal violence by uniting against a single victim who cannot
   reciprocate this violence. This study also proposes a tentative way to
   escape this trap: positive mimesis and gift-giving.},

Abstract = {We study policy experimentation in organizations with endogenous

   based on its results. As information arrives, agents update their
   beliefs, and enter or leave the organization based on their expected
   flow payoffs. Unsuccessful experiments make all agents more pessimistic,
   but also drive out conservative members. We identify sufficient
   conditions under which the latter effect dominates, leading to excessive
   experimentation. In fact, the organization may experiment forever in the
   face of mounting negative evidence. Ex post heterogeneous payoffs
   exacerbate the problem, as optimists can join forces with guaranteed
   winners. Control by shareholders who own all future payoffs, however,
   can have a corrective effect. Our results contrast with models of
   collective experimentation with fixed membership, in which
   under-experimentation is the typical outcome.},

   Specifically, we illustrate how a corporation's political activities
   allow it to gain the power to suppress its mnemonic community's voices,
   thereby attenuating an irresponsible event's memory from the minds of
   its stakeholders, protecting its image, and maintaining legitimacy in
   the shareholder and state's eyes. We also highlight how the remembrance
   and forgetting of an irresponsible incident diverges between
   stakeholders based on their characteristics, future goals, and
   aspirations and whether they directly suffered from the disaster. Our

Abstract = {By conceptualizing similarity among firms in terms of overlapping
   resources, research on location choice has found that similar firms tend
   to locate far from one another. Yet, a resource-overlap perspective may
   not always align with decision-makers' similarity classifications. In
   this article, we propose that new entrants also perceive firm
   similarities in terms of collective identities, and we examine how
   competition between collective identities influences entrants' choice of
   location. Our arguments center on the distinction between unaffiliated
   traditionalists, actors who are loyal to values and practices originally
   associated with a label and who emphasize autonomy, and affiliated
   modernists, actors who reinterpret a label using different values and
   practices and who seek consistency. Analyzing the entry of 177 artisan
   bakers within the city of Lyon from 1998 to 2017, we find that new
   entrants locate where prior actors with similar collective identities
   had located previously. To differentiate through competition, however,
   some new entrants also tend to prefer locations closer to actors who are
   encroaching on their collective identity, most evident among
   traditionalists choosing to locate near modernists. By integrating a
   collective-identity perspective with location choice, we show how the
   sociocognitive basis of similarity classification shapes new entrants'
   competitive behavior.},

Abstract = {Organizational scholars have treated emotions mostly as an
   individual-level phenomenon, with limited theorisation of emotions as an
   important component in social embeddedness. In this review essay, we
   argue for the need for a toolkit to study emotions as an inherently
   social phenomenon. To do so, we apply insights from sociology that have
   been under-utilized in management and organization research. We focus on
   three sociological concepts: collective emotions and social bonds,
   emotional energy and moral batteries, and emotional capital. We then
   develop an integrative model of emotional embeddedness to emphasize that
   emotions are socially constructed and socially authorized. We end the
   paper by setting out a research agenda for more research in management
   and organization that is informed by these three concepts.},

Title = {How Culture Shapes the Influence of Work Design Characteristics: A
   Narrative and Meta-Analytic Review},

Abstract = {This paper presents a comprehensive review and meta-analysis of the
   literature on the influence of cultural dimensions on work design
   characteristics. With our proposed work design universals typology as a
   framework, we provide a narrative review and analyze the influence of
   six cultural dimensions (power distance, individualism-collectivism,
   masculinity-femininity, uncertainty avoidance, long-term orientation,
   and indulgence-restraint) on work design characteristics' effects on job
   satisfaction and performance. In addition to running meta-analytic
   regressions examining the role of cultural characteristics as individual
   moderators of the relationship between work design characteristics' and
   job satisfaction and performance, we further utilize qualitative
   comparative analysis to move beyond treating each cultural dimension as
   an independent predictor and, instead, investigate configurations of
   cultural dimensions as moderating variables of the relationships between
   work design characteristics and workplace outcomes. The present effort,
   therefore, serves as a test of a complex universal approach when
   examining the influence of culture on the relationship between work
   design characteristics and outcomes. Collectively, this study provides a
   systematic narrative and quantitative review of the work design
   literature to assess how cultural dimensions (both individually and
   through complex configurations) may affect the impact of work design
   characteristics on job satisfaction and performance. Based on our
   review, we offer recommendations for future research and continued calls
   for more systematic and integrative cross-cultural work design research.},

Title = {The limits of psychological safety: Nonlinear relationships with
   performance},
Journal = {ORGANIZATIONAL BEHAVIOR AND HUMAN DECISION PROCESSES},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {177},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {While psychological safety climate is widely seen as having a positive
   relationship with work performance, there are compelling reasons as to
   why that may not always apply. We draw on cognitive psychology
   literature to suggest that high levels of psychological safety climate
   can actually harm the performance of routine tasks. The negative effect
   of high levels of psychological safety climate on these tasks can be
   moderated, however, by collective accountability. We find evidence for
   these propositions across five independent studies at different levels
   of analysis and organizational settings. We find that while moderate
   levels of psychological safety climate are associated with better
   in-role performance, high levels are associated with decreasing in-role
   performance. Collective accountability can buffer that decreasing
   performance. These results help identify the boundary conditions of
   psychological safety climate and extend research on it to
   organization-level and business outcomes with real-world consequences.},

Abstract = {Participants in open collaboration communities coproduce knowledge
   despite minimal explicit communication to coordinate the efforts.
   Studying how participants coordinate around the knowledge artifact and
   its impacts are critical for understanding the open knowledge production
   model. This study builds on the theory of stigmergy, wherein actions
   performed by a participant leave traces on a knowledge artifact and
   stimulate succeeding actions. We find that stigmergy involves two
   intertwined processes: collective modification and collective
   excitation. We propose a new measure of stigmergy based on the spatial
   and temporal clustering of contributions. By analyzing thousands of
   Wikipedia articles, we find that the degree of stigmergy is positively
   associated with community members' participation and the quality of the
   knowledge produced. This study contributes to the understanding of open
   collaboration by characterizing the spatial-temporal clustering of
   contributions and providing new insights into the relationship between
   stigmergy and knowledge production outcomes. These findings can help
   practitioners increase user engagement in knowledge production processes
   in order to create more sustainable open collaboration communities.},

Title = {Preventing Success: How a Prevention Focus Causes Leaders to Overrule

Journal = {JOURNAL OF APPLIED PSYCHOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {108},
Number = {7},
Pages = {1121-1136},

Abstract = {We examine the effects of leader prevention focus on the leader's own
   behavior, in the form of the harmful overruling of good ideas by their
   follower team, and on the team's collective behaviors, processes, and
   performance. We argue that when leaders adopt a prevention mindset, it
   can have costly effects on team outcomes. We tested our hypotheses using
   an experimental design in which 84 five-person teams engaged in a
   networked simulation, and we manipulated leader prevention focus through
   selection and training. Our hypotheses were generally supported.
   Specifically, we found that leaders with a prevention focus are more
   likely to engage in the faulty overruling of their team's decisions,
   causing the team to miss opportunities. We also found that teams with
   prevention-focused leaders tend to achieve lower levels of performance
   gains and we test the role of three mediating processes and states that
   convey the effects of leader prevention focus on reduced performance
   gains: increased risk avoidance, reduced team prospecting, and lower
   positive team affective tone. We show support for the mediating role of
   both reduced team prospecting and lower positive team affective tone.
   Finally, we show that team member reward responsiveness moderates the
   effects of leader prevention focus on team risk avoidance and
   prospecting. We discuss the theoretical and managerial implications of
   our findings.},

Title = {A Real Utopia Under What Conditions? The Economic and Social Benefits of

Journal = {ORGANIZATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {34},
Number = {4},
Pages = {1353-1382},
Month = {JUL-AUG},
Abstract = {Given consistent evidence of its social benefits but questions about its
   market viability, this paper examines the conditions under which
   workplace democracy can be understood as a ``real utopia{''}; a viable
   form of organization that is both economically productive and socially
   welfare enhancing. Conceptualizing democratic firms as organizations
   with formally distributed authority and collectivist norms, we argue
   that democratic firms will operate more productively in knowledge
   intensive industries, compared with conventional firms in the same
   industries, because they give authority to those with relevant knowledge
   and encourage intrafirm information sharing. Next, focusing on intrafirm
   wage inequality as a key social welfare outcome, we argue that
   knowledge-intensive sectors are also settings where the benefits of
   workplace democracy are likely to be greater. Knowledge intensive
   industries tend to generate greater intrafirm inequality through the
   adoption of marketbased employment policies and reliance on unique
   expertise, yet the formal structure and collectivist norms of democratic
   firms are likely to limit thesemechanisms of inequality, generating
   inequality reductions. We test these hypotheses with longitudinal linked
   employer-employee data from French cooperatives and conventional firms,
   including firms that shift organizational structures over time. We find
   robust support for our hypothesis about economic performance andmoderate
   support for our hypothesis about social performance.},

Abstract = {The way in which business ethics change over time will remain

   coevolution and coalignment among a changing environment, transitional
   institutions, strategic adaptations, and performance implications. To
   revitalize this coevolutionary perspective in business ethics research,
   in this special issue, we ask the following question: how do business
   ethics practices coevolve with a changing society and technology
   advancement as a result of the strategic choices of organizations in
   adapting to and shaping the environment? This special issue includes a
   collection of seven empirical studies of business ethics in China that
   differ in methodology and empirical context but collectively showcase
   the change in business ethics practices in an emerging economy and the
   processes underlying this change. Based upon the findings, we propose a
   conceptual model of the coevolution among business ethics practices,
   technological innovation, institutional transition and disruptive
   events; then, we pose questions for future research.},

Abstract = {Gender equity and inclusion has taken center stage in business, science,
   and policy making. We reflect on three systemic challenges that might
   hinder the rise of qualified women scholars to leadership positions in
   business schools: (a) The masculine social structure of business
   schools, (b) a muddled approach to performance evaluation, and (c) an
   under-representation of research topics that affect women in the
   workplace. Drawing on the extant science in gender bias and gender
   equity combined with the collective expertise and experience of the
   author team, we offer 12 actionable solutions for gender-inclusive
   leadership in business schools. We believe that addressing these
   challenges could benefit all members, not just women, because it could
   signal more equitable pathways to multiple business school stakeholders
   and intended beneficiaries, such as students, donors, practitioners, and

Abstract = {We find irregular patterns in the distribution of firms' reported
   quarterly gross margin percentages. Specifically, there is significant
   bunching around percentage integers that are highly round (e.g.,
   multiples of 10, such as 30\%, 40\%, etc.) or are neatly divisible
   (e.g., 25\%, 75\%), compared to what is predicted by counterfactual
   distributions. Further investigation reveals that highly round gross
   margin firms are smaller, exert higher effort, achieve higher
   productivity, have more difficult goals, and pay their CEOs with a
   higher portion of fixed income. We also find that highly round gross
   margins are associated with superior performance. Additionally, we do
   not find consistent evidence that highly round gross margin reference
   points are linked to external rewards. Collectively, our evidence is
   consistent with reference-dependent preferences for highly round gross
   margins likely being driven by intrinsic (rather than extrinsic)
   motivations.},

Title = {Offsetable Derivatives and Investor Risk Assessment},
Journal = {MANAGEMENT SCIENCE},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 JUN 21},
Abstract = {U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) allows banks to
   offset derivative assets against derivative liabilities with the same
   counterparty and report only the net amount on the balance sheet.
   Derivative offsetting under international financial reporting standards
   (IFRS) is much more restrictive, resulting in the single largest
   difference in balance sheet presentation between U.S. GAAP and IFRS. Two
   important factors dominate the standard-setting discussion on this
   issue: (1) whether these derivatives are informative about bank risk and
   (2) whether disclosing them substitutes for recognition on the balance
   sheet. Using a hand-collected global sample of banks, we first show that
   offsetable derivatives are positively associated with bank risk, based
   on multiple risk measures, suggesting that these derivatives are
   informative about bank risk. Next, exploiting the differential
   accounting treatment across U.S. GAAP and IFRS banks, we find that
   disclosure versus recognition of offsetable derivatives matters for the
   risk assessment of equity investors but not for that of (more
   sophisticated) credit default swap investors. Additional tests
   corroborate the inference that investor sophistication helps explain the
   differential investor assessment of recognized versus disclosed
   offsetable derivatives. Collectively, our findings suggest that
   offsetable derivatives convey information about bank risk and that, for
   less sophisticated investors, disclosing them may not substitute for
   recognizing them.},

Title = {Tailor-to-Target: Configuring Collaborative Shareholder Engagements on
   Climate Change},
Journal = {MANAGEMENT SCIENCE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {69},
Number = {12},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {We study collaborative shareholder engagements on climate change issues.
   These engagements involve coalitions of investors pursuing
   behind-the-scenes dialogue to encourage target firms to adopt
   environmental sustainability practices. Drawing on a unique data set of
   553 engagements coordinated by the United Nations-supported Principles
   for Responsible Investment-and an innovative mixed-methods approach
   integrating fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis with regression
   analysis and qualitative interviews-we investigate how four coalition
   composition levers (coalition size, shareholding stake, experience,
   local access) combine to enable or hinder engagement success. We find
   that successful coalitions use four configurations of coalition
   composition levers that are tailored to target firms' financial capacity
   and environmental predispositions, that is, target firms' receptivity.
   Unsuccessful configurations instead emphasize single levers at the
   expense of others. Drawing on qualitative interviews, we identify three
   mechanisms (synchronizing, contextualizing, overfocusing) that plausibly
   underly the identified configurations and provide investor coalitions
   with knowledge about target firms and their local contexts, thus
   enhancing communication and understanding between investor coalitions
   and target firms. Our study contributes an emerging
   ``tailor-to-target{''} theory of collaborative shareholder engagement
   that extends the literature by showing the importance of designing
   investor coalitions for effective climate-related engagement and the
   value of conceiving coalitions as different configurations of the same
   levers that can fit a target firm's receptivity. From a practical
   perspective, our study prompts investors to move beyond
   one-size-fits-all approaches to instead tailor their engagement
   strategies to target firms' receptivity.},

Title = {How the human resource (HR) function adds strategic value: A relational
   perspective of the HR function},
Journal = {HUMAN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {63},
Number = {1},
Pages = {5-23},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {In the present article, we propose the concept of the HR function's
   relational activities and examine its influence on the firm's human
   capital resources (HCRs) and performance. Integrating insights from
   various streams of research in strategic human resource management (HRM)
   and strategic human capital, we develop a relational perspective of the
   HR function and propose the relational activities as the HR function's
   advisory and informative activities toward its internal stakeholders
   (i.e., line managers, employees, and senior managers) to help the
   stakeholders meet their goals and needs. In our framework, we theorize
   how the HR function's relational activities lead to superior firm
   performance by enhancing the firm's HCRs and identify the firm's
   strategic HR systems and human capital losses as factors that complement
   and necessitate the HR function's relational activities, respectively.
   Using a five-wave, nationally representative panel dataset covering 1415
   firm observations, we find robust support for our hypotheses: the HR
   function's relational activities were positively related to HCRs, which
   was more pronounced when coupled with high levels of strategic HR
   systems and human capital losses. The HCRs, in turn, transmitted the
   effects of the relational activities on the firm's subsequent
   operational and financial performance. Overall, these findings develop
   strategic HRM theory by contributing a more comprehensive
   conceptualization of the HR function's role in the strategic HRM process
   and by revealing its effects on firm performance along with key
   moderators.},

Abstract = {This study examines non-Western perceptions of inclusion and exclusion
   through an examination of right mindfulness practitioners in Vietnam. It
   contributes to the critical inclusion literature that problematizes
   inclusion by showing how right mindfulness practitioners rejected the
   concepts of inclusion and exclusion, and moreover, resisted attachments
   to feelings of inclusion or exclusion, treating both states as empty and
   non-enduring. Surprisingly, our study shows how inclusion can generate
   fear at fulfilling others' collective expectations, whereas exclusion
   generated a sense of freedom arising from a release from those
   expectations. Further, our study traces these counter-intuitive findings
   to right mindfulness practitioners' moral reasoning based upon
   Buddhism's canonical philosophical ideas. We conclude by highlighting
   the pressing need for critical perspectives and for further non-Western
   perspectives to inclusion that contribute to a body of cross-cultural

Title = {Mobilizing Conceptual Spaces: How Word Embedding Models Can Inform
   Measurement and Theory Within Organization Science},
Journal = {ORGANIZATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {35},
Number = {3},
Month = {MAY-JUN},
Abstract = {Word embedding models are a powerful approach for representing the
   multidimensional conceptual spaces within which communicated concepts
   relate, combine, and compete with one another. This class of models
   represent a recent advance in machine learning allowing scholars to
   efficiently encode complex systems of meaning with minimal semantic
   distortion based on local and global word co-occurrences from
   large-scale text data. Although their use has the potential to broaden
   theoretical possibilities within organization science, embeddings are
   largely unknown to organizational scholars, where known they have only
   been mobilized for a narrow set of uses, and they remain unlinked to a
   theoretical scaffolding that can enable cumulative theory building
   within the organizations community. Our goal is to demonstrate the
   promise embedding models hold for organization science by providing a
   practical roadmap for users to mobilize the methodology in their
   research and a theoretical guide for consumers of that research to
   evaluate and conceptually link embedded representations with theoretical
   significance and potential. We begin by explicitly defining the notions
   of concept and conceptual space before proceeding to show how these can
   be represented and measured with word embedding models, noting strengths
   and weaknesses of the approach. We then provide a set of embedding
   measurements along with their theoretical interpretation and flexible
   extension. Our aim is to extract the operational and conceptual
   significance from technical treatments of word embeddings and place them
   within a practical, theoretical framework to accelerate research
   committed to understanding how individuals, teams, and broader
   collectives represent, communicate, and deploy meaning in organizational
   life.},

Number = {4, SI},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Intimate partner violence (IPV) is among society's most pernicious and
   impactful social issues, causing substantial harm to health and
   wellbeing, and impacting women's employability, work performance, and
   career opportunity. Organizations play a vital role in addressing IPV,
   yet, in contrast to other employee- and gender-related social issues,
   very little is known regarding corporate responses to IPV. IPV
   responsiveness is a specific demonstration of corporate social
   responsibility and is central to advancing gender equity in
   organizations. In this paper, we draw upon unique data on the IPV
   policies and practices of 191 Australian listed corporations between
   2016 and 2019, that collectively employ around 1.5 M employees.
   Providing the first large-scale empirical analysis of corporate IPV
   policies and practices, we theorise that listed corporations' IPV
   responsiveness reflects institutional and stakeholder pressures which
   are multifaceted and central to corporate social responsibility. Our
   findings identify greater IPV responsiveness among larger corporations,
   as well as those corporations with higher proportions of women middle
   managers, greater financial resources, and more advanced employee
   consultation on gender issues. This paper concludes that there is a need
   for further research on corporate IPV responsiveness, to further
   illuminate corporate motivations, organizational support processes, and
   employee experiences.},

Title = {The interactive effect of organizational identification and reward type
   on reward valuation},
Journal = {CONTEMPORARY ACCOUNTING RESEARCH},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {40},
Number = {3},
Pages = {1733-1759},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Recent management trends highlight two techniques firms use to motivate
   employee effort: (1) fostering employees' organizational identification
   (OI) and (2) offering employees tangible rewards such as gift cards
   instead of cash rewards. We use three studies to examine how OI affects
   employees' reward valuation and how such effects differ depending on the
   reward type. Study 1 is an experiment, demonstrating that increasing OI
   increases the emphasis participants place on a reward's symbolic value,
   which then increases the total value of the reward-to a larger extent
   when the reward is tangible than when it is cash. Study 2 is an
   experiment, providing evidence that Study 1 results are robust to using
   a tangible reward that is not socially consumed, that is selected either
   by the firm or by the employee, and that is either a good or poor fit
   with the employee's personal preference. Finally, Study 3 is a survey,
   asking respondents about actual rewards they received from their current
   employer and capturing their actual OI with their current employer.
   Results in Study 3 are inferentially similar to those in Study 1 and
   Study 2, albeit stronger for rewards of smaller monetary value.
   Collectively, these results highlight the particular benefit of strong
   OI on how employees value tangible rewards relative to cash rewards,
   which should be of interest to incentive system designers.},

   Retail Investors},
Journal = {MANAGEMENT SCIENCE},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 JUN 8},
Abstract = {Using an hourly data set on retail investor individual security
   positions from Robinhood Markets, we find no evidence that
   environmental, social, and governance (ESG) disclosures inform retail
   investors' buy and sell decisions. The response on ESG press release
   days by retail investors is indistinguishable from nonevent days. In
   contrast, these same investors make economically meaningful changes to
   their portfolios in response to non-ESG press releases, especially those
   that pertain to earnings announcements. We use stock return tests to
   show that there is economic content in ESG press releases, and we
   conduct subsample analyses showing that retail investors do not respond
   to the most salient and economically transparent ESG disclosures.
   Collectively, these tests suggest that a lack of economic content, a
   lack of visibility, and difficulty with investment integration are
   unlikely to explain our findings.},

Abstract = {Technological innovation is shaping products and markets to appeal to
   consumer enduring needs. Given the rise in non-physicality of products
   and consumers' increasing participation in peer-to-peer markets, this
   research examines the relationship between non-physicality of goods and
   disparities in seller-buyer valuations, a critical component of market
   inefficiencies. In a meta-analysis of 598 observations across 129
   articles, the authors find that non-physical (vs. physical) goods have
   significantly larger seller-buyer valuation disparities (i.e., larger
   endowment effects). This pattern is consistent across non-physical
   categories, including market and non-market goods. The authors argue the
   immateriality of non-physical goods reduces evaluability and enhances
   perceived complexity, leading to greater asymmetries in information
   processing between sellers and buyers. Congruent with construal level
   theory, marketing tactics associated with low categorization levels
   (emphasizing product features) influence consumer valuations of physical
   goods, but not non-physical goods. Instead, consumer valuations of
   non-physical goods are asymmetrically influenced by tactics with high
   categorization levels (accentuating collective identity). This research
   foreshadows challenges in, and provides managerial implications for, the
   marketing and transactions of non-physical products.},

Title = {Audit partner ethnicity and salient audit phenomena},
Journal = {ACCOUNTING ORGANIZATIONS AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {107},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Motivated by ongoing dialog at the national level on racial
   (in)equality, we examine the relations be-tween audit partner ethnicity
   (audit partners of Asian, Black, or Hispanic origin) and three salient
   audit phenomena. Specifically, we examine whether there is a difference
   in financial reporting quality between the clients of ethnic minority
   audit partners (EMAPs, hereafter) and those of White partners, whether
   EMAPs face a different work environment than their White counterparts,
   and how EMAPs are treated in the audit firm. We find that clients of
   EMAPs, on average, have earnings that are more predictive of future cash
   fiows, have smaller unsigned discretionary accruals, and are less likely
   to receive a comment letter from the U.S. Securities and Exchange
   Commission than clients of White partners. We also find weak evidence
   that clients of EMAPs have more persistent earnings, lower signed
   discretionary accruals, and higher audit fees. We do not find evidence
   of differences in restatement likelihood between the clients of EMAPs
   and those of White partners. Overall, these results provide some
   evidence that clients of EMAPs have higher financial reporting quality.
   Next, we find that, compared to White partners, EMAPs are more likely to
   work in offices that are smaller, earn lower audit fees, are non-Big 4,
   and have no prestigious clients. Finally, we find that EMAPs are more
   likely to be in charge of engagements with clients whose top management
   (but not whose audit committee) has ethnic representation. We find no
   evidence that EMAPs are less likely to be engaged with prestigious or
   important clients. However, we find that, following a financial
   restatement, EMAPs are more likely than White audit partners to be
   replaced. Collectively, our findings suggest that even though EMAPs 1)
   tend to work in less desirable offices, 2) have a client alignment that
   is affected by ethnic representation in the client's top management, 3)
   face more severe consequences after audit failure, they are associated
   with some properties of higher audit quality. This study is one of the
   first to broadly examine important aspects of the work of EMAPs. We
   believe that our findings will be of interest to audit firms, audit
   clients, other related parties, and society at large, especially given
   audit firms' efforts to improve ethnic diversity.\& COPY; 2023 Elsevier

Journal = {ADMINISTRATIVE SCIENCE QUARTERLY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {68},
Number = {3},
Pages = {734-780},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Most literature on aesthetic innovation has focused on single producers
   who use radical aesthetic innovation to differentiate their products.
   However, a few scholars, as well as anecdotal evidence, suggest that
   when gazed at from the category level, aesthetic innovation usually
   occurs as incremental variations of a dominant aesthetic. Extant theory
   fails to account for why we see cycles of shift and stability in the
   dominant aesthetic of a category. In this study, we identify the
   mechanisms that drove such shifts and stability in the dominant
   aesthetic of the hearing aid category from 1945 to 2015. Leveraging this
   study, we develop theory showing that alignment or misalignment between
   category meanings and recent cultural trends spurs producers to generate
   new categorical aspirations to associate their category with new sets of
   meanings. However, producers introduce radical new aesthetic innovations
   only when a change in product form allows them to experiment. Examining
   aesthetic evolution at the category level helps to shed light on
   category-level patterns of aesthetic shifts and stability, why attempts
   to differentiate outside the dominant aesthetic are rare, and why
   product aesthetics across a category shift synchronously between
   dominant aesthetics. Furthermore, we enhance understanding of the roles
   of culture in category evolution and of aesthetics in the construction
   of category meaning, and we show how such meanings are periodically and
   collectively renegotiated in mature categories.},

Title = {Regulating Gender Diversity: Evidence from California Senate Bill 826},
Journal = {MANAGEMENT SCIENCE},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 JUN 5},
Abstract = {Do gender diversity quotas enhance firm value? This broad question has
   sparked significant debate because, whereas diversity is generally
   thought to improve board functioning, prior research in international
   settings suggests mandating diversity may have adverse consequences if
   it moves firms away from market equilibrium. Exploiting the political
   events leading up to the passage of California Senate Bill (SB) 826 as
   an exogenous shock to assess the market implications of board gender
   composition, we document either significantly positive or insignificant
   two-day abnormal returns for California firms across a variety of model
   specifications. Importantly, this finding contradicts the strong claims
   of contemporary studies of SB 826 that the California mandate was
   value-destructive. We reconcile these findings by providing critical
   evidence that contemporaneous results lack robustness to alternative
   model specifications and provide an incomplete picture by failing to
   comprehensively examine a broader set of event dates or account for
   mixed messaging on the final event date. We also provide some evidence
   of significant negative abnormal returns to litigation milestones that
   threaten to overturn SB 826 with the magnitude increasing in the size of
   board gender deficits. Finally, we provide evidence that there is no
   observable decline in newly appointed female director quality following
   the implementation of SB 826 relative to either preregulation or male
   director appointments. Collectively, our results suggest nonnegative (if
   not positive) consequences to California firms arising from SB 826 and
   directly counter assertions that mandated gender diversity is
   detrimental to firm value.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT},

Volume = {50},

Abstract = {Despite increasing attention to gender diversity on corporate boards, we
   have only limited understanding of what occurs within the boardroom when
   women are present. Prior empirical research has used various theories to
   infer how board gender diversity may influence firm outcomes, but
   without identifying the theoretical mechanisms underlying women
   directors' influence on the board. To address this gap, we conducted
   interviews with women and men who have collectively served as directors
   with over 200 publicly listed companies in the United States and Europe.
   While prior research has suggested that the diverse cognitive
   perspectives women directors bring influence board decision-making, our
   study reveals novel insights as to the underlying mechanisms.
   Specifically, we contribute to the board gender diversity literature
   with the finding that women behave in ways contrary to existing board
   norms. By coming to board meetings highly prepared, being willing to
   acknowledge that they do not know something, asking questions, and
   getting things on the table, women impact the dialogue and interactions
   in the boardroom. Thus, our study sheds light on how the presence of
   women influences board dynamics, which has implications for corporate
   governance. Our findings also challenge prevailing gender theories as to
   how women are likely to behave, in that we do not find that women
   conform to gender stereotypes. Yet, we also find impediments to women
   directors' ability to gain influence, in that men directors may not
   always acknowledge them or afford them respect as equal board members.},

Abstract = {To date, customer education has been framed in terms of one-way
   information provision, at odds with much of the literature on meaning
   co-creation. Drawing on an ethnography of a specialty coffee purveyor,
   we show how staff and consumers co-create educational consumer journeys
   through the deployment of seven practices: auditing, realignment,
   marrying competing logics, negotiating scripts, evangelizing, expanding
   collective knowledge, and impression management. These practices require
   staff and consumers to enact three different educational roles
   (educator, student, and peer), which are necessary for the co-creation
   and extension of consumer journeys. The roles, practices and the
   journeys themselves emerge iteratively through sensebreaking,
   sensegiving, and sensemaking processes among staff, consumers and the
   servicescape. Our findings frame customer education as a dynamic process
   in which meaning is co-created between participants. Furthermore, the
   cues and touchpoints needed for meaning-making shift as power relations
   between participants change. Managerially, these findings highlight the
   potential of co-created educational consumer journeys to expand
   established market categories.},

Abstract = {We examine whether auditors share private information about some clients
   in their portfolio to benefit other clients (i.e., brokerage houses).
   This is a salient issue in China, where there are concerns about
   auditors leaking information to related parties, and where we observe
   variation in connectedness between brokerage houses and companies
   through shared auditors. We document that brokerage houses that share an
   auditor with a company issue comparatively more accurate earnings
   forecasts for that company. Next, cross-sectional variation in forecast
   accuracy is associated with several proxies for brokerage houses' and
   auditors' costs and incentives to share information (e.g., investor
   protection, media coverage, public listing status, and the client's
   economic importance). Finally, auditors are more likely to secure future
   audits from IPO deals sponsored by brokerage house clients with higher
   forecast accuracy. Collectively, our evidence is suggestive of auditors
   sharing private information with brokerage houses in anticipation of
   reciprocity in the form of lucrative future engagements.},

   how a unit-relevant shock affects the collective turnover response
   across time. In doing so, we identify and explain a potential delay

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Hadi et al. (Journal of Consumer Psychology, 34, 2023) have created a
   masterful and wide-sweeping review of the consumer behavior literature
   on the Metaverse. They envision our encounter with the Metaverse as a
   consumer journey. In this commentary, I highlight some of their unique
   contributions and suggest additional insights that emerge when we view
   the digital frontier as a liminal place betwixt and between now and
   then, here and there, and reality and virtuality. The Metaverse is also
   a metaphor and I entertain three metaphoric interpretations. First, the
   Metaverse is an experience machine of the sort that Robert Nozick
   imagined in his thought experiment involving real and artificial
   pleasures. Alternatively, consumers themselves can be seen as desiring
   machines as Gilles Deleuze and Feliz Guattari characterized them, and
   the Metaverse can be seen as an instantiation of our collective desires.
   Or thirdly, the Metaverse can be regarded as a shared hallucination. As
   these diverse metaphors suggest, imagining the metaverse is a projective
   exercise. But the consequences may involve up to a trillion dollars in
   revenues, so I hope these provocations prove useful whether they are
   ultimately borne out or not.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ETHICS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {192},
Number = {1},
Pages = {21-37},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {This paper studies consumers' reactions and resistance to being
   responsibilized for making climate-friendly food choices. While
   resistance to consumer responsibilization has been studied from an
   individual experiential perspective, we examine its collective
   characteristics. We do this by tracing the controversial marketing
   campaign of a Swedish poultry producer, encouraging consumers to ``do
   something simple for the climate{''} by eating chicken rather than beef.
   In our analysis of social media comments and formal complaints to the
   consumer protection authority, we mobilize Foucault's notion of
   counter-conduct to analyse subtle forms of resistance to consumer
   responsibilization. We identified four interrelated yet distinct forms
   of consumer counter-conduct: challenging truth claims, demanding `more,'
   constructing `the misled consumer,' and rejecting vilification. By
   theorizing these counter-conducts, we demonstrate how consumers
   collectively contested both the means and ends of responsibilization-but
   not the underlying premise of individualized responsibility. Thus, our
   study helps to explain how consumers' resistance reproduces, rather than
   undermines, responsibilization.},

Abstract = {We study the economic impact of private equity (PE) investments on local
   governments, which are important corporate stakeholders. Examining over
   11,000 deals and private firm data in Europe, we document that target
   firms' effective tax rates and total tax expenses decrease by 15\% and
   13\% after PE deals. At the same time, target firms expand their capital
   expenditures and firm boundaries, but do not increase employment. Using
   administrative data on the public finances of German municipalities and
   exploiting the geographical and time-series variation in PE deals, we
   document that PE activity is negatively associated with local
   governments' tax revenues and spending. This result is likely driven by
   reduced tax payments of PE portfolio firms, accompanied by only modest
   positive spillovers of PE investments on regional economic growth.
   Collectively, our findings suggest that corporate tax efficiency serves
   as a cost-cutting channel in the PE sector and constrains the finances
   of local governments.},

   A cultural examination of how female managers resolve shock events in

Journal = {HUMAN RELATIONS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {77},

Abstract = {How do key cultural aspects of individualism/collectivism and gender
   egalitarianism shape the decision making of female managers from
   developing regions when handling major work-family conflicts (WFC)? We
   address this question by drawing on a qualitative study of 50 female
   managers from developing countries in Asia, Latin America, and
   sub-Saharan Africa who work in one particular male-dominated industry.
   We examine the major WFC incidents experienced by our study participants
   through the theoretical lens of work-life shock events outlined by
   Crawford et al. We contribute to the episodic approach to WFC research
   by shedding light on important aspects of the sociocultural role of
   extended families and the collectivistic values prevalent in developing
   regions, as well as on pervasive (low) gender egalitarian norms. The
   accounts of our female managers reveal how major events are perceived
   and how women use multifaceted methods to handle them, allowing us to
   propose a decision-making framework and associated cues with three broad
   types of decision making: (1) self-directed-choosing work; (2)
   consultative-choosing work; and (3) consultative-choosing family.
   Alongside this, we offer revealing insights into how the abovementioned
   cultural aspects help to shape the logic of consequences (through which
   people assess the impact of alternative actions) and the logic of
   appropriateness (through which people act according to their identity),
   thereby influencing WFC decision making during major episodes of
   conflict.},

Title = {Moral Agency Development as a Community-Supported Process: An Analysis

Abstract = {This paper investigates the process of moral agency development as a
   community-supported process. Based on a multimethod qualitative inquiry,
   including diaries, focus groups, and documentary analysis, we analyze
   the experiences of middle managers in two Norwegian hospitals during the
   first year of the COVID-19 pandemic. We find that moral agency is
   developed through a community-embedded value inquiry, emerging in three
   partially overlapping steps. The first step is marked by moral reflex,
   an intuitive, value-driven, pre-reflective response to a crisis
   situation. In the second step, the managers involved the community in
   value calibration, a collective-ethical sensemaking. In the third step,
   they took active stances to translate values into actions, with an
   increased awareness of values and an ability to explain and justify
   their actions. We label the steps, respectively: value
   inquiry-in-action, value inquiry-on-action and reflective enactment of
   value. An analysis of the process reveals two aspects critical for moral
   agency development: it happens through confrontation with uncertainty,
   and it is relational, that is, embedded in a community. While
   uncertainty forces an intuitive moral response, dialogical reflection in
   the community develops value awareness and relationships of mutual care
   and support.},

Abstract = {In this study, we draw on signalling theory to examine the
   organization-level relationship between reputation and employee movement
   in and out of organizations. Focusing on organizations' media
   reputations relative to their peers, we map all employee flows between
   organizational dyads in a population of English hospitals. We find
   support for our main argument that an organization's relative reputation
   predicts employee mobility above and beyond what can be explained by its
   absolute level of reputation. In particular, our findings suggest that
   the number of employees moving between two organizations is highest when
   both organizations have a high reputation. We refer to this as the
   elites' mutual attraction effect (EMA-effect). We also find that the
   motives of voluntary leavers and geographical distance between two
   organizations influence the strength of this EMA-effect. Overall, this
   study shows that developing and testing dyadic theory can extend
   research on organizational reputation and collective turnover in
   meaningful ways.},

   (Mis)management in Teams},
Journal = {ORGANIZATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {35},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN-FEB},
Abstract = {This paper examines how teams manage temporal ambivalence, or the
   simultaneous and conflicting perceptions of time as a resource,
   including how much time has passed and whether there is enough of it
   left. Team members' time perceptions influence how a team manages time;
   thus, effective time management requires some collective resolution of
   temporal ambivalence. To study the effects of temporal ambivalence on
   time management processes and performance in teams, we conducted a
   laboratory study in which we manipulated perceptions of time by
   engineering a wall clock to run at different speeds (normal, fast, or
   slow) to instantiate different types of temporal ambivalence. Using both
   quantitative and qualitative analyses, we found that managing temporal
   ambivalence effectively is essential for teams to appropriately allocate
   time to different phases of work. Specifically, teams often misallocated
   their time by either transitioning too late or too early between phases
   of work, both of which were associated with worse team performance than
   transitioning closer to the temporal midpoint. Teams with heightened
   temporal ambivalence were more likely to manage time poorly following
   one or more of three dysfunctional patterns: bypassing comments,
   glossing over contradictions, and following passively. By contrast,
   teams that managed temporal ambivalence effectively did so through time
   management huddles, in which team members briefly and collectively took
   time away from the main task to explicitly discuss how to allocate their
   time. We discuss the implications of these findings for research on team
   process, ambivalence, and time management in organizations.},

Abstract = {This research explores how marketers can best persuade consumers to act
   in a collective goal context, such as giving to a donation campaign or
   signing a petition. The authors examine whether consumers respond
   differently to fact-based versus affect-based persuasive messages at
   different stages of a collective campaign. Seven studies demonstrate
   that the relative impact of fact-based versus affect-based appeals
   changes with varying distance to the completion of the collective goal.
   Whereas a fact-based message better persuades consumers to support a
   collective goal when the distance to completion is large (i.e., far from
   completion), an affect-based message better persuades consumers to
   support the goal when the distance to completion is small (i.e., near
   completion). This enhanced persuasion occurs because the psychological
   state triggered by the remaining distance matches the message type and,
   in turn, encourages deeper processing of the appeal.},

Abstract = {In 2005, the SEC suffered a high-profile loss in its first court case,
   SEC v. Siebel Systems, Inc., in an effort to enforce Regulation Fair
   Disclosure (Reg FD). We examine the impact of this loss on managers'
   selective disclosure to sell-side analysts. We provide evidence that the
   informativeness of analyst reports increased after the Siebel decision,
   especially for observable instances of private meetings. This finding
   suggests that such selective disclosure increased significantly after
   the court's decision. Our results also suggest that the increased
   selective disclosure faded as the SEC resumed enforcement actions
   related to Reg FD in 2009. In exploratory analyses, we survey and
   interview law firm partners to investigate possible mechanisms for our
   results; their responses suggest that the Siebel outcome reduced manager
   concern about liability from selective disclosure. Collectively, our
   results highlight how the anticipated costs of regulatory enforcement
   affect private information flow from managers to analysts in particular.},

Year = {2023},
Volume = {61},
Number = {4},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Using Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) inspection data
   from 2006 to 2018, we examine the use of auditor-employed specialists in
   audit engagements. First, we find that the use of specialists is
   increasingly prevalent and related to clients' size and complex
   accounting estimates. Second, the use of specialists is positively
   associated with the incidence of audit process deficiencies (identified
   by PCAOB inspections) but is not associated with output-based
   audit-quality proxies (restatements or absolute discretionary accruals).
   Hence, although process deficiencies are more likely to occur in
   engagements with higher use of specialists, financial reporting quality
   is not negatively impacted. Third, the use of specialists is positively
   associated with the likelihood of goodwill impairments and negatively
   associated with engagement profitability. Finally, cross-sectional tests
   suggest that board accounting expertise is a salient condition for more
   effective use of specialists. Collectively, our findings align with
   concerns noted by the PCAOB and prior experimental and survey studies.
   Although specialists assist auditors with the audit of complex
   estimates, engagements with comparatively high specialist use entail an
   incremental risk of audit process deficiencies.},

Abstract = {The pursuit of social goals and ethics in business creates challenges.
   Sustained efforts to address poverty, environmental degradation or
   health/wellbeing require meaningful and transformative responses that
   impact across multiple levels-individual, community and the global
   collective. Shifting predominant paradigms to facilitate change entails
   a renegotiation of business strategy-between organizations, their
   purpose(s), individual and collective stakeholders and ultimately with
   society at large. Hybrid organizations such as social enterprises are
   positioned to affect such change. However, in balancing divergent goals
   such organizations encounter tensions and paradox, creating a duality of
   ethics. Utilizing in-depth interviews to develop a case within the
   sustainable fashion industry, we identify tensions and paradox within
   women-oriented hybrid organizations. Significantly, managing these
   tensions and paradox results in multiple dualities of ethics, often with
   a wider impact on organizational founders/managers. We find three
   interrelated ethical dualities: business strategy and personal values;
   financial sustainability and holistic sustainability; and business,
   employee, societal wellbeing, and personal wellbeing. This insight is
   noteworthy when looked at within the broader context of sustainability
   and highlights the importance of sustainability in women-oriented hybrid
   organizations.},

   of terror occurs predominantly on the Web. Radical ideologies can be
   spread, in many cases unchecked, by malicious actors who take advantage
   of the fre-quently lax surveillance apparatus of online social
   platforms. This paper argues that an overlooked, essential first step to
   interdicting this threat is the large-scale, structured collec-tion of
   knowledge regarding these ideologies in open machine-readable formats.
   Using Collective Action Framing Theory, this study develops a trio of
   design artifacts: the Terror Beliefs Ontology (TBO) for a general
   ontology of terroristic ideology, the Frame Discovery System (FDS) to
   automatically populate this ontology, and the Frame Resonance Detection
   System (FRDS) to accurately identify online personae or postings that
   espouse a radical ideology known to TBO. With a comprehensive
   evaluation, we demonstrate how these three instantiated design
   artifacts, working in concert, can automatically construct a knowl-edge
   representation of heterogeneous terroristic ideologies and accurately
   detect radical online postings. We offer the first design that can
   assign Web text to any radical ideology without the use of a
   hand-labeled training corpus.},

Abstract = {Research has provided limited knowledge of how people in organizations
   experience growth of agency during circumstances that seem hopeless and
   stuck, and how such growth emerges. Drawing from the study of the
   turnaround processes at a nursing home and the Pragmatism of Dewey and
   Mead, we contribute with a theory of how agency is produced in social
   inquiry. We suggest that the puzzling accounts of lightness in the
   experiences of people at this nursing home help explain how a field of
   social inquiry may be charged with creative and agentic force. We show
   how agency emerged through a series of action sequences related to
   inviting people into inquiry through the opening of a troublesome
   situation, the resulting voicing of needs and ideas for improvement, as
   well as the subsequent experimenting and surfacing of tales of
   meaningful progress from such actions. Furthermore, our empirical
   observations suggest that the emergence of collective desire to meet the
   needs of the Generalized Other is a central, yet understated, part of
   agency produced through social inquiry. Lightness of agency may be
   accentuated, paradoxically, by the weight of a more generalized
   situation - in this case that of institutionalized care for elderly -
   that the local inquiry exemplifies and in which it resonates.},

   and Team Gender Composition},
Journal = {ORGANIZATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {34},

Month = {MAY-JUN},
Abstract = {Collective intelligence (CI) captures a team's ability to work together
   across a wide range of tasks and can vary significantly between teams.
   Extant work demon-strates that the level of collective attention a team
   develops has an important influence on its level of CI. An important
   question, then, is what enhances collective attention? Prior work
   demonstrates an association with team composition; here, we additionally
   examine the influence of team hierarchy and its interaction with team
   gender composi-tion. To do so, we conduct an experiment with 584
   individuals working in 146 teams in which we randomly assign each team
   to work in a stable, unstable, or unspecified hier-archical team
   structure and vary team gender composition. We examine how team
   structure leads to different behavioral manifestations of collective
   attention as evi-denced in team speaking patterns. We find that a stable
   hierarchical structure increases more cooperative, synchronous speaking
   patterns but that unstable hierarchical struc-ture and a lack of
   specified hierarchical structure both increase competitive,
   inter-ruptive speaking patterns. Moreover, the effect of cooperative
   versus competitive speaking patterns on collective intelligence is
   moderated by the teams' gender compo-sition; majority female teams
   exhibit higher CI when their speaking patterns are more cooperative and
   synchronous, whereas all male teams exhibit higher CI when their
   speaking involves more competitive interruptions. We discuss the
   theoretical and practical implications of our findings for enhancing
   collective intelligence in organiza-tional teams.},

Volume = {77},

Abstract = {This article examines the role of strategic leadership groups in radical
   organisational change. Previous research has focused on how `heroic'
   individual leaders guide change. In contrast, we argue that strategic
   leadership groups are indispensable to understanding and supporting
   radical organisational change. Building on a longitudinal study in a
   global European company, our research identifies four phases of
   `negotiated order' that shape group and organisational responses to
   change. Our findings reveal that strategic leadership groups help manage
   emotions and understand the shifting authority relations that inevitably
   arise during periods of change. Drawing upon the psychoanalytic concept
   of `projective identification', we develop a theoretical framework for
   understanding the tensions of change. The model shows how emotional
   coalitions that develop in strategic leadership groups afford a source
   of political and psychological containment against the anxieties of
   radical organisational change. These formations offer transitional
   spaces for change, providing opportunities for progress. The advantage
   of this new perspective on radical change is that it helps to move the
   organisation beyond periods of ambivalence and conflict, with positive
   implications for leadership practice.},

Abstract = {Social norms of responsibility are shared beliefs on what constitutes
   responsible behavior, and they play a significant role in determining
   CSR. This study analyzes how social norms of responsibility permeate
   corporate boundaries and influence CSR through political leaders,
   corporate executives, employees, and the public. Socially irresponsible
   behaviors of the above populations are used as proxies for local social
   responsibility norms and related to CSR ratings for firms headquartered
   in the twenty largest U.S. metro areas. The empirical results show that
   firms headquartered in cities with more responsible social norms exhibit
   higher ESG scores even after controlling for various demographic,
   regional, and economic factors. Social responsibility norms encourage
   firms to be more responsible but are ineffective in deterring
   irresponsible corporate behaviors. Corporate and political leaders are
   the essential channels through which social norms of responsibility
   influence CSR, highlighting the importance of instituting regulations
   and setting high ethical standards for political and business leaders.
   This study also demonstrates that social norms have a significant impact
   on firms with leaders who are more susceptible to local social norms
   (i.e., local leaders) than non-local leaders. In addition, this study
   documents a negative bias for responsible social norms in that they
   condemn irresponsible behaviors more than reward responsible ones.
   Collectively, the above findings underline the importance of social
   norms of responsibility in shaping CSR and provide additional insights
   into societal motivations for CSR.},

Abstract = {Smart city projects require complex coordination of resources, but
   research on how capabilities form at the city-ecosystem level remains

   ecosystem-level capabilities - data provisioning and data insights -
   developed through global, configural and shared aggregation processes.
   We find that the emergence process changes as the smart city ecosystem
   develops, requiring different coordination and resource mobilisation
   mechanisms at various stages. We contribute to the capability
   development and smart city literatures by focusing on ecosystem-level
   capabilities linked to collective city-level outcomes rather than the
   capabilities of the leading city authority. Insights from the study are
   of value to city authorities considering how to scale up and organise

Abstract = {While Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) is often seen to involve
   voluntary and deliberative approaches such as certification, governments
   have recently stepped into the picture through national legislation.
   France's Law on Duty of Vigilance adopted in 2017 is a landmark case of
   such legislation. Years of voluntary CSR certification schemes led by
   Civil Society were replaced by a new philosophy of fighting for
   mandatory CSR controlled by a judge. We depict the change of mindset and
   the related change of roles inside the coalition of Civil Society actors
   represents a Machiavellian Moment. The combination of collective civil
   society actors' roles (namely nongovernmental organizations and labor
   unions) as Machiavellian Virtue with disruptive events as Machiavellian
   Fortuna made the law's adoption possible. Based on this case study, we
   provide an analysis of civil society roles in the development of

Abstract = {A large and growing body of organizational behavior (OB) research has
   adopted what can be termed an ``event-oriented{''} perspective. Broadly
   speaking, this stream of research focuses on discrete, change-oriented
   events that occur at different hierarchical levels as well as the impact
   of such events on employee outcomes. This event-oriented OB research
   stands in contrast to the traditional focus on the enduring features of
   people and collectives. Although event-oriented OB research has become
   increasingly prominent and influential, a systematic and integrative
   review of this important domain has yet to be conducted. Event-oriented
   OB research has utilized a wide range of theoretical and methodological
   perspectives, leading to a fragmented and disconnected literature. A
   synthesis of extant event-oriented OB studies is needed to obtain a more
   integrated and holistic view of this domain. In the present review, we
   propose a four-level framework to enhance our understanding of the types
   of events studied and synthesize insights from event-oriented OB
   studies. With this understanding and synthesis, we highlight promising
   theoretical and methodological opportunities for future research. In
   sum, our review facilitates a more systematic and refined understanding
   of events and can assist future event-oriented OB research by
   highlighting novel avenues for theoretical extensions and methodological
   improvements.},

Title = {Affective Resonance and Durability in Political Organizing: The case of

Abstract = {We explore the role of affect in fuelling and sustaining political
   organizing in the case of an online type-1 diabetes community. Analysing
   this community's interactions, we show that the drive towards political
   transformation is triggered by affective dissonance, but that this
   dissonance needs to be recurrently enacted through the balanced
   circulation of objects of pain and hope. We propose the notion of
   affective resonance to illuminate the dynamic interplay that
   collectively moderates and fosters this circulation and that keeps
   bodies invested and reverberating together around shared political
   goals. Affective resonance points researchers toward the fragile and
   complex accomplishment that affective politics represents. Focusing
   particularly on the community's interactions on Twitter, we also reflect
   on the role of (digital) resonance spaces in how affects circulate. By
   adopting and transposing concepts from affect theories into the context
   of patient communities, we further add important insights into the
   unique embodied challenges that patients with chronic illness face.
   Highlighting the hope induced by techno-bodily emancipation that
   intertwine into a particular form of political organizing in such
   healthcare movements, we give emphasis to patient communities' deeply
   embodied affects as important engines for political, social and economic
   change.},

Abstract = {We introduce a novel application of machine learning to compare pooling

   securities. In contrast to the view that the PSA is largely boilerplate
   text, we document substantial variation across PSAs, both within- and
   across-underwriters and over time. A part of this variation is driven by
   differences in loan collateral across deals. Additionally, we find that
   differences in PSAs are correlated with ex post loan and bond
   performance. Collectively, our analysis suggests the importance of
   examining the entire governing document, rather than specific
   components, when analyzing complex financial securities.},

Volume = {61},

Abstract = {This paper studies whether and how environmental, social, and governance
   (ESG) disclosure regulations imposed on banks generate transmission
   effects along the lending channel. I use a setting of U.S. firms
   borrowing from non-U.S. banks and exploit the staggered adoption of ESG
   disclosure regulations in banks' home countries. I find that exposed
   borrowers of affected banks improve their environmental and social
   (E\&S) performance following the disclosure mandate. Consistent with
   banks enhancing both their engagement and selection activities, affected
   banks impose more environmental action covenants in loan contracts, and
   they are more likely to terminate a borrower with bad E\&S records
   following the regulation. Further evidence shows that the transmission
   effects are stronger when a disclosure regulation is well-enforced (as
   indicated by a greater increase in banks' disclosure) and among
   borrowers with greater switching costs. Collectively, the findings
   document the role of lending relationships in transmitting the real
   effect of ESG disclosure regulations from banks to borrowing firms.},

Abstract = {This paper develops a new concept, entrepreneurial political activity
   based on corporate political activity to understand when an
   entrepreneur, representing both the firm and the individual
   simultaneously, will engage in political activity. The case of petty
   traders in Kumasi, Ghana generates grounded theory of entrepreneurial
   political activity. Faced with an existential threat, informal
   entrepreneurs had to decide whether to try to influence government
   policy by engaging in political activity. Findings from over 200
   interviews demonstrated entrepreneurs carefully considered the state's
   willingness to allow for the extra-legal economic activity in the
   informal economy to continue, and if they had trust in the leadership of
   the collective action before engaging in political action. Policy
   saliency motivating action was determined by growth orientation and
   dependency on the venture for household survival, both driven by the
   entrepreneur's social role in the social system.},

Volume = {108},
Number = {9},
Pages = {1486-1514},

Abstract = {Although human capital resources (HCR) can be important for
   organizational performance, researchers have defined and measured HCR in
   various ways. Consequently, it is unclear whether existing measures
   provide valid inferences about HCR or their relations with other
   constructs. We conducted this three-study research to address these
   issues. In Study 1, we reviewed HCR definitions (k = 84) and found that
   most definitions focus on collective knowledge, skills, and abilities.
   Recent definitions also tend to include other characteristics (e.g.,
   personality). In Study 2, a content analysis of HCR measures (k = 127)
   revealed that only 23.6\% of the measures focused solely on HCR and they
   tended to assess only one or two dimensions of the construct (i.e., were
   deficient). Many measures (46.5\%) assessed both HCR and other
   constructs (i.e., were partially contaminated), and other measures
   (29.9\%) assessed only non-HCR constructs (i.e., were fully
   contaminated). In Study 3 (k = 94), we found that HCR measures that were
   less deficient demonstrated stronger criterion-related validity for
   predicting unit and firm performance. Interestingly, partially
   contaminated measures were somewhat more predictive than uncontaminated
   measures (? = .35 vs. .25, respectively), mainly because they assessed
   both HCR and other constructs that are related to performance. Both
   types of measures demonstrated stronger validity than fully contaminated
   measures. Overall, findings suggest that extant HCR measures often are
   deficient and/or contaminated. We discuss implications, as well as offer
   guidance for measuring HCR in future research.},

Title = {Losing Sleep Over Speaking Up at Work: A Daily Study of Voice and
   Insomnia},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF APPLIED PSYCHOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 APR 6},
Abstract = {Organizational scholars have examined a number of antecedents of
   insomnia in a search for ways to prevent insomnia and its negative
   implications for the workplace. However, most studies have focused on
   the antecedents that are beyond employee control. Therefore, our
   collective understanding of how employees can modify their workplace
   behaviors to reduce the symptoms of insomnia and prevent its adverse
   consequences has remained limited. In this study, we examined whether
   the expression of voice, as a prosocial yet psychologically costly
   behavior that is under employee control, affects employee sleep quality,
   and whether sleep quality affects the expression of voice on the next
   workday. Having surveyed 113 full-time employees twice a day for 10
   workdays, we found that employees who express promotive voice at work
   experience higher positive affect at the end of the workday, more
   effectively detach from work in the evening, and are less likely to
   suffer from insomnia at night. We also found that employees who express
   prohibitive voice at work experience higher negative affect at the end
   of the workday, less effectively detach from work in the evening, and
   are more likely to experience insomnia at night. Our study further
   demonstrates that, while insomnia is not related to the expression of
   prohibitive voice on the next day, sleep-deprived employees are less
   likely to engage in promotive voice because of being psychologically
   depleted. The results of our study suggest that sleep problems might be
   mitigated if employees regulate their engagement in costly workplace
   behaviors, such as voice.},

Title = {Being on the Same Page Matters: A Meta-Analytic Investigation of
   Leader-Member Exchange (LMX) Agreement},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF APPLIED PSYCHOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 APR 6},
Abstract = {Although leader-member exchange (LMX) theory offers a detailed account
   of leader-follower relationship building, the importance of LMX
   agreement as a theoretically meaningful relational phenomenon has
   received less attention. This has, in turn, limited scholarly
   understanding of its pivotal role in leader-follower relationships. We
   conducted a meta-analysis to synthesize the substantive implications of
   LMX agreement for leader-follower relationships and to further
   understand which factors may influence its variation across samples.
   Results from the random-effects metaregression analyses provided strong
   support for the moderating role of LMX agreement at the between-study
   level. Specifically, with higher levels of sample-level LMX agreement,
   the relationships between LMX and followers' task performance and
   organizational citizenship behaviors were stronger. Moreover, different
   national culture configurations (i.e., horizontal individualism vs.
   vertical collectivism) and changes in relationship tenure were
   significantly associated with LMX agreement. We also examined a host of
   methodological factors, which generally had a very limited impact on the
   study findings. Overall, these meta-analytic findings suggest LMX
   agreement should be considered as a key relational contingency in LMX
   theory, as it can help unlock the full potential of high-quality
   leader-follower relationships. Moreover, as a substantively meaningful
   phenomenon, its variation across situations is intricately related to
   contextual influences. Based on our theoretical integration and
   empirical synthesis, we discuss the implications for LMX theory and
   identify important directions for the next stages of LMX research.},

Abstract = {We theorized and tested how both team-assessed leader group
   prototypicality (i.e., followers' collective perceptions of the extent
   to which a leader is viewed as being representative of the group
   prototype) and leader-team congruence on this factor relate to leader
   identity threat. We also proposed that leader identity threat,
   subsequently, negatively affects both leadership effectiveness and team
   performance, and that leader perceptions of organizational support
   mitigate the relationships. Using a multi-source and time-lagged survey
   design to collect data at the leader (team) level from 402 group members
   and their 90 group leaders, the results generally support our research
   hypotheses. For example, both team-assessed leader group prototypicality
   and leader-team congruence on leader group prototypicality negatively
   relate to leader identity threat. In addition, the effects of leader
   identity threat on leadership effectiveness and team performance were
   weaker when leader perceptions of organizational support were higher
   rather than lower.},

Abstract = {Stakeholders self-identify with a firm when they believe they affect and
   are themselves affected by the actions of a firm. When a firm is already
   operating and engaging in actions that are more or less consistent with
   its business model, stakeholders can evalu-ate whether they are affected
   or whether they affect the firm. However, how do stake-holders
   self-identify in the earliest stages of an entrepreneurial endeavor when
   a firm has yet to exist and the outcomes of products and services and
   their effects on stake-holders are unknown? In these early, uncertain
   stages, human cooperation is needed for new ideas, language to describe
   these ideas, products and services, and entrepre-neurial endeavors
   emerge. Using the theory of common ground helps scholars examine how
   everyday human conversations, cooperation, and social interactions can
   motivate a subset of individuals to self-identify as stakeholders in
   relation to ideas, language, future products and services, and even the
   endeavor before outcomes can be known. These endeavors, the negotiated
   construction of language and mutual coherence, exist because of an
   emerging stakeholder collective identity. Finally, the paper proposes
   that how an endeavor is organized is the manifestation of the unique
   path-dependent pro-cesses the stakeholders have gone through.},

Abstract = {The timely flow of financial information is critical for efficient
   capital market functioning, yet we have little understanding of firms'
   and auditors' collective abilities to maintain timely financial
   reporting when under duress. We use COVID as a stress test case to
   examine whether reporting systems can withstand systemic increases in
   complex economic events and coordination challenges. Despite
   COVID-related challenges persisting through 2020 and beyond, we document
   surprisingly modest average delays in financial reports during COVID and
   only in Q1-2020. Reporting timeliness reverts to pre-COVID levels no
   later than Q2-2020. We find no evidence of meaningful declines in actual
   reporting quality during COVID, but we do find some evidence consistent
   with declines in perceived reporting quality. Overall, our findings
   indicate that current financial reporting processes are remarkably
   robust and provide insights about financial reporting more broadly. In
   particular, given that nearly all firms were able to weather the
   unprecedented disruptions caused by COVID, our findings imply that most
   material reporting delays observed outside of COVID are likely a result
   of either a firm's strategic choices or exceptionally fragile reporting
   processes.},

Abstract = {Actors without formal power can initiate and shape organizational change
   through issue-selling as a means to address their concerns about
   organizational practices. The lit-erature has emphasized the need for
   perspective-taking and found discontent to be asso-ciated with
   inhibiting fear. Based on a longitudinal field study of middle managers
   trying to instigate strategic renewal in six different manufacturing
   companies, we find that discontent can also energize issue-selling,
   particularly if sellers and-recipients also engage in
   perspective-taking. We identify three different genres of issue-selling
   and enacting discontent that are jointly shaped by sellers
   and-recipients: (a) productive con-frontation, (b) avoiding escalation,
   and (c) collective moaning. In a process model of issue-selling as
   framing, mobilizing, and pursuing, we illustrate how the genres form
   part of an organization's collective repertoire of initiating and
   responding to change. Our findings have implications for pursuing
   change, as well as for managers seeking to create a constructive
   environment for expressing discontent.},

Year = {2023},
Volume = {48},

Pages = {313-335},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {The value of human capital resources (HCR) is widely recognized, but
   relatively little is known about their creation. Research conceptualizes
   HCR emergence as enabled through shared states that form in response to
   environmental conditions. Although this view implies that social
   interactions play a role in creating HCR, theory currently fails to
   clar-ify how social interactions act as key facilitators of the
   emergence process. This limitation persists partly because the structure
   and content of the social interactions are unac-counted for, making it
   impossible to fully understand and predict when HCR will be gen-erated
   through the HCR emergence process. To address this deficiency, we draw
   from social capital literature to develop HCR emergence theory. This
   theory brings needed pre-cision to theoretical perspectives on HCR
   emergence by proposing how unique features of social interactions
   influence the creation of HCR through the emergence process.},

Title = {ENTREPRENEURIAL VISIONS AS RHETORICAL HISTORY: A DIEGETIC NARRATIVE

Journal = {ACADEMY OF MANAGEMENT REVIEW},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {48},
Number = {2},
Pages = {220-243},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Research suggests that entrepreneurs persuade stakeholders to engage in
   risky projects in an uncertain future through visions, compelling
   narratives of the future. A unique challenge for entrepreneurs, however,
   is how entrepreneurs can construct a narrative that unites stakeholders
   with different perceptions of the degree of risk or uncertainty posed by
   the future. We address this question with a diegetic narrative model of
   stake-holder enrollment. Our primary argument is that, to reduce
   variation in how potential stakeholders view the future, a story must
   embed a vision of the future in a coherent and collectively held
   narrative of the past. We introduce rhetorical history as the primary
   construct through which this occurs. We demonstrate how successful
   visions employ his-torical tropes at the intradiegetic level to appeal
   to individual perceptions of risk or uncertainty and how those
   historical tropes are combined into meta-narratives or myths drawn from
   the collective memory of a community to create broad, extradiegetic
   appeal to broader categories of potential stakeholders with
   heterogeneous temporal orienta-tions. Finally, we describe three
   categories of historical reasoning-teleology, present -ism, and
   retro-futurism-that act as bridging mechanisms between past, present,
   and future that provides stakeholders with an enhance sense of agency in
   the future.},

Title = {PAY TRANSPARENCY AS A MOVING TARGET: A MULTISTEP MODEL OF PAY
   COMPRESSION, I-DEALS, AND COLLECTIVIST SHARED VALUES},

Abstract = {Drawing from research on the transparency-privacy dilemma in management,
   we theorize that firm-level pay transparency elicits a multistep process
   involving managers and employees that shifts the dispersion in
   remuneration from more to less observable forms, thus making pay
   transparency a ``moving target.{''} We posit a serial indirect effect of
   pay transparency on firm-level rates of i-deal grants (a less observable
   form of remuneration) via variable pay compression and heightened rates
   of employee i-deal requests, with this indirect effect amplified in
   firms characterized by collectivist shared values. First examining the
   role of managerial agency and collectivist shared values in the pay
   transparency-compression relationship in a simulation-based experiment,
   we test the overall model in a multisource field study using a sample of
   111 medical device distribution firms. Our findings demonstrate that:
   (a) firm-level pay transparency is predictive of greater pay
   compression, (b) firm-level rates of i-deal grants are largely explained
   by this pay compression via its effects on employee i-deal requests, and
   (c) this sequential effect is amplified in firms with more collectivist
   shared values. Accordingly, we explicate how transparency triggers
   unintentional hiding, and suggest that accompanying more transparent pay
   may be an increased reliance upon rewards that, by their very nature,
   are less transparent.},

Title = {Conflict, Chaos, and the Art of Institutional Design},
Journal = {ORGANIZATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {35},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN-FEB},
Abstract = {The metaphor of an organization as a garbage can is often invoked as a
   playful insult. However, as was recognized early on by management
   theorists studying garbage can ideas, the unpredictability arising from
   garbage can decision making has the potential to be adaptively rational
   for organizations facing complex task environments. The chaos produced
   by preference conflict and fluid participation in collective decision
   making can aid in search by enabling organizations to escape local
   performance peaks or competency traps. The decades old hypothesis that
   conflict and chaos could promote adaptively rational search, however,
   has largely been overlooked in research on organizational design. This
   paper uses an agent-based model to evaluate these competing views and,
   in the process, identify conditions under which garbage can decision
   making is adaptively rational for executives searching for high-quality
   strategies. I show that the biased and chaotic outcomes that emerge as a
   result of garbage can decision making-the very features of garbage cans
   that lead them to be perceived to be dysfunctional-can facilitate
   short-term exploitation and long-term exploration of uncertain technical
   landscapes when organizations engage in serial judgment of local
   alternatives if internal conflict over desired outcomes is not too
   extreme. I conclude that decision-making routines that encourage chaotic
   conflict are robust to bounded rationality and complex task uncertainty
   and thus should be included in the organizational designer's portfolio.},

Title = {Social Media Alleviates Venture Capital Funding Inequality for Women and
   Less Connected Entrepreneurs},
Journal = {MANAGEMENT SCIENCE},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {70},
Number = {2},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Start-ups are increasingly using social media to signal quality and
   provide information to potential investors. However, the effectiveness
   of social media on venture capital (VC) financing is likely to be
   heterogeneous, differing by demographic and network characteristics of
   the founders. In this paper, we examine whether social media use can
   improve funding outcomes for firms founded by women and by other people
   also lacking connections to the investor network, two groups that face
   greater difficulties in securing VC financing. Using Twitter data and
   data on VC investment in start-ups from Crunch base, we explore the
   interaction effect between Twitter usage and gender and between Twitter
   usage and the network constraint measure. Overall, we show that social
   media can mitigate some disparities in financing experienced by these
   firms through improving information access. We find that this effect is
   stronger for first-time entrepreneurs than for experienced ones,
   stronger for attracting new investors than repeat ones, and stronger in
   more competitive markets. Collectively, these results suggest that
   social media could primarily help women and less connected individuals
   obtain financing by alleviating information asymmetry between founders
   and investors.},

Abstract = {Inadequate nurse staffing continues to challenge healthcare delivery in
   the United States. In this research, we undertake a fine-grained,
   unit-level analysis to understand the relationships between nurse
   staffing, nurse turnover, and pressure ulcers, the latter of which is a
   key nursing-sensitive care quality indicator. We examine these
   relationships within two types of hospital units: intensive care units
   (ICUs) and medical-surgical (MedSurg) units, which have unique patient
   mixes and needs. Using hospital unit-level data between 2008 and 2017,
   we show that nurse staffing primarily affects nurse turnover in ICUs,
   and that the adverse effects of nurse turnover on care quality tend to
   be stronger in ICUs than in MedSurg units. These findings provide
   important theoretical insights into the varying roles of staffing,
   turnover, and quality across organizational units. The findings suggest
   that hospital administrators may prioritize staffing needs for ICUs over
   MedSurg units to maintain strong quality performance on measures such as
   pressure ulcers. Further, our study reveals that staffing requirements
   for ICUs may be inadequate compared with MedSurg units. Thus, there is a
   need to evaluate existing guidelines on ICU staffing.},

   Using a unique confidential labour contract-level dataset matched with

   monetary policy announcements, the higher the degree of wage rigidity.
   Hand-collected information on the periods across renegotiations of

Abstract = {We combine matched employer-employee data with firms' financial records

   of temporary contract workers while maintaining rigid employment
   protection regulations for employees hired under permanent contracts.
   Exploiting the staggered implementation of the reform across different
   collective bargaining agreements, we find that this policy change led to
   an increase in the share of temporary contracts but failed to raise
   employment. The reform had both winners and losers. Firms are the main
   winners as the reform was successful in decreasing labor costs, leading
   to higher profits. By contrast, young workers are the main losers since
   their earnings were substantially depressed following the policy change.
   Rent-sharing estimates show that temporary workers receive only
   two-thirds of the rents shared by firms with permanent workers, helping
   explain most of the labor costs and earnings reductions caused by the
   reform.},

Abstract = {This study provides insights into the efficacy of FASB ASC 250 by
   examining the impact of material changes in accounting estimates (MCEs)
   on the usefulness of earnings. We find that MCEs, on average, increase
   the usefulness of earnings measured by the predictive ability of
   earnings for future cash flows and investor responsiveness to earnings
   news. Although the results suggest that some firms time their
   implementation of MCEs to meet desired earnings targets, we also find
   that ASC 250 disclosures attract investors' and regulators' scrutiny,
   suggesting that MCEs are a costly earnings management tool.
   Collectively, our findings provide limited support for the widespread
   use of MCEs for earnings management and suggest that this use is much
   more nuanced than suggested by prior research. Finally, notwithstanding
   the benefits of ASC 250 disclosures, our descriptive analysis of related
   disclosures of accounting estimates suggests that there is room for
   further improvements in current disclosure practices and regulatory
   monitoring.},

Abstract = {A growing body of research has examined the construct of bottom-line
   mentality (BLM), which captures a tunnel vision focus on securing
   bottom-line outcomes to the disregard of competing work priorities. We
   offer a systematic review of the literature to summarize current
   knowledge of BLM, what is missing in the literature, and key
   opportunities for advancing our theoretical understanding of the
   construct. Our review first defines and conceptualizes BLM and then
   organizes past BLM findings according to the key sources of BLM: (a)
   leader, (b) employee, and (c) collective BLM. When applicable, research
   on each source of BLM is synthesized with respect to its most prevalent
   theoretical frameworks and in relation to its (a) outcomes, (b)
   antecedents, and (c) instances whereby BLM serves as a moderator. Our
   discussion then examines the critical ways in which BLM research can
   advance with the most theoretical rigor. We first discuss whether there
   is value in studying a BLM with respect to non-financial, bottom-line
   outcomes. Second, we question whether BLMs always (or mostly) foster the
   desired bottom-line outcome. Third, we provide theoretical arguments
   that support BLM as a potentially activated psychological state that is
   driven by context and suggest specific contexts that could be the
   driving forces of BLMs at work. Finally, we discuss the ways in which
   BLM research can improve methodologically, including a suggestion of how
   to revise the current BLM measure to advance BLMs with respect to
   non-financial, bottom-line outcomes.},

Abstract = {This conceptual paper presents the analytical theory of agency (ATA), an
   overlooked philosophical approach to the concept of action, to develop
   its theoretical basis in routines research in which the constructs of
   action and agency play crucial roles. It expounds, in the framework of
   ATA, the ideas of the spectrum of intentionality, kinds of action, and
   collective agency, which help advance the rigor of action-theoretical
   concepts in routines research as well as reveal the rationale of the
   microfoundational approach to routine actions. To uncover the
   developmental potential of ATA, the article discusses the most crucial
   conceptual challenges for routines research; it also briefly examines
   the limitations and future work related to using ATA in the management
   field.},

Abstract = {In addressing social issues, organizations have a responsibility to
   promote diverse participation, yet often struggle to harness the
   benefits of racial and gender diversity. Using a community-based
   participatory research design, with data collected over an 18 month
   field study, we examined how a social change organization, FoodLab,
   facilitated diverse collaboration. FoodLab aimed to grow a good food
   economy in Detroit, Michigan, through working with their members, local
   food entrepreneurs. We found that recurrent episodes of practicing
   dialogue catalyzed collaborative action around multiple issues,
   including shared kitchens, licensing, and membership. Practicing
   dialogue included intentional convening, participatory devices, and
   collective language. While leaders set up the initial procedures and
   rules, leaders and members, together, enacted these structures. Through
   high quality interactions, participants developed additional resources,
   knowledge, motivation, and relationships. Across episodes of practicing
   dialogue, traces of high quality interactions supported sustained effort
   around social issues. Our findings demonstrate the dynamic aspects of
   organizational structure and individual action in working towards
   diverse collaborative action.},

Title = {When Images Backfire: The Effect of Customer-Generated Images on Product
   Rating Dynamics},
Journal = {INFORMATION SYSTEMS RESEARCH},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {34},
Number = {4},
Pages = {1641-1663},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Customer-generated images (CGIs) on e-commerce platforms have been
   widely adopted as a promotional tool to persuade customers into
   purchases. Despite their prevalent applications, the effect of CGIs on
   customer postpurchase satisfaction has not been extensively examined.
   This study postulates that CGIs could cause expectation disconfirmation
   and reduce product uncertainty for customers, therefore making their
   effect on subsequent product ratings complex. We leverage multiple
   methods and data sets to gain a better understanding of this problem and
   underlying mechanisms. We employ a difference in-differences model to
   empirically test our hypotheses and find that CGIs lead to a decline in
   subsequent ratings compared with product ratings not exposed to CGIs.
   Further heterogeneity analyses demonstrate that high CGI review rating
   and high aesthetic quality exacerbate the negative effect, whereas
   reviewer face disclosure could alleviate the negative effect. Through
   cross-product analyses, we find that the negative effect is more
   prominent for experience goods (e.g., women's dresses) than for search
   goods (e.g., lightning cables). Finally, the underlying mechanism is
   further validated through a laboratory experiment that shows
   participants experience significantly higher expectation and more
   negative disconfirmation in the CGI group with high review ratings,
   whereas uncertainty reduction effect is insignificant, which
   collectively explains the decline of subsequent product ratings. These
   findings suggest that platforms and retailers should be aware of the
   potential negative effect of CGIs on the rating dynamics and take
   appropriate measures to circumvent it.},

Journal = {ORGANIZATIONAL BEHAVIOR AND HUMAN DECISION PROCESSES},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {175},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Popular press and theoretical conjecture imply that curiosity is not
   just an individual motivation but also an enabler of collective actions.
   This study seeks to explicate curiosity as a catalyst for collective
   actions by examining team supervisors' trait curiosity. We test the idea
   that trait curiosity predisposes team supervisors to manipulate
   team-level task structures, which primes certain forms of team
   regulatory focus and eventually af-fects team innovation. Two studies
   using the interest/deprivation (I/D) taxonomy of curiosity revealed
   that, by predisposing supervisors to create more learning demand, I-type
   curiosity primes team promotion focus, which facilitates both radical
   and incremental team innovation. By predisposing supervisors to create
   more problem -solving demand, D-type curiosity arouses team prevention
   focus, which facilitates team incremental innova-tion but hinders
   radical innovation. The effect of supervisor curiosity is evident only
   when supervisors have high task authority. This study uncovered a
   powerful property of curiosity, demonstrating its promising
   contributions to organizational life.},

Abstract = {We show that information exposure through international business
   networks enables firms to take proactive measures that benefit employees
   and potentially the local community. Specifically, in the early days of
   COVID-19, firms that have business networks with China and Italy are
   more likely to be aware of the severity of the disease, and proactively
   implement work-from-home ({''}WFH{''}) policies that can protect their
   employees. Using Safegraph foot traffic data, we find a higher
   stay-at-home ratio before local governments impose lockdowns in zip
   codes where firms have a larger information exposure. These areas are
   also associated with a lower spread of COVID-19. Our main findings are
   more pronounced when local governments face constraints in quickly
   responding to COVID-19 and when firms have a higher WFH capability or
   have more investors with socially responsible preferences. Collectively,
   we present evidence on the role of private corporations in mitigating
   the negative effects of a public health crisis before government
   intervention.},

Abstract = {Social inequalities are partly caused by habitual organizational
   practices. In this vein, to overcome those, organizations now need to
   develop new organizational capabilities aimed at enhancing their
   attention towards societal issues. In our study, we apply the theory of
   mindfulness to explain how it may help organizations overcome habitual
   organizing that fuels social inequalities. Guided by the
   microfoundational perspective of organizational capability, we
   conceptualize individual characteristics, processes, and structures that
   collectively form mindfulness capability for social justice. We perceive
   it as an organizational capability that reflects the extent to which an
   organization possesses a collective social justice awareness, i.e.,
   awareness of the impact on social justice in society through its
   organizational practices. We argue that, when adopted by organizations,
   mindfulness, by increasing the awareness of the organizational impact on
   society, helps notice, examine, and question the correctness of
   taken-for-granted organizational practices. From our perspective, this
   new capability will lead to changes in organizational practices that
   fuel social inequalities. Our study contributes to the literature on
   sustainable organizational development and mindfulness research in
   organizations. Managerial implications and future research directions
   are also discussed.},

Abstract = {Franzoni and Stephan (2023) recommend a probabilistic `subjective
   expected utility' technique for addressing challenges of uncertainty in
   research evaluation. Whilst acknowledging strengths in F\&S's analysis,
   this Response highlights a series of important practical, theoretical
   and methodological deficiencies. The stakes are raised, in that these
   are widely shared in a growing body of practice across research policy
   and beyond. This practice seeks to reduce and aggregate real-world
   complex, ambiguous, qualitative, multidimensional and contested
   challenges through ostensibly precise calculation. Taking associated
   problems in turn, this Response shows how F\&S: make scientifically
   dubious claims; understate the depths of uncertainty; overstate the
   sufficiency of quantification; neglect foundational limits to
   calculation; and ignore crucial interpretive dimensions of policy
   making. High-lighting roles for greater methodological diversity, this
   Response points at the end to alternative methods that collectively
   allow more robustly plural approaches to contrasting aspects of
   incertitude. In the process, the steering of directions for research can
   become more rigorous and accountable and less vulnerable to
   manipu-lation and inadvertent bias. With globally growing `post-truth'
   authoritarian populism arguably partly provoked by the kind of
   technocracy criticised here, research evaluation may in a small way help
   re-invigorate democracy by `opening up' in this particular area, the
   hiding of politics behind expertise.},

Title = {The Role of Moral Anger in Social Change Efforts},
Journal = {ORGANIZATION STUDIES},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {45},
Number = {2},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Drawing upon the functional account of emotions-the view that emotions
   can facilitate adaptive responses-I analyze how Javed Abidi harnessed
   moral anger to promote inclusion of persons with disabilities in India.
   The data comprise articles obtained from digital archives covering the
   period from 1993, when Abidi began his work, to 2018, when he passed
   away. Findings suggest that harnessing moral anger can facilitate social
   change through two mechanisms: disciplined collectivization wherein
   aggregated stakeholders can appraise injustice; and enabling collective
   enactment wherein they can redress injustice by choosing if, when, and
   how to effect change. Despite ongoing propriety breaches, moral anger
   can remain functional when stakeholders can balance their immersion
   across initiatives and can perceive change as a beneficial proxy for or
   an expansion of existing values. As such, the study contributes by
   drawing attention to the theoretical significance that a functional
   account has for expanding the literature on moral anger as it applies
   within the context of social change.},

Title = {How Resilient Are Firms? Financial Reporting Processes?},
Journal = {MANAGEMENT SCIENCE},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 FEB 7},
Abstract = {The timely flow of financial information is critical for efficient
   capital market functioning, yet we have little understanding of firms'
   and auditors' collective abilities to maintain timely financial
   reporting when under duress. We use COVID as a stress test case to
   examine whether reporting systems can withstand systemic increases in
   complex economic events and coordination challenges. Despite
   COVID-related challenges persisting through 2020 and beyond, we document
   surprisingly modest average delays in financial reports during COVID and
   only in Q1-2020. Reporting timeliness reverts to pre-COVID levels no
   later than Q2-2020. We find no evidence of meaningful declines in actual
   reporting quality during COVID, but we do find some evidence consistent
   with declines in perceived reporting quality. Overall, our findings
   indicate that current financial reporting processes are remarkably
   robust and provide insights about financial reporting more broadly. In
   particular, given that nearly all firms were able to weather the
   unprecedented disruptions caused by COVID, our findings imply that most
   material reporting delays observed outside of COVID are likely a result
   of either a firm's strategic choices or exceptionally fragile reporting
   processes.},

Title = {Theorizing Organizational Benevolence},
Journal = {ORGANIZATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {34},
Number = {5},
Month = {SEP-OCT},
Abstract = {We extend research on stakeholder orientation by introducing and
   conceptualizing ``organizational benevolence{''}-a notion that refers to
   a firm's inclination to pursue the welfare of an external stakeholder
   group as an end in itself manifested in a behavioral tendency in which
   benefiting the ``other{''} is the ultimate goal of action. Employing a
   microfoundational approach, we propose a theoretical framework and a
   process model that explain how firms develop such a posture and how it
   eventually can become an enduring feature of these organizations. We
   build our framework on the core notion of collective commitment to the
   well-being of an external constituency by elaborating on the processes
   through which such collective commitment is mobilized, translated into
   collective intention, and stabilized in a behavioral tendency. Our
   article develops several propositions highlighting the crucial roles
   that emotionality and rhetoric play in these processes, alongside an
   enabling sociocognitive infrastructure. Overall, our work goes
   substantially beyond current theorizing and provides a detailed account
   for why some firms not founded with a prosocial mission nonetheless act
   consistently to benefit an external constituency in the absence of
   instrumental reasons to do so.},

Title = {Firm exit from open multiparty alliances: The role of social influence,
   uncertainty, and interfirm imitation in collective technology
   development},
Journal = {RESEARCH POLICY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {52},
Number = {4},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {This study examines exit dynamics in open multiparty alliances, an
   important form of interfirm collaboration that includes committee-based
   standard-setting organizations, research and technology consortia, and
   other types of open meta-organizations. Open multiparty alliances differ
   markedly from more commonly studied dyadic alliances and closed
   multiparty alliances due to the open nature of membership and the broad
   diversity firms that collaborate towards shaping the trajectory of
   emerging technologies in a sector. Drawing from liter-ature on interfirm
   imitation, we posit that under conditions of elevated uncertainty about
   the technologies under development and the ability of diverse alliance
   members to work together effectively, firms are subject to social
   influence from their industry peers and thus tend to imitate them in
   exiting open multiparty alliances. However, we also argue that firms
   that are central in the wider network of alliances have access to
   superior information sector developments as well as key resources that
   immunize them from such social influence effects. Analyses the exit
   dynamics of the nine most influential open multiparty alliances that
   shaped the global mobile phone sector between 2000 and 2012 support our
   predictions. Our findings contribute to research on interfirm
   collaboration in technology-intensive contexts, in particular on open
   collaboration between multiple partners.},

Abstract = {This study examines whether analysts have an industry-level information
   advantage over managers when forecasting earnings. While analysts are
   often viewed as industry experts, prior research fails to document such
   an advantage. We predict that analysts' industry-level information
   advantage is more likely to exist in industries where firm performance
   is more sensitive to industry-level external economic forces. We find
   that for such firms, analysts provide relatively more accurate earnings
   forecasts compared to managers. Consistent with our predictions, we
   further find that managers of such firms provide fewer and less precise
   forecasts and that this association is more pronounced in firms with
   higher analyst following. Collectively, these findings suggest that
   analysts have an industry-level information advantage over managers when
   forecasting earnings for firms in industries with high sensitivity to
   external forces, and that industry sensitivity risk is a distinct
   industry characteristic that affects firm-level disclosure.},

Abstract = {We examine the response of individual investors to firms' adoptions of
   SFAS 109 - Accounting for Income Taxes. We predict that SFAS 109 reduces
   disclosure-processing costs and provides new decision-useful
   information, reducing the information disadvantage of individual
   investors relative to more sophisticated investors. Using monthly
   individual investor stock holdings data and staggered firm adoptions of
   SFAS 109, we provide evidence that individual investors increased their
   holdings in firms following adoption of SFAS 109. The increases are
   concentrated among more financially knowledgeable individual investors
   and among individual investors that are more likely to trade on
   financial statement information. We provide evidence that the increased
   demand among individual investors following SFAS 109 adoption is
   concentrated in firms with (i) tax attributes associated with less
   informative disclosures under the prior standard and (ii) substantive
   improvements to balance sheet reporting of deferred taxes and tax
   disclosures following SFAS 109 adoption. Results of a path analysis
   suggest that SFAS 109 adoption aided individual investors directly and
   indirectly via a decrease in analyst forecast dispersion. Collectively,
   the evidence is consistent with SFAS 109 benefitting individual
   investors by improving the accessibility and informativeness of
   financial reporting on income taxes. Our findings highlight the
   importance of evaluating how improved accounting standards can benefit a
   key stakeholder of the SEC and FASB: individual investors.},

Abstract = {The current research advances understanding of how consumers respond to
   embarrassing service encounters. Across a combination of field and
   online studies, the authors provide evidence that (1) consumers prefer
   self-service to human services when purchasing embarrassing products or
   services; (2) when self-service is not available, consumers respond more
   positively to a mechanistic service provider than to a personable
   service provider; and (3) if consumers must engage in embarrassing
   social interactions, they dehumanize service providers, perceiving them
   as more mechanistic and less capable of emotional reactions than when
   engaging in nonembarrassing service interactions. The authors also
   examine consumers' familiarity with the service provider as a boundary
   condition for the effect. Collectively, the results provide converging
   evidence for the proposed framework and have substantive implications

Title = {Organization-as-Platform Activism: Theory and Evidence from the National

Abstract = {Social activists sometimes engage in a form of workplace activism that
   involves using their employer organization as an unofficial platform to
   communicate social issue messages to external stakeholders. This type of
   activism follows a different logic from that of more-familiar citizen
   activism, in which citizens directly target society and its
   institutions, and that of organizational-change activism, in which
   employees aim to influence their employer organization. This article
   develops and tests theory to understand this phenomenon of
   organization-as-platform activism, using the National Football League
   ``Take a Knee{''} employee athlete protests as an empirical context.
   Drawing on past research on social movements and employee activism, we
   offer a theoretical comparison of these three forms of activism-citizen,
   organizational-change, and organization-as-platform-to conceptually
   distinguish them and to theorize factors that uniquely predict the
   occurrence of platform activism. We find evidence of predictors
   associated with the attributes of the organizational platform and those
   of the intended stakeholder audience. Organization-as-platform activism
   is associated with the accessibility and openness of the organizational
   platform for messaging use, the visibility of the organizational
   platform for message transmission, and the receptivity of the targeted
   stakeholder audience. As employees increasingly bring their non-work
   identities and beliefs into the workplace, our findings invite new
   research on the outcomes of platform activism for organizations, the
   implications of such activism for organizational stakeholder strategy,
   and the relation between platform activism and employee prosocial voice.},

Journal = {REVIEW OF ACCOUNTING STUDIES},

Volume = {29},
Number = {2},
Pages = {1147-1191},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {We examine how the culture of origin of sell-side financial analysts in
   the United States influences their forecasting. We find that analysts
   from individualistic cultures are more likely to issue bold earnings
   forecasts and stock recommendations than analysts from collectivist
   cultures. Individualistic (collectivist) analysts' tendency to
   overweight (underweight) their private information at least partly
   explains the results. The effect of culture decreases with the analysts'
   professional skills and their exposure to the U.S. culture but increases
   with task difficulty. For market consequences, short-window market
   reactions are stronger to bold reports by collectivist analysts than to
   those by individualistic analysts, consistent with the analysts'
   differential weighting of their private information. On average,
   however, a higher level of analyst individualism is associated with
   lower stock price synchronicity of the firm covered, indicating that
   more firm-specific information is impounded in the stock price. Our
   study extends research on the effect of national culture in the capital
   market by demonstrating how individualism, a central element of culture,
   affects analysts' information processing and the value of their work.},

Abstract = {This article emerged through ethnographic research into strike action at
   a UK university. It provides three insights. First, it adds to the
   literature linking humour to resistance that has largely focused on
   subterranean, disguised, hidden, camouflaged or decaf opposition. The
   resistant humour explored in this case is more diverse and challenges
   extant distinctions because it was overt and covert, individual and
   collective, decaf and `real'. Second, it posits that during strike
   action the already ambiguous distinction between humour and seriousness
   becomes even more blurred. Third, it contributes to our understanding of
   power-resistance relations through introducing the term solidaristic
   humour which conveys a neglected expression of opposition that reflects
   and seeks to galvanize solidarity.},

Title = {How Social Media Influencers Impact Consumer Collectives: An

Journal = {JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {50},
Number = {3},
Pages = {617-644},
Month = {SEP 15},
Abstract = {Research has documented the emergence of embedded entrepreneurs within
   consumer collectives. This phenomenon is increasingly prevalent as
   social media enables ordinary consumers to become social media
   influencers (SMIs), a distinct form of embedded entrepreneur. Whilst
   research has considered the implications of embeddedness for embedded
   entrepreneurs themselves, we lack insight into embedded
   entrepreneurship's impact on consumer collectives. To address this gap,
   we draw from a longitudinal, qualitative study of the YouTube beauty
   community, where SMIs are pervasive. Informed by interactionist role
   theory, we document the Polanyian ``double movement{''} prompted by the
   emergence of SMIs within the community. We demonstrate that the economy
   within the community was initially highly embedded, constrained by
   behavioral norms linked to established social roles. SMIs' attempts to
   disembed the economy created dysfunctional role dynamics that reduced
   the benefits of participation for non-entrepreneurial community members.
   This prompted a countermovement whereby SMIs and their followers
   attempted to re-embed SMIs' economic activity via role negotiation
   strategies. Our analysis sheds new light on the negative implications of
   embedded entrepreneurship for non-entrepreneurial members of consumer
   collectives, highlights the role of social media platforms in
   negotiations of embeddedness, and advances wider conversations
   surrounding the evolution of consumer collectives and the impact of
   SMIs.},

Title = {Boosting the Wisdom of Crowds Within a Single Judgment Problem: Weighted
   Averaging Based on Peer Predictions},
Journal = {MANAGEMENT SCIENCE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {69},
Number = {9},
Pages = {5128-5146},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {A combination of point estimates from multiple judges often provides a
   more accurate aggregate estimate than a point estimate from a single
   judge, a phenomenon called ``the wisdom of crowds.{''} However, if the
   judges use shared information when forming their estimates, the simple
   average will end up overemphasizing this common component at the expense
   of the judges' private information. A decision maker could in theory
   obtain a more accurate estimate by appropriately combining all
   information behind the judges' opinions. Although this information
   underlies the judges' individual estimates, it is typically unobservable
   and thus cannot be directly aggregated by a decision maker. In this
   article, we propose a weighting of judges' individual estimates that
   appropriately combines their collective information within a single
   estimation problem. Judges are asked to provide both a point estimate of
   the quantity of interest and a prediction of the average estimate that
   will be given by all other judges. Predictions of others are then used
   as part of a criterion to determine weights that are applied to each
   judge's estimate to form an aggregate estimate. Our weighting procedure
   is robust to noise in the judges' responses and can be expressed in
   closed form. We use both simulation and data from a collection of
   experimental studies to illustrate that the weighting procedure
   outperforms existing methods. An R package called metaggR implements our
   method and is available on the Comprehensive R Archive Network.},

Journal = {HUMAN RELATIONS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {77},
Number = {5},
Pages = {593-621},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Grand challenges require coordinated and integrated responses that draw
   on different occupational communities' competencies that might otherwise
   remain in isolation. We theorize how grand challenges can be tackled by
   mobilizing landscapes of practice - a totality of local communities that
   constitute a `living knowledge area' within a given domain. The
   landscapes of practices concept helps to understand the deployment of
   participatory architectures, which in the current literature is
   considered essential for addressing grand challenges. To this end,
   landscapes of practice emphasize the mutual accountability between
   networks and communities across informal and institutional settings and
   the need to learn about the landscapes of practice rather than focusing
   only on developing local competencies. Thus, landscapes of practice
   mobilization is complex and requires collective practical judgment while
   facing the arising socio-political tensions. Drawing on a study focused
   on Australian mental health care, we propose four pillars enabling the
   mobilization of landscapes of practice, and constituting general guiding
   principles - determining and legitimizing the landscapes of practice's
   purpose, deploying landscapes of practice-based governance structures,
   motivating and connecting membership across the landscapes of practice,
   and demonstrating the value of the mobilized landscapes of practice.
   Thereby, we propose a framework of mobilizing landscapes of practice
   that serves as a reference for network leaders and managerial practice
   while advancing the academic debates on grand challenges and situated
   learning.},

Title = {Targeting Advertising Spending and Price on the Hotelling Line},
Journal = {MARKETING SCIENCE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {42},
Number = {6},
Pages = {1057-1079},
Month = {NOV-DEC},
Abstract = {Are competing firms better off with more targeting? We examine this
   question in the context of targeting advertising spending and price in
   the Hotelling model. By ``more targeting,{''} we mean expanding the
   scope of targeting from one of these variables to both. When the
   incremental cost of such expansion is small, the question boils down to
   whether the firms are better off targeting both advertising spending and
   price ({''}full targeting{''}) or just one of them ({''}partial
   targeting{''}). We show that it is individually rational for the firms
   to expand the scope of targeting in such circumstances. However, their
   profits may or may not be higher in the resulting full targeting
   equilibrium. The paper identifies the conditions under which each type
   of targeting is collectively optimal. Targeting advertising spending
   only is optimal when the products are highly differentiated; however,
   when product differentiation is small, full targeting is optimal when
   the cost of advertising is small, and targeting price only is optimal
   when the cost of advertising is large. These results provide managerial
   guidance on how firms should respond to any restrictions on the scope of
   targeting imposed by regulators or online retail platforms. On the
   theoretical front, our results show that expanding the scope of
   targeting has benefits and costs for the firms. The benefits come from
   being able to align local advertising levels to local prices-what
   Dorfman and Steiner's theorem says firms should do. The costs come in
   the form of more intensified price competition, which takes different
   forms depending on which type of targeting is added. When price
   targeting is added to advertising spending targeting, it has the effect
   of replacing product differentiation by informational differentiation;
   when advertising spending targeting is added to price targeting, it has
   the effect of delegating control of the local price equilibrium to the
   weaker firm. Comparing our results with those of previous results
   suggests that targeting on preferences may be fundamentally different
   from targeting on loyalty and switching behaviors.},

Abstract = {There is an impressive literature on organizational capacities that
   enable specific types of performance, but no work has been done on
   whether such capabilities extend to an organizational capacity for
   trustworthiness (CFT). This paper introduces the notion of a capacity
   for trustworthiness (CFT) defined as the collective capability of the
   organization to produce positive signals of trustworthiness to
   stakeholders. The antecedents to the CFT are bundles of organization
   routines that enable the firm to manifest trustworthiness and balance
   attending to both financial and relational goals. The consequences of a
   high CFT are outcomes and behaviors that are congruent with pivotal
   stakeholder expectations and are, therefore, trust inducing. A process
   model is offered that outlines how an organization's routines and CFT
   change in response to feedback and pressure and increase or decrease
   stakeholders' trust. Implications for the management of stakeholder
   relations, trust repair, and the management of organizational systems
   are reviewed.},

Title = {REVIEW ESSAY ANTIGONE: ON PHRONESIS AND HOW TO MAKE GOOD AND TIMELY
   LEADERSHIP DECISIONS},
Journal = {ACADEMY OF MANAGEMENT REVIEW},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {48},
Number = {1},
Pages = {149-164},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {In this paper I examine the ancient wisdom on how to make good
   leadership decisions that Antigone offers. Creon, Antigone's ruler,
   preconizes the traditionally masculine leadership conduct, with
   hubristic tyrannical tendencies, that deliver tragic consequen-ces.
   Antigone schools Creon and the audience, firstly, by identifying the
   behaviors and circumstances that favor bad and untimely leadership
   decisions. Then Antigone presents the wisdom of phronesis as the way
   forward for good and timely leadership decisions. Phronesis is a
   pragmatic, measured rationality that comprises prudence, and a
   sensibility to the context, openness to dialogue, and to the other.
   Phronesis also calls for an open and flexible relation to error, to
   changing one's mind. The focus is not merely on the leader but on the
   relations, their differences, and opportunities, and what everyone
   involved in the specific circumstances of the decision can offer when
   listening and learning from one another. Phronesis becomes part of a
   modus operandi that prefigures collaborative leader-ship. Collaborative
   leadership is predicated on the collective and individual flourishing
   central to the dawn of democratic rule and the dilemmas Antigone
   examines. This essay shows how today we still need Antigone in deepening
   our democracy and making better leadership decisions.},

Abstract = {Integrating Hobfoll's (1989) conservation of resources theory with
   Berry's (1997) acculturation taxonomies, we develop a typological theory
   to explain the acculturation stress and adaptation processes of domestic
   employees in the context of globalization. From a resource-based
   perspective, we first identify four resources-social dominance,
   ethnocentric orientation, social capital, and absorptive capacity-that
   represent Hobfoll's four kinds of resources (i.e., object, personal,
   condition, and energy) and differentiate them in terms of their goal
   (i.e., maintaining the original culture or seeking intercultural
   interactions) and orientation (i.e., individual or social). We postulate
   that domestic employees' loss and gain of these resources set boundary
   conditions for acculturation stress in response to the influence of
   globalization. Then, drawing on Berry's taxonomies, we configure
   different combinations of the loss and gain of these resources to form
   individual and collective ideal types of resources that set boundary
   conditions for the influence of acculturation stress on adaptation
   approaches (i.e., integration, assimilation, separation, and
   marginalization) at the individual level and the influence of
   globalization on adaptation cultures (i.e., multiculturalism, melting
   pot, segregation, and exclusion) at the organizational level. Finally,
   we propose that adaptation cultures exert influences on domestic
   employees' normative freedom of choice of adaptation approaches.},

Abstract = {We develop a theory of collective brand reputation for markets in which
   product quality is jointly determined by local and global players. In a
   repeated game of imperfect public monitoring, we model collective
   branding as an aggregation of quality signals generated in different
   markets. Such aggregation yields a beneficial informativeness effect for
   incentivizing the global player. It however also induces harmful
   free-riding by local, market-specific players. The resulting trade-off
   yields a theory of optimal brand size and revenue sharing that applies
   to platform markets, franchising, licensing, umbrella branding, and
   firms with team production.},

Title = {ORGANIZATIONAL UNDERDOG NARRATIVES: THE CULTIVATION AND CONSEQUENCES OF
   A COLLECTIVE UNDERDOG IDENTITY},
Journal = {ACADEMY OF MANAGEMENT REVIEW},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {48},
Number = {1},
Pages = {32-56},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Underdog stories--in which the disadvantaged and outmatched protagonist
   overcomes the odds-are ubiquitous. Leaders across industries, from
   telecom to sports, employ these narratives to inspire members of their
   organizations. However, little is understood about how underdog
   narratives influence the actions and attitudes of members of
   organizations. To address this gap, we explain how a leader's
   communication of an underdog narrative may instill confidence in members
   of the organization that together they can overcome their shared
   disadvantage and achieve a clear set of organizational aspirations. In
   doing so, we introduce a conceptual model that draws on the sensemaking
   and social identity literatures to explain how a leader's underdog
   narrative fosters the adoption of a collective underdog identity by
   members of an organization. Further, we explain that the specific
   attributes of the leader's underdog narrative influence how this unique
   type of collective identity leads to varied outcomes for members of an
   organization. As such, this paper aims to contribute to the
   understanding and utilization of a prevalent but underexamined
   organizational phenomenon.},

Abstract = {Teams often need to adapt to planned discontinuous task change or
   fundamental alteration of tasks, tools, and work systems. Although team
   adaptation theories have made substantive progress in explaining how
   teams can respond to change, they have not adequately considered the
   unique impact that discontinuous task change can have on teams. Such
   change can render not only collective but also individual task
   capabilities obsolete and necessitate a multilevel task relearning
   process. Drawing on the team compilation model, we suggest that
   adaptation to discontinuous task change is akin to team (re)development.
   We posit that teams are more effective when they approach discontinuous
   task change by first focusing on the rebuilding of individual task
   capabilities and only later shifting their attention to the rebuilding
   of team-level task capabilities. Moreover, we argue that the uncertainty
   caused by discontinuous task change makes reward fairness salient such
   that equity and equality in rewards are particularly useful in
   motivating members to (re)develop individual and collective task
   capabilities, respectively. We provide support for these arguments using
   survey, qualitative, and archival data from 115 manufacturing teams and
   discuss the implications of our findings for both research and practice.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF APPLIED PSYCHOLOGY},

Number = {2},
Pages = {225-248},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Asian employees occupy an intermediate status in the U.S. racial
   hierarchy between White and Black employees. Given this intermediate
   position, it is unclear whether and how Asian employees' own racial
   experience at work will affect their willingness to take action against
   racism toward other groups. In the current research, we examine how
   Asian employees' experiences of racism impact their propensity to combat
   racism against Black coworkers. Across four studies including a
   qualitative survey (Pilot), a time-lagged quantitative survey (Study 1),
   a preregistered experiment (Study 2), and a conceptual replication
   experiment (Study 3), we find that Asian employees who experience more
   racial discrimination at work feel more similar to Black individuals,
   which is subsequently associated with greater allyship toward Black
   coworkers. We find that this relationship is heightened among Asian
   employees who have stronger zero-sum beliefs (Study 1). Importantly, we
   further find that processes that lead to allyship among Asian employees
   differ among White employees (Studies 2-3): In contrast to Asian
   employees, White employees who perceive more anti-in-group workplace
   discrimination feel less similar to Black individuals, which is
   associated with diminished pro-Black allyship. By examining the poorly
   understood racial experiences of Asian employees, and uncovering
   mechanisms that propel Asian employees to engage in intergroup allyship,
   we provide a more complete picture of racism in the workplace.},

Abstract = {Questions about whether candidate perceptions of recruitment and
   selection practices ``matter{''} have been raised for decades. This
   study tackles such questions by developing a new theoretical framework
   to understand the business unit-level emergence and consequences of the
   collective candidate experience, defined as ``Applicants' aggregate
   overall cognitive and affective perceptions based on multiple
   interactions with a business unit over the course of the entire
   recruitment and selection process.{''} A theoretical framework is
   introduced that integrates signaling theory with research from
   marketing, recruitment, and applicant reactions to propose that the
   collective candidate experience construct emerges from interactions in
   unit-specific social, structural, and physical contexts. The construct
   is further expected to influence new hire outcomes and business unit
   outcomes. We then test the theorized consequences of the collective
   candidate experience in a multi-unit quick service restaurant
   organization. The collective candidate experience is positively
   associated with collective new hire engagement, which in turn is
   associated with collective new hire turnover intentions, collective
   turnover, and collective customer satisfaction. Additional supporting
   evidence and preliminary measures are provided in online appendices.
   Overall, this study complements and extends prior research and directs
   new research by offering a theoretical framework.},

Abstract = {In this study, we focus on the unintended consequences of new technology
   deployment for control-trust dynamics. When addressing these dynamics,
   managers and management researchers often focus on consciously designed
   and implemented controls and management actions that build, repair, or
   preserve trust. At the same time, unowned processes - processes that
   have no single source or purpose - easily go unnoticed. These processes
   may have effects that are inadvertent and sometimes detrimental. A
   close-up ethnographic study of a technology deployment provides insight
   into the emergence of unintended control practices and shifts in trust.
   Our findings demonstrate how deployment of new technology prompted a
   shift in the loci and forms of control and how trust, suspicion, and
   distrust surfaced asymmetrically as organizational members interpreted
   in different ways how others were using the new technological features.
   These developments contributed to the emergence of four unintended
   control practices: incidental monitoring, organizational surveillance,
   individual concealment, and collective resistance. Our study highlights
   the role of unowned processes in the control-trust dynamics and
   emphasizes that whether or not control and trust are consciously
   addressed, both play interactive and evolving roles in organizations.},

Abstract = {We study the susceptibility of committee governance (e.g. by boards of

   alternatives are voted on-agenda-manipulation. We exhibit an agenda
   strategy called insertion sort that allows a self-interested committee
   chair with no knowledge of how votes will be cast to do as well as if
   she had complete knowledge. Strategies with this ``regret-freeness{''}
   property are characterized by their efficiency, and by their avoidance
   of two intuitive errors. What distinguishes regret-free strategies from
   each other is how they prioritize among alternatives; insertion sort
   prioritizes lexicographically.},

Title = {Turning rebellion into money? Social entrepreneurship as the strategic

Volume = {17},

Abstract = {Research Summary: Critical scholars recognize a disjuncture between the
   problems identified by social entrepreneurs and the solutions they
   propose. Existing theory treats this as a problem to be rectified at the
   organizational level. In this essay, we widen attention to the
   macro-oriented systems change strategies of social entrepreneurs. We
   develop a dynamic typology showing how strategies are reassembled over
   time to stimulate or deflect desire for systems change. Deriving
   inspiration from Goffman, we theorize the ways that different types of
   systems change actor perform systems change via interaction with their
   environments. Drawing on illustrative cases on the boundaries of social
   entrepreneurship, we show how the collective action frameworks developed
   by systems change actors can be adapted and repurposed by their
   (systems) audiences: effectively turning rebellion into money.
   Managerial Summary: Social entrepreneurs often call for systems change
   to tackle wicked problems such as poverty or climate change. However,
   the strategies they propose for tackling these problems, such as lending
   money to poor people are considerably less radical. In this essay, we
   identify three types of systems change actor distinguished by the degree
   of systems change they call for. We trace their ideas over time to
   illustrate how strategies are mediated, and subsequently repurposed
   through interaction with the systems they seek to change. In conclusion,
   we call upon researchers and social entrepreneurs to widen their
   perspectives to incorporate more radical ideas and potentials for
   systems change, and for greater attention to be devoted to scrutinizing
   and protecting the integrity of systems change strategies.},

Abstract = {We investigated the role of heuristics in decision-making in infrequent
   and heterogeneous organizational processes. In our multiple-case study,
   we tracked individual managers' knowledge, how managers collectively
   articulated and codified knowledge, and how they used it in mergers and
   acquisitions (M\&A) decision-making. We developed a process model that
   explains (a) the evolution and the interplay between heuristics and
   causal knowledge and (b) the implications of these processes for
   decision-making. More precisely, we found that some managers possessed
   and used rough heuristics - heuristics developed via limited or
   non-existent firsthand experience. Because rough heuristics were often
   faulty, they led to errors if used in a different context. In contrast,
   other managers possessed and used causal knowledge - knowledge
   explaining causal regularities in the environment. Causal knowledge was
   associated with higher quality decision-making and better performance in
   subsequent acquisitions. The problem that our focal companies faced was
   that causal knowledge often evaporated during attempts at collective
   articulation and codification, causing the conversion of causal
   knowledge into rough heuristics. We contribute to the organizational
   heuristics literature by improving our understanding of the role of
   heuristics in infrequent and heterogeneous organizational processes. At
   a more general level, we contribute to the capabilities development
   literature by identifying three paths that capabilities development can
   take. We also offer important implications for managers.},

Abstract = {Serendipity - the notion of making surprising and valuable discoveries -
   plays a major role in the success of individuals and organizations
   alike. Previous research has established the importance of serendipity
   and identified important individual- and organizational-level
   antecedents. However, the literature has been dispersed and the
   boundaries of the concept have been blurry, leading to a lack of
   conceptual clarity and structure, and thus limiting validity and
   managerial actionability. Based on a systematic literature review, I
   synthesize existing management-related research on serendipity and
   explicate the emergence and composition of serendipity in the
   organizational context. I first identify three necessary conditions that
   differentiate serendipity from related concepts such as luck or targeted
   innovation: agency, surprise, and value. Then, I draw from the
   literature on sensemaking, event-based theorizing, and quantum-based
   approaches to management to conceptualize the process of cultivating
   serendipity in the organizational context as a process of enabling
   potentiality and materialization, and develop a multi-level theory of
   (cultivating) serendipity. This conceptualization contributes to our
   collective understanding of how, why, and when (i.e., under what
   conditions) organizations can leverage the value in the unexpected,
   which opens up fruitful avenues for further research.},

Abstract = {Research on clusters has highlighted that some geographical areas

   to specific locations???emerge away from their birthplace? We
   qualitatively investigate the influence that the town of Arco, Italy,
   and its periodic event ???RockMaster??? exerted on the emergence of the
   global sport climbing industry. We advance the concept of ???catalyzing
   places??? that support industry emergence and growth through an ongoing,
   cyclical process of three forces: ???centripetal??? (i.e., attracting),
   ???catalyzing??? (i.e., reacting), and ???centrifugal??? (i.e.,
   ejecting). The forces attract communi-ties of practice to the place,
   expose them to intense, transformational experiences toward
   entrepreneurship, and induce them to establish their businesses
   elsewhere. By redeploy-ing the resources and reputation acquired in the
   place, these scattered communities enact a collective phenomenon of user
   entrepreneurship and ultimately industry emer-gence. We claim that the
   ongoing activities of the place, and the periodic ones of the event, are
   mutually reinforcing. We advance two novel elements??????portable
   economies??? and ???springboard firms??????that, in catalyzing places,
   exert the antithetical effect of ???agglomeration economies??? and
   ???anchor firms??? in clusters. We discuss our contribution to research
   on industry emergence, new practices, and user entrepreneurship.},

Title = {Entrepreneurial Ecosystems as Amplifiers of the Lean Startup Philosophy:
   Management Control Practices in Earliest-Stage Startups},
Journal = {CONTEMPORARY ACCOUNTING RESEARCH},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {40},

Abstract = {Entrepreneurial ecosystems play a key role in the development of
   startups not only by providing support-such as flexible office space and
   access to skilled employees, mentors, and investors-but moreover by
   promoting concrete ideals about ``good{''} entrepreneurship. However, we
   know less about the role that ecosystems play in managerial practices of
   startups. In our empirical analysis of management control systems (MCSs)
   in earliest-stage startups, we witness a strong influence of
   entrepreneurial ideals-above all, the Lean Startup philosophy-on the
   MCSs analyzed. Building on cross-sectional field study data resulting
   from a comprehensive field-immersion strategy and 50 interviews with key
   actors in an entrepreneurial ecosystem as well as with founder-managers
   of startups, we consider the entrepreneurial ecosystem as a collective
   meso-level community that mediates between macro-level institutional
   pressures and micro-level practices of startups. We show how this
   community, through a variety of what we term amplifying mechanisms,
   actively deinstitutionalizes a legacy entrepreneurial philosophy
   epitomized by the business plan concept. At the same time, the community
   propagates the Lean Startup philosophy so that this alternative has
   become the dominant institutional philosophy in the studied ecosystem
   and its startups. Due to the amplifying mechanisms exerted by the meso
   level, startups use MCSs that play a crucial role in the rapid
   experimentation and learning process toward finding a scalable business
   model that is characteristic of the Lean Startup philosophy. We
   highlight that this philosophy of scientific experimentation has, to a
   significant degree, transformed intuitive entrepreneurial processes into
   a set of transactions that can be steered and accelerated by MCSs.},

Title = {THE INFLUENCE OF STATUS ON EVALUATIONS: EVIDENCE FROM ONLINE CODING
   CONTESTS},

Abstract = {In many instances, online contest platforms rely on contestants to
   ensure submission quality. This scalable evaluation mechanism offers a
   collective benefit. However, contestants may also leverage it to achieve
   personal, competitive benefits. Our study examines this tension from a
   status-theoretic perspective, suggesting that the conflict between
   competitive and collective benefits, and the net implication for
   evaluation efficacy, is influenced by contestants' status. On the one
   hand, contestants of lower status may be viewed as less skilled and
   hence more likely to make mistakes. Therefore, low-status contestants
   may attract more evaluations if said evaluations are driven
   predominantly by an interest in collective benefits. On the other hand,
   if evaluations are driven largely by an interest in personal,
   competitive benefits, a low-status contestant makes for a less
   attractive target and hence may attract fewer evaluations. We
   empirically test these competing possibilities using a dataset of coding
   contests from Codeforces. The platform allows contestants to assess
   others' submissions and improve evaluations (a collective benefit) by
   devising test cases (hacks) in addition to those defined by the contest
   organizer. If a submission is successfully hacked, the hacker earns
   additional points, and the target submission is eliminated from the
   contest (a competitive benefit). We begin by providing qualitative
   evidence based on semi-structured interviews conducted with contestants
   spanning the status spectrum at Codeforces. Next, we present
   quantitative evidence exploiting a structural change at Codeforces
   wherein many contestants experienced an arbitrary status reduction
   unrelated to their performance because of sudden changes to the
   platform's color-coding system around contestant ratings. We show that
   status-loser contestants received systematically more evaluations from
   other contestants, absent changes in their short-run submission quality.
   Finally, we show that the excess evaluations allocated toward affected
   contestants were less effective, indicating status-driven evaluations as
   potentially less efficacious. We discuss the implications of our
   findings for managing evaluation processes in online contests.},

Abstract = {How do senior managers of social mission-driven organizations build and
   sustain stakeholders??? emotional resonance with organizational identity
   beliefs over time in the face of repeated existential threats? This is
   an important question, given the dependence of many such organizations
   on external stakeholders who provide the resources necessary for
   survival. In this paper, we investigate the case of Solidum, a
   philanthropic organization devoted to poverty causes. Drawing on
   ethnographic, interview, and archival data over 20 years, we develop a
   process model showing how senior managers may create and sustain
   stakeholder emotional resonance through three practices of emotional
   resonance work: (a) building emotional bridges, (b) enrolling
   stakeholders in collective soulsearching, and (c) materializing an
   appealing identity symbol. We show that stakeholder emotional resonance
   needs to be continually renewed and reshaped in the face of ongoing
   challenges associated with macro-organizational trends and the
   routinization of existing practices that can result in the dissipation
   of emotional resonance over time. The paper contributes to the
   literature on organizational identity maintenance by drawing attention
   to the active managerial work required to sustain stakeholder emotional
   resonance over time to allow mission-driven organizations to survive and
   prosper.},

Abstract = {Rural-urban healthcare access inequality refers to a disparity between
   rural and urban people with severe medical ailments in gaining access to
   the high-quality healthcare services they need. Although much hope has
   been pinned on the use of health information technology (HIT) to
   alleviate this critical and enduring societal challenge, the realized
   societal impact of HIT is unclear. Anchoring on both social
   transformation theory and affordance actualization theory, we conducted
   an in-depth qualitative study with two rounds of data collection in
   China. In addition to investigating how the societal challenge has
   triggered transformative HIT interventions, our analysis contributes to
   a theory on an HIT solution for the rural-urban healthcare access
   inequality challenge by establishing a link between HIT affordances and
   HIT interventions. This is done by examining how microlevel HIT effects
   escalate to macrolevel HIT effects through societal-level affordance
   actualization, which can affect this healthcare access inequality
   challenge. Along with providing policy implications on introducing HIT
   solutions to address intricate and complex societal challenges, this
   study extends existing theories by revealing the adaptation of the HIT
   intervention and differentiating the effects of collective and shared
   affordances.},

Abstract = {Research Summary: Research suggests that multinational enterprises
   (MNEs) are attracted to locations with concentrated firms from the same
   home country to benefit from interactions with market forces, but it
   remains an open question whether such agglomeration facilitates MNEs'
   interactions with nonmarket actors such as the host government. We
   submit that since country-of-origin agglomeration can enable collective
   actions and create collective gains, colocation with compatriot firms
   will help MNEs navigate an adverse institutional environment. In line
   with this reasoning, we hypothesize that MNEs are more attracted to
   locations with country-of-origin agglomeration when MNEs face an
   exogenous shock that increases their regulatory burden in the host
   country. Our analysis offers corroborative evidence. The study adds to
   research on agglomeration, institutional environment, and location
   strategy. Managerial Summary: Why do multinational enterprises (MNEs)
   locate near compatriot firms in a foreign location? The commonly
   recognized benefits include resource access and knowledge spillover from
   interactions with market forces such as suppliers and customers. We
   submit that colocation with compatriot firms can also help MNEs navigate
   an adverse institutional environment by generating ``stronger-together
   `` benefits. Colocation can enable collective actions and create
   collective gains for MNEs in their interactions with the host
   government. We find that after a diplomatic dispute, Korean MNEs are
   more attracted to locations in China that already have a cluster of
   Korean firms, whether in the same/related industries or in unrelated
   industries; this is particularly the case for small MNEs and in
   locations with weak institutions.},

Abstract = {Trade credit is an important source of short-term financing and an
   integrated part in supply contracts. Although a number of theories have
   been proposed on how trade credit could improve supply chain efficiency,
   causal studies on the impact of trade credit on operational decisions
   are scarce. In this study, we examine the impact of trade credit on
   inventory decisions using an empirical strategy that leverages (i) an
   exogenous shock imparted by the French government's intervention to
   impose a ceiling on trade credit duration, (ii) a triple
   difference-in-differences identification strategy, and (iii) synthetic
   controls (SCs). By considering the 60-day ceiling coverage and SC
   construction requirements, we identify four French retail sectors as our
   main sample. Among them, in the postregulation period, the hardware
   retail sector firms on average exhibited a significant 16\% decline in
   trade credit usage. Correspondingly, these firms also displayed a
   significant 11\% decline in inventory level. In the remaining three
   sectors, we found mixed results in the main sample. All the four
   sectors, however, show consistent support for a causal link between
   trade credit and inventory in a subsample compiled using a stringent
   90-day ceiling criterion. Collectively, our findings offer direct
   evidence that trade credit is an indispensable financing source for
   inventory procurement. Finally, in the postregulation period, the
   hardware retailers exhibited a 15.5\% decline in revenue and 3.5\%
   reduction in gross profit. This cautions policy makers that regulations
   limiting the use of trade credit may have unintended consequences on
   downstream firms, and may harm overall supply chain efficiency.},

Journal = {ORGANIZATION STUDIES},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {44},
Number = {2},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Our paper investigates the dynamic interplay of narratives of individual
   and collective leadership within a professional service firm, where an
   organizational narrative of collective leadership prevails. We explain
   how it is possible for `everyone' to claim a leadership identity for
   themselves while simultaneously granting a leadership identity to the
   collective. We identify multiple leadership archetypes embedded in
   individuals' identity narratives, representing their differing senses of
   themselves as leaders and their alignment with the organizational
   narrative of collective leadership. These archetypes are mutually
   constitutive, representing centripetal and centrifugal tendencies in
   relation to the organizational narrative of collective leadership. We
   show how individuals committed to collective leadership nevertheless
   construct an individual leader (the Avatar identity archetype) to embody
   the collective on their behalf, and this enables them to grant
   leadership to the collective in the abstract. We emphasize the
   persistent sacralization of leadership in individual and organizational
   narratives, even in avowedly collectivist contexts, and the value of
   narrative-based perspectives in highlighting practitioners' ability to
   navigate and accommodate the messy coexistence of collective and
   individual leadership. Our study shows the importance of integrating
   dialectically the individual and collective dimensions of leadership,
   emphasizing the mutually constitutive nature of individual and
   collective leadership narratives.},

Abstract = {This paper employs a strong process approach to leadership - one that
   focuses on leadership moments in action - to explore how collaborative
   leadership emerges within a hierarchical context. Drawing on observation
   in three haute cuisine restaurant kitchen brigades - highly hierarchical
   teams that deal with intense time pressures - we document empirically in
   the ongoing flow of experience how leadership moments reorient
   collective action as a response to an unstable environment. Moreover, we
   show how collaborative leadership emerges from a hierarchical structure,
   counterintuitively, during the most critical period of the service. Our
   contribution is twofold. We offer a novel conceptualization of the
   emergence of plural leadership within a hierarchical context, one that
   highlights the capacity to reframe the way of working together during
   the most critical moments of an unfolding situation. In addition, our
   work contributes to the strong process approach to leadership through
   the methodology adopted: rather than exploring how turning points are
   discursively enacted, we focus on these as manifested in action and in
   the non-verbal aspects displayed at such moments.},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {In this commentary, we engage with the study by Carney, El Ghoul,
   Guedhami, Lu and Wang, titled ``Political corporate social
   responsibility: The role of deliberative capacity.'' Their study
   provides empirical support for earlier claims that deliberative capacity
   - the capacity of political institutions to enable diverse stakeholders
   to collectively assemble and voice their opinions - is an important
   building block to understanding the prominence or lack thereof of
   corporate social responsibility (CSR) in a country. In so doing, Carney
   and co-authors contribute to the so-called ``Political CSR'' or PCSR
   literature. Yet, their study carries two important shortcomings that can
   be addressed to bring PCSR research forward in an IB context. First,
   they ignore a fundamental tenet of the PCSR literature, namely the
   existence of global governance gaps requiring private businesses to
   actively engage in political activity. Second, and related to the first,
   their model and associated variables are misspecified, with independent
   and dependent variables that are at least partially overlapping.
   Departing from these shortcomings, we attempt to engage constructively
   with their work in the interest of advancing the conversation in IB
   about private sector involvement in democratic will formation to achieve
   social and environmental responsibility.},

Abstract = {Many firms in developing countries could be too small to adopt modern
   technology embodied in expensive production machines. This paper shows
   that rental market interactions allow these small firms to increase
   their effective scale and mechanize production. We conduct a survey of
   manufacturing firms in Uganda, which uncovers an active rental market
   for large machines between small firms in informal clusters. We then
   build an equilibrium model of firm behavior and estimate it with our
   data. We find that the rental market is quantitatively important for
   mechanization and productivity since it provides a workaround for other
   market imperfections that keep firms small. The rental market also
   shapes the effectiveness of development policies to foster
   mechanization, such as subsidies to purchase machines. Overall, our
   results point to the importance of taking into account firm-to-firm
   interactions within informal clusters to understand technology adoption
   in low income countries: focusing on the small scale of firms in
   isolation might be misleading.},

Pages = {37-55},

Abstract = {In ways accentuated by the global coronavirus pandemic, corporations
   constitute vital instruments of the acts of beneficence needed by the
   people of the world to make progress in public health and increase
   collective and individual well-being. This article contributes to
   understanding the variety of moral forces that may lead corporations to
   commit acts of beneficence, including Friedman's business case for
   corporate beneficence, the duty of beneficence as developed by business
   ethicists, and Dunfee's social contract account of corporate obligation.
   Whereas Mejia recently contributed to scholarship on corporate
   beneficence by expressly adopting shareholder primacy's conception of
   corporate governance, this article embraces a stakeholder-oriented,
   managerialist picture of corporate governance. I extend the literature
   on beneficence by incorporating what I argue is the intuition underlying
   Dunfee's contractualist formula of minimal contribution, namely that
   management's duty to do good is awakened and unshackled to the extent
   management judges the corporation can afford to commit acts of
   beneficence, all stakeholders considered. The
   all-stakeholders-considered case for corporate beneficence compels
   management to act, I argue, when inaction would undermine the moral
   integrity of managers personally committed to promoting the well-being
   of humanity.},

Abstract = {Many business ethicists, activists, analysts, and corporate leaders
   claim that businesses are obligated to promote diversity for the sake of
   justice. Many also say-good news!-that diversity promotes the bottom
   line. We do need not choose between social justice and profits. This
   paper splashes some cold water on the attempt to mate these two claims.
   On the contrary, I argue, there is philosophical tension between
   arguments which say diversity is a matter of justice and (empirically
   sound) arguments which say diversity promotes performance. Further, the
   kinds of interventions these distinct arguments suggest are different.
   Things get worse when we examine the theory and empirical evidence about
   how diversity affects group performance. The kind of diversity which
   promotes justice and the kind which promotes the bottom line are
   distinct-and the two can be at odds.},

Abstract = {Using a unique panel data set of manufacturing rms in Spain in
   1994-2006, I show that the use of exible (shorter and cheaper-to-re)
   employment contracts promotes debt nancing. I build the identication
   strategy on the intertemporal, cross-regional, and cross-gender
   variation in government subsidies that differentially encouraged rms to
   hire workers on the less exible contracts. A thought experiment of
   prohibiting an average rm from hiring workers on exible contracts
   suggests that such a rm should reduce its debt to-capital ratio by 7\%.
   These ndings suggest that exible employment contracts reduce operating
   leverage and the xity of rms' costs, increasing nancial leverage. The
   unique institutional environment allows me to isolate this mechanism
   from collective bargaining and total labor cost channels. I further show
   that employment exibility increases rm performance for rms that benet
   most from operating leverage reductions and depend more on external
   nancing. The results demonstrate how management can use heterogenous
   labor contracts to improve rm outcomes.},

Title = {The Agency to Implement Voice: How Target Hierarchical Position and
   Competence Changes the Relationship Between Voice and Individual
   Performance},
Journal = {ORGANIZATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {34},
Number = {5},
Month = {SEP-OCT},
Abstract = {Although voice is communication that is intended to benefit the
   performance of collectives, little is known about the benefits or costs
   to individual task performance and what mechanisms drive these effects.
   Our research offers new theory to articulate and illustrate the
   conditions under which voice has positive versus negative effects on
   individual task performance by directly acknowledging that employees
   have many options for where to direct their ideas. We introduce an
   agency perspective on voice by theorizing that one fundamental reason
   why employees speak up is to generate the implementation of corrective
   action for issues affecting themselves and to the extent targets of
   voice have agency to facilitate action through implementation of voice,
   voicing employees should be more likely to realize performance benefits
   from speaking up. In a first field study, we present evidence that two
   characteristics-the hierarchical position of the voice target (boss
   versus peer) and the competence of the voice target-alter the
   relationship between voice and the voicing employee's task performance.
   In a second field study, using an event-contingent design, we provide
   evidence of the unique mechanisms underlying how competent managers (via
   their resources) and competent peers (via their efficacy to act) affect
   how upward and sideways voices lead to idea implementation. We discuss
   the theoretical implications of these ideas and findings by highlighting
   how voice target characteristics influence not just the incidence of
   voice but also, its outcomes.},

Abstract = {The enormous scale of suffering, breadth of societal impact, and ongoing
   uncertainty wrought by the COVID-19 pandemic introduced dynamics seldom
   examined in the crisis entrepreneurship literature. Previous research
   indicates that when a crisis causes a failure of public goods,
   spontaneous citizen ventures often emerge to leverage unique local
   knowledge to rapidly customize abundant external resources to meet
   immediate needs. However, as outsiders, emergent citizen groups
   responding to the dire shortage of personal protective equipment at the
   onset of COVID-19 lacked local knowledge and legitimacy. In this study,
   we examine how entrepreneurial citizens mobilized collective resources
   in attempts to gain acceptance and meet local needs amid the urgency of
   the pandemic. Through longitudinal case studies of citizen groups
   connected to makerspaces in four U.S. cities, we study how they adapted
   to address the resource and legitimacy limitations they encountered. We
   identify three mechanisms-augmenting, circumventing, and
   attenuating-that helped transient citizen groups calibrate their
   resource mobilization based on what they learned over time. We highlight
   how extreme temporality imposes limits on resourcefulness and
   legitimation, making it critical for collective entrepreneurs to learn
   when to work within their limitations rather than try to overcome them.},

Abstract = {Companies adopt various HRM practices to enhance employees' abilities,
   motivations, and opportunities to foster innovation. Are these practices
   universally effective or culturally contingent? In this study, we draw
   on the Ability-Motivation-Opportunity (AMO) model and examine the
   effectiveness of three representative practices using a dataset of 304
   companies from 13 countries or regions. We find that HRM practices need
   to fit in a supplementary/complementary way with national cultures to
   facilitate firm innovation: 1. cross-functional training (i.e., an
   ability-enhancing practice) is more effective in collectivistic rather
   than individualistic cultures (supplementary fit); 2. financial rewards
   for innovation (i.e., a motivation-enhancing practice) are more
   effective in masculine rather than feminine cultures (supplementary
   fit); and 3. employee participation (i.e., an opportunity-enhancing
   practice) is more effective in high rather than low power distance
   cultures (complementary fit). By building on the notion of
   supplementary/complementary fit, these findings extend our knowledge of
   the AMO model in the context of HRM and innovation management with a
   cultural contingency perspective.},

Abstract = {In this paper, I examine how an organization narratively constructs its
   prototypical disabled employee. Data comprise public narratives of the
   Government of India, the country's largest employer of disabled persons.
   Narratives during 2008-2016 were considered as this timespan witnessed
   the design of inclusive legislation that emphasized defining disabled
   persons and their entitlements. Findings indicate that the label of
   ``disadvantage{''} was consistently used to portray the target employee.
   Alongside other narrative material suggesting, for example that the
   target employee was someone who required employment assistance, this
   label was supplied to external audiences to convert them into potential
   partners. This supply of narrative material further reinforced the
   portrayal of the target employee. Consistent use of this expansive label
   subsumed changing definitions of who is a disabled person, allowed for
   aggregations with diverse disadvantaged collectives, and accommodated
   changes in employment entitlements and ecosystem partners, thereby
   allowing the reading of change in stable narratives. The contributions
   of this paper lie in highlighting how the consistent use of an expansive
   label can cast narrative stability and change as complementary, and in
   suggesting that narrating a prototypical employee entails shaping the
   setting outside the employing organization toward employee
   categorization.},

Abstract = {In this essay, we review and discuss potential changes to dominant
   governance approaches that may help business leaders play a more active

   political philosophy to unlock businesses' ability to enhance the
   long-term sustainability of the communities where they operate.
   Collectively, the reviewed books point to the importance of moving
   corporate governance approaches from their current dominance on
   shareholders' interests to a greater emphasis on more collaborative
   arrangements that integrate a broader set of stakeholders' interests in
   a manner that accounts for the financial as well as social and
   environmental implications of corporate action. It is not our intention
   to engage in a philosophical discussion of these works, but rather to
   obtain relevant insights from a related discipline that can help us add
   novel ideas to existing corporate governance debates.},

Abstract = {Any single competition is rarely a ``one-off{''} event and instead is
   often part of a larger sequence of related competitions. Thus, we
   contend that in order to better understand people's competitive
   experiences, we must take a more holistic view, where their experiences
   and behaviors in the present are a function of their past and expected
   future outcomes. This research expands the temporal lens of competition
   by examining how past outcomes (i.e., winning vs. losing streak) and
   future expectations (i.e., underdog vs. favorite standing) collectively
   influence an actor's cognitive and affective reactions to a competition,
   with implications for their willingness to transgress. Studies 1
   (fantasy football managers) and 2 (the English Premiere League teams)
   show that streaks and underdog vs. favorite standing interact to predict
   competitive transgressions: winning streaks increase transgressions for
   underdogs, and losing streaks increase transgressions for favorites.
   Studies 3 (public defenders) and 4 (Democrats and Republicans)
   experimentally manipulate streaks and standing and unpack the cognitive
   (i.e., outcome uncertainty) and affective (i.e., excitement for
   underdogs, and anxiety for favorites) mechanisms that precipitate these
   transgressions. Theoretical implications for the competition literature,
   as well as managerial insights, are discussed.},

Abstract = {This paper studies , theoretically and experimentally , the effects of
   overconfidence and fake news on information aggregation and the quality
   of democratic choice in a common-interest setting. We theo-retically
   show that overconfidence exacerbates the adverse effects of widespread
   misinformation (i.e. , fake news). We then analyze richer models that
   allow for partisanship , targeted misinformation intended to sway public
   opinion , and news signals correlated across voters (due to media
   ownership concentration or censorship). In our exper-iment ,
   overconfidence severely undermines information aggregation , suggesting
   that the effect of overconfidence can be much more pro-nounced at the
   collective than at the individual level. (JEL C91, D12, D72, D82, D83,

Abstract = {Over the past decade, paradox theory has developed impressively. Such
   advances have been fueled by a rising collective experience of
   paradox-as change, scarcity and plurality intensify awareness of
   conflicting, interdependent and persistent forces-and by a global
   community of paradox scholars-notably creative, dedicated and mutually
   supportive. We are honored by the 2021 Decade Award. Our 2011
   publication helped shape rigorous research while informing vexing
   challenges. In this manuscript, we reflect on factors contributing to
   this scholarly expansion, offering insights into how advances of paradox
   theory could generalize to the rise of fields more broadly. We then
   explore the accumulation of paradox scholarship, noting the convergence
   of key ideas and definitions, while recognizing the divergence of
   ontologies, methodologies, theories, and phenomena. Building upon
   expanding insights into how to navigate paradox, we categorize varied
   approaches into four sets of tools-assumptions (cognition), boundaries
   (structures), comfort (emotions), and dynamics (change)-presented within
   an integrative framework that we label the Paradox System. By doing so,
   we highlight the breadth of underlying research, depict interwoven and
   paradoxical relationships across categories, and surface a core insight
   that navigating paradox is paradoxical. Finally, we offer suggestions
   and provocations for future research.},

Abstract = {This article critically interrogates the meaning of freedom and its
   current and potential relationship with social relations in and around
   work as introduction to this special issue. This interrogation is vital
   given neoliberalism's evaluative promise for more individual and
   corporate freedom, while concurrently limiting the conditions for the
   experience/expression of freedom of workers. Consequently, there are
   concerns about working for ``private governments{''}, workers being
   subject to electronic surveillance, and workers increasingly caught up
   in structural disadvantages (i.e. precarious work) that contribute to
   growing unfreedom. Rather than reproducing abstract principles around
   freedom, this article and special issue advance a contextually sensitive
   emergence of freedom. We explicate this emergence as (i) alternative
   experiences of freedom, (ii) alternative conceptions of freedom, and
   (iii) alternative modes of organizing. To inspire future research, we
   extend these themes to suggest that treating freedom (i) as
   pluralist/relational and (ii) as having the capacity for world-making
   has meaningful implications for how work is organized and for whose
   benefit. We advocate an explicit turn to non-neoliberal values (e.g.
   collectivism, solidarity, human dignity, respect, and recognition) to
   enable more relational versions of freedom that can serve as a basis for
   freedom as world-making at work and in society.},

Abstract = {Rhetorical history has emerged as a useful theoretical construct that
   bridges the long recognized gap between historical and organizational
   scholarship. Despite its growing popularity, the precise nature of
   rhetorical history as a construct, its scope conditions, and its utility
   in resolving critical issues in historical organizational analysis
   remains unclear. This paper addresses these issues. We define rhetorical
   history and contextualize the construct by elaborating its relationship
   to associated concepts like collective memory, rhetoric, and narrative.
   We ground the construct by reviewing literature that has applied
   rhetorical history in both theory and empirical research. Our inductive
   review identifies four recurring themes in which rhetorical history is
   used to construct perceptions of; (a) continuity and discontinuity, (b)
   similarity and difference, (c) winners and losers, and (d) morality and
   immorality. We conclude with a discussion of how rhetorical history is
   an essential mechanism of institutional work.},

Title = {The Negative Effect of Low Belonging on Consumer Responses to
   Sustainable Products},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ETHICS},

Volume = {187},
Number = {3},
Pages = {473-492},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Sustainable products are engineered to reduce environmental, ecological,
   and human costs of consumption. Not all consumers value sustainable
   products, however, and this poses negative societal implications. Using
   self-expansion theory as a guide, we explore how an individual's general
   sense of belonging-or the perception that one is accepted and valued by
   others in the broader social world-alters their responses to sustainable
   products. Five experimental studies and a field study demonstrate that
   individuals lower in belonging respond less favorably to sustainable
   products in terms of evaluations and willingness to pay than individuals
   higher in belonging. Process evidence shows that the extent to which
   individuals low in belonging perceive that collective, sustainable
   choices will impact them personally drives this result and that
   belonging does not impact responses to conventional (i.e.,
   non-sustainable) products. However, perceiving a shared human
   experience-or that individuals share some important, basic similarities
   with all people-attenuates the negative effect of low belonging on
   responses to sustainable products for consumers both low and high in
   belonging. This research has significant implications for businesses and
   society given the growing sense of disconnect in modern society.},

Abstract = {Natural disaster events such as drought affect the broader economy and
   inflict adverse consequences for firms because of spill-over effects in
   an integrated economy. Contrary to the expectation that firms would
   engage in higher levels of corporate tax avoidance strategies when they

   that firms engage in less corporate tax avoidance when their headquarter
   states experience drought. Reduced tax avoidance is more pronounced
   among firms with higher CSR performance and among firms operating in
   states that experience a GDP decline. Collectively, the findings of our
   study demonstrate prosocial and ethical behavior of U.S. firms when they

Title = {Cultural congruence or compensation? A meta-analytic test of

Journal = {JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS STUDIES},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {54},
Number = {3},
Pages = {476-504},

Abstract = {Prior research is equivocal about whether leadership is more effective
   when it matches typical cultural practices (the cultural congruence
   argument) or compensates for ``ineffective{''} cultural practices (the
   cultural compensation argument). We propose that a more nuanced answer
   to the congruence-versus-compensation debate requires the joint
   consideration of leadership, culture, and task contexts. A meta-analysis
   of 460 field samples of transformational leadership (N = 124,646) and
   139 field samples of transactional leadership (N = 38,327) across 53
   cultures revealed three key results: First, both transformational and
   transactional leadership universally relate positively to follower
   performance outcomes. The strength of these relationships ranges between
   0.25 and 0.39 for transformational leadership and between 0.12 and 0.24
   for transactional leadership. Second, the positive effects of
   transformational leadership on convergent performance outcomes are more
   pronounced in cultures characterized by norms of vertical
   differentiation (including high power distance) and harmony (including
   collectivism), consistent with the cultural congruence perspective.
   Third, the positive effects of transactional leadership on divergent
   performance outcomes are more pronounced in cultures characterized by
   norms of low performance-focus (including low uncertainty avoidance),
   consistent with the cultural compensation perspective. We discuss the
   implications of these findings for transformational and transactional
   leadership research and practice.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {50},
Number = {2},
Pages = {556-587},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Our research extends past envy research by considering how envy and
   gender congruence shape interpersonal dynamics at the dyadic level and
   their bottom-up effects for team performance. Integrating social
   comparison theory and social identity theory, we examine when and how
   dyadic level envy influences team performance. Using time-lagged data
   from 428 dyads of 161 employees in 51 teams, our results show that
   envious employees are likely to engage in interpersonal deviance
   directed toward envied team members and that envied employees are likely
   to seek advice from envious team members. Gender congruence further
   influences these relationships, with different patterns for males and
   females. Specifically, while envious male employees are more likely to
   engage in interpersonal deviance toward envied male team members (i.e.,
   male-male dyads), envied female team members are more likely to ask
   envious female employees for advice (i.e., female-female dyads).
   Interpersonal dynamics involving envy have performance implications,
   such that team performance is worse where envious employees are more
   likely to engage in interpersonal deviance directed toward envied team
   members, in comparison to teams where this relationship is weaker.
   Finally, collective team identification mitigates the negative effect of
   envious employees' interpersonal deviance on team performance.},

Title = {A Matter of When, Not Whether: A Meta-Analysis of Modesty Bias in East
   Asian Self-Ratings of Job Performance},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF APPLIED PSYCHOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {108},
Number = {2},
Pages = {291-306},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Much attention has been paid to the question of whether there is a
   modesty bias in East Asian employees' self-ratings of job performance
   (i.e., a tendency to self-rate their performance lower than supervisors
   rate it). However, empirical results are conflicting, with some studies
   supporting the modesty bias and others not supporting it. We suggest
   that moderators representing boundary conditions for the modesty bias
   effect may shed light on these conflicting results. In essence, the
   question should not be ``whether there is a modesty bias,{''} but rather
   ``when is there a modesty bias?{''} We propose three moderators: purpose
   of the ratings (administrative, developmental, or research), job
   performance dimension (task performance, organizational citizenship
   behavior, or leadership), and country-level in-group collectivism. Based
   on 40 studies (63 independent samples) with samples from East Asia
   (mainland China, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan), we found no evidence
   of a modesty bias. That is, East Asian employees' self-ratings were, on
   average, higher than supervisor-ratings of job performance (i.e., a
   leniency bias). The one exception was when ratings were collected for
   research purposes; in this case, there was, on average, no mean
   difference between self- and supervisor-ratings. Thus, East Asian
   employees' research-purpose self-ratings are more modest, but this does
   not cross into a ``modesty bias.{''} In all, our results do not support
   a modesty bias as a widespread cultural norm among East Asian employees.},

Number = {4},

Abstract = {Although research has examined the role of disability in the employment
   cycle, the compensation stage of this process has remained nascent.
   Drawing on the bias literature and expectancy violation theory,
   disability within the context of salary negotiation is examined across
   three consecutive studies. Study 1, a vignette experiment, found that
   fictitious job candidates with disabilities received similar initial
   salary offerings relative to fictitious job candidates without
   disabilities. Our finding of a pay similarity in the initial salary
   offering phase of the compensation process raises additional questions
   of whether those with disabilities ultimately receive lower wages than
   those without disabilities. To address this question, Study 2 used a
   computer-simulated negotiation to determine if pay differences among
   those with and without disabilities originate during the negotiation
   process. As expected, participants with disabilities negotiated lower
   salaries, and this effect was exacerbated when perceptions of disability
   discrimination were higher rather than lower. Finally, in an effort to
   better advise organizations and employees, Study 3 sought to understand
   if employees with disabilities experience different outcomes when
   negotiating salary. Using a vignette experimental design, we found that
   those with disabilities were offered lower final salaries than those
   without disabilities and that differences in both social and economic
   outcomes occur through a lower perceived likelihood that the job
   candidate will negotiate. Collectively, this research offers novel
   theoretical insights into the role of disability in the negotiation
   process and provides recommendations to those with disabilities and
   organizations on how to approach the compensation process.},

Abstract = {There are considerable language barriers facing the potential collective
   labour organization of multi-ethnic migrant workers. From the research
   literature, we know little about linguistic practices that might
   overcome these barriers. Based on an ethnographic study of the
   participatory organizing of S.I. Cobas multi-ethnic migrant workers in
   the Italian logistics sector, we point to three linguistic practices
   that help overcome language barriers - translation, lingua franca and
   humour. We theorize these three linguistic practices as constituting an
   `improvised language of solidarity'. We argue that an improvised
   language of solidarity develops from, and can significantly support,
   participatory organizing.},

Abstract = {Drawing on the notion of compensatory behavior, this paper studies how
   students compensate for learning loss during a pandemic and what role
   artificial intelligence (AI) plays in this regard. We further probe into
   a difference in compensatory behavior for learning loss in terms of
   quantity, pattern, and pace (i.e., tripartite aspect of learning
   behavior) of AI-powered learning app usage depending on the level of
   pandemic threat and the proximity of a goal to students. Results show
   that the pandemic threat affects student learning behavior differently.
   Immediately following the COVID-19 outbreak, students who live in the
   epicenter of the outbreak (versus those who do not) use the app less at
   first, but with time, they use it more (quantity), on a more regular
   basis (pattern), and rebound to a curriculum path (pace) comparable to
   students who do not live in the outbreak's epicenter. These findings
   collectively explain behavior that is consistent with compensation for
   learning loss. The results also partially corroborate the goal-proximity
   effect, revealing that proximity to a goal (e.g., the degree to which
   the national university admission exam is approaching) has a moderating
   role in explaining the tripartite perspective of student learning
   behavior. Overall, these findings have important theoretical and
   practical implications for understanding how innovative education
   technologies can not only facilitate student learning during adversity,
   but also support learning recovery after adversity.},

Title = {Love at first insight: An attachment perspective on early-phase idea
   selection},
Journal = {ORGANIZATIONAL BEHAVIOR AND HUMAN DECISION PROCESSES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {172},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Creativity depends on individuals' willingness to invest in their novel
   ideas early in the creative process. Bur-geoning research on idea
   evaluation suggests that while people can identify their novel ideas,
   they may reject them because they are risky and uncertain. Selecting
   novel ideas is crucial at the earliest phase of the creative process, in
   which individuals may evaluate several generated ideas to identify those
   they want to develop and share with others. To uncover when and why
   people select these ideas, we develop and test theory on the early
   -stage selection of novel ideas. Integrating theory from attachment,
   self-construal, and creativity we posit that creators can become
   attached to, and therefore select their early-stage novel ideas when the
   idea features affirm core aspects of their self. Individuals with an
   independent self-construal wish to affirm their unique identity and
   idiosyncratic agenda and thus are more likely to feel attached to, and
   select their novel ideas. In contrast, in-dividuals with an
   interdependent self-construal are less likely to become attached to
   novel ideas, because these ideas do not validate their self. Findings
   from a field study on three early-stage hackathons and three experiments
   support our theory. Our research points to idea attachment as a new
   mechanism that explains when and why creators embrace early-stage novel
   ideas.},

Year = {2022},

Abstract = {We document that a significant number of insiders violate the Securities
   and Exchange Commission (SEC) reporting requirements by filing open
   market transactions after the legally required deadline. Prior to the
   Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX), 29\% of transactions fell outside the required
   reporting window. Following SOX, 8\% are delinquent. Violations cluster
   in periods of high information asymmetry, incentivizing insiders to keep
   trades private and earn abnormal returns. Collectively, these findings
   suggest that a subgroup of insiders personally benefit from violating
   SEC disclosure requirements. Evidence also suggests that blockholders
   provide governance for violations. Guilty insiders experience a
   reduction in board seats and an increased likelihood of turnover.},

Abstract = {Collective workplaces - such as coworking spaces, open workplan offices,
   maker spaces, or fab labs - are founded on one central premise: working
   alongside others leads to interactions, collaborations and access to
   `buzzing' knowledge. Yet, at the same time, users of these places go
   there to do their (often freelance) work, requiring a productive, and
   therefore usually quiet, work environment. Drawing on interviews and
   ethnographic fieldwork in the Netherlands, this research explores how
   users of collective workplaces navigate the coworking paradox: the need
   for quiet workplaces and the desire for social interaction. It shows how
   interactions emerge through rituals and especially routines, and
   describes the spatio-temporal conditions under which these interactions
   may lead to successful forms of social exchange and community formation.},

Volume = {34},
Number = {4},
Pages = {1353-1382},

Abstract = {Given consistent evidence of its social benefits but questions about its
   market viability, this paper examines the conditions under which
   workplace democracy can be understood as a ``real utopia ``; a viable
   form of organization that is both economically productive and socially
   welfare enhancing. Conceptualizing democratic firms as organizations
   with formally distributed authority and collectivist norms, we argue
   that democratic firms will operate more productively in knowledge
   intensive industries, compared with conventional firms in the same
   industries, because they give authority to those with relevant knowledge
   and encourage intrafirm information sharing. Next, focusing on intrafirm
   wage inequality as a key social welfare outcome, we argue that
   knowledge-intensive sectors are also settings where the benefits of
   workplace democracy are likely to be greater. Knowledge intensive
   industries tend to generate greater intrafirm inequality through the
   adoption of market based employment policies and reliance on unique
   expertise, yet the formal structure and collectivist norms of democratic
   firms are likely to limit these mechanisms of inequality, generating
   inequality reductions. We test these hypotheses with longitudinal linked
   employer employee data from French cooperatives and conventional firms,
   including firms that shift organizational structures over time. We find
   robust support for our hypothesis about economic performance and
   moderate support for our hypothesis about social performance.},

Abstract = {We study a fiscal policy model in which the government is present-biased
   towards public spending. Society chooses a fiscal rule to trade off the
   benefit of committing the government to not overspend against the
   benefit of granting it flexibility to react to privately observed shocks
   to the value of spending. Unlike prior work, we examine rules under
   limited enforcement: the government has full policy discretion and can
   only be incentivized to comply with a rule via the use of penalties
   which are joint and bounded. We show that optimal incentives must be
   bang-bang. Moreover, under a distributional condition, the optimal rule
   is a maximally enforced deficit limit, triggering the maximum feasible
   penalty whenever violated. Violation optimally occurs under high enough
   shocks if and only if available penalties are weak and such shocks are
   relatively unlikely. We derive comparative statics showing how rules
   should be calibrated to features of the environment.},

Title = {WHAT MAKES ONE INTRINSICALLY INTERESTED IN IT? AN EXPLORATORY STUDY ON
   INFLUENCES OF AUTISTIC TENDENCY AND GENDER IN THE US AND INDIA},
Journal = {MIS QUARTERLY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {46},
Number = {3},
Pages = {1603-1634},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {To increase diversity and inclusion in IT enrollment and employment, we
   must first answer the question: What makes one intrinsically interested
   in technology in the first place? To the extent that one's choice of an
   IT education and career is driven by such intrinsic interest, the answer
   to this question will inform the various educational and organizational
   efforts to enhance social inclusion through increasing neurodiversity
   and gender diversity. Building on prior literature on the
   empathizing-systemizing (E-S) theory of autism, we employ two studies to
   explore the influences of autistic tendency and gender on intrinsic
   interest in IT. In Study 1, survey data from a U.S. sample provide
   support for autistic tendency as an antecedent of IT interest. The data
   also show that after controlling for individual variations in autistic
   tendency, the seemingly higher IT interest exhibited by U.S. men versus
   women becomes nonsignificant, demonstrating autistic tendency as an
   underlying mechanism by which differences in IT interest manifest
   between men and women. In Study 2, we replicate the model with
   respondents from India. Survey results again provide support for
   autistic tendency as an antecedent of IT interest and further show that
   there exists no significant gender difference in IT interest in India,
   regardless of whether autistic tendency is controlled for. This research
   offers a belated academic acknowledgment of the autism -IT linkage for
   the IS field and a comprehensive introduction of the E-S theory as a
   theoretical lens for multiple areas of IS research, including social
   inclusion, adoption, neuroIS, and evolutionary theory building. The
   finding of a nonsignificant difference in IT interest between men and
   women in the U.S. and India dispels a gender stereotype and demonstrates
   that collective-level gender labels may yield misleading results when
   individual-level factors, such as autistic tendency, masquerade as
   gender differences. Implications for IS practice are also discussed.},

Journal = {REVIEW OF ACCOUNTING STUDIES},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {29},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {We investigate the influence and implications of retail shareholder
   participation in the proxy voting process. Using the shareholder vote on
   auditor ratification-a setting which facilitates the identification of
   an informed vote-we find that, on average, shareholder votes against
   auditor ratification are not associated with audit failures but are
   strongly associated with investment performance. We next consider how
   these relations vary with the composition of a company's voting base and
   find consistent evidence that the auditor ratification vote becomes less
   informed (i.e., associated with factors that do not reflect auditor
   performance) as retail ownership increases. In subsequent tests, we find
   that the probability of auditor dismissal is increasing in the
   proportion of votes against auditor ratification, and that this relation
   does not vary significantly with the proportion of shares held by retail
   investors. Collectively, our results suggest that some auditors are
   dismissed for factors not directly related to auditor performance.},

Title = {Quits Versus Discharges Across Job Levels: Revisiting the Positive Side
   of Turnover},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {49},
Number = {8},
Pages = {2667-2694},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Although the functional effects of turnover have been argued from the
   earliest research in the field, empirical evidence so far supports a
   general negative effect on unit performance, and attempts to explore its
   potential benefits are scarce. It has been argued that one reason for
   the absence of positive effects has to do with a lack of specificity of
   the turnover construct. The present study focuses on two sources of
   specificity: the reason for turnover and the job level of the departing
   employees. Our objective is to perform integrative research to analyze
   their joint effects and discuss how the four turnover scenarios created
   by their combination make their potential benefits of departures
   salient. We integrate arguments from human and social capital theories
   with the literature on team adaptation and change to develop our
   conceptual framework, and test our hypotheses using longitudinal monthly
   data from 5,202 stores of a large fashion multinational retailer in 39
   countries. Our results provide evidence of a curvilinear relationship
   between staff quits and unit performance, and show that discharges are
   linearly beneficial both for managerial and staff positions, although at
   different degrees. Our findings demonstrate that differentiating between
   quits and discharges matters, and that the relative value conveyed by
   the job level of the departing employees is a relevant contingency in
   this distinct effect over performance.},

Abstract = {Employing a novel control function regression method that accounts for

   further find that vega encourages systemically risky policies, including

Title = {Made to be broken? A theory of regulatory governance and rule-breaking
   entrepreneurial action},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BUSINESS VENTURING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {37},
Number = {6},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Although regulatory institutions are said to enable and constrain
   entrepreneurial action, ventures frequently emerge with products,
   processes, and business models that skirt or defy these rules. We
   provide a theory of rule-breaking entrepreneurial action, focusing on
   why entrepreneurs are only sometimes constrained by law, regulation, and
   other formal constraints. In this, we attend to the dual roles of social
   context and subjective interpretation. Drawing on the sociology of law,
   we position regulatory rules within a system of governance, where public
   actors and legal in-termediaries collectively construct the meaning of
   rule compliance and enact sanctions to enforce this interpretation. We
   leverage this to describe how enforcement imperfections and
   heteroge-neous rule interpretations give rise to the possibility of
   `black market' and `gray market' entre-preneurial actions. In turn, we
   theorize how actors' knowledge and motivations can lead them to identify
   and exploit breakable rule conditions via the creation of new ventures.
   We illustrate our framework with examples from startups Zenefits,
   Square, and Aereo. Our framework changes the way we think about
   regulatory institutions and entrepreneurial action by presenting
   governance as a multilevel, social, and subjective process-such that
   some actors conform their entrepre-neurial activities to established
   rules while others recognize and exploit breakable rule conditions.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ETHICS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {185},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {This first wave study of the Covid-19 pandemic investigates why the
   governments of different countries proceeded to lockdown at different
   speeds. We draw upon the literature on Corporate Governance Institutions
   (CGIs) to theorize that governments' decision-making is undertaken in
   the light of prevailing beliefs, norms, and rules of the collectivity,
   as portrayed by the focal country's CGIs, in their effort to maintain
   legitimacy. In addition, drawing on motivated cognition we posit that
   the government's political ideology moderates this relationship because
   decision-makers are biased when assessing the impact of lockdown on
   commerce. Running negative binomial regressions on a sample of 125
   countries, we find that the more shareholder-oriented the CGIs, the
   slower the governmental response in shutting down the economy to protect
   from the pandemic. Moreover, the main relationship is stronger the more
   right-leaning the government's ideology. Our study contributes to the
   research on corporate governance institutions and political ideology and
   illustrates how societal and ideological biases affect government
   decision-making, especially when important decisions about public
   welfare are taken with little information on hand.},

Abstract = {This study comprehensively evaluates and ranks a large number of
   competing explanations for the momentum anomaly. As a benchmark for
   evaluation, firm fundamentals are found to be the most promising among
   well-known explanations of momentum, followed by prospect theory and
   mental accounting, and anchoring effect. Collectively, all explanations
   capture 31\% of momentum, whereas 69\% of momentum remains unexplained.
   This study thoroughly examines what fractions of the momentum anomaly
   emerge from the interaction effects between past returns and various
   firm characteristics. It is further found that strategies based on firm
   characteristics and residual momentum can significantly alleviate the
   severity of momentum crashes. Finally, robustness analysis is provided
   for choosing different formation and holding periods, excluding January
   observations, and analyze at the level of portfolio rather than

Abstract = {Despite advancements in our understanding of organizational paradox, we
   know little about how individuals navigate paradox when tensions are
   core to one's occupational role but not a dominant concern for senior
   leaders. This study explores how grantmakers working in corporate
   philanthropy navigate a business-society paradox when their leaders
   prioritize business over social objectives at the organization level. By
   analyzing interview data from grantmakers, alongside observations of
   their group meetings, I induce a peer-based model of navigating paradox.
   The findings reveal the important supportive role of relationships with
   ``paradox peers{''}-ongoing, cooperative connections to individuals
   external to one's organization but facing similar paradoxical
   challenges. I detail three relational mechanisms for engaging paradox
   that together facilitate the ability of individuals to navigate paradox
   in their home organizations: connecting with others to relieve tension,
   collectively protecting the paradox, and collaboratively brainstorming
   responses. My findings shift paradox scholarship toward a more
   relational understanding of navigating paradoxes, exploring how engaging
   tensions outside of one's organizational boundaries can support the
   navigation of paradox internally.},

Abstract = {Archival research reports that managers often use the FIN 48 uncertain
   tax liability accrual to manage earnings. To assess solutions to this
   problem, we deconstruct the ethical and psychological reasoning that
   leads to FIN 48 opportunistic behavior. Hence, we employ a survey of
   seasoned accounting managers to assess the influences of cynicism, two
   measures of moral disengagement, and pressure from a CFO on the
   propensity to engage in FIN 48 earnings management. Specifically, we
   manipulate the influence of the study scenario supervisory CFO as either
   a latent bully or a transformational leader. While the CFO bully main
   effect condition enhances FIN 48 earnings management, the CFO
   transformational leader condition interacts with less cynical accounting
   managers to reduce FIN 48 earnings management. We also find that both
   dispositional trait and situational state moral disengagement factors
   independently mediate the relationship between the cynicism model
   antecedent and FIN 48 earnings management. Collectively, study findings
   provide implications for both theory and practice.},

Journal = {ORGANIZATION STUDIES},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {44},
Number = {6},
Pages = {939-960},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {This paper responds to the emergent calls for recovering the role of
   contentious politics in prefigurative communities to more effectively
   transform capitalist institutions. Theoretically drawing on the work of
   Judith Butler, our paper points to the importance of addressing the
   institutional frames that demarcate who will be (mis)recognized in the
   public space and which are at the core of politics. Our analysis of the
   Coop case shows how prefigurative and contentious politics are not
   incompatible, but can rather strengthen each other in a virtuous circle.
   When articulated to redefine existing institutional frames, they can
   reduce precarity. Through this articulation an assembly is constituted
   where a redefined subject can emerge outside the precarizing frames of
   neoliberalism. At the same time, our analysis suggests that Coop's
   political practices do not completely redefine the individualized,
   calculative neoliberal subject. Project workers embraced the assembly
   only to the extent that it helped them reduce their self-responsibility
   and advance their professional and life projects. Overall, these
   insights advance the literature on grassroots organizations by showing
   the importance of contentious politics in attempting to redefine the
   institutional frames, as opposed to solely relying on prefigurative
   politics outside institutions. Yet they simultaneously confirm the
   difficulty of redefining the precarious neoliberal subject through
   collective emancipatory projects.},

Journal = {ORGANIZATION STUDIES},

Volume = {44},
Number = {3},
Pages = {427-450},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Research has demonstrated how the translation of a new management
   concept into organizational practices is impacted by the translators'
   engagement with their local context. We expand this literature by
   demonstrating how a heterogeneous institutional context prompts
   translators to create practice change and also practice maintenance.
   Building upon an interpretive analytical framework we offer a way
   forward to examine relationships between societal institutions and
   distributed collective work in change processes. Our longitudinal
   qualitative study based upon interviews and observations examines how
   the concept of value-based healthcare was translated at a hospital. The
   translators developed three micro-tactics: disregard, maintenance and
   displacement, grounded in their narration of practice changes.
   Translators enacted institutional logics differently at the levels of
   meaning and practice when they framed, rationalized and contextualized
   the potentialities of a new concept, and this complexity provided the
   possibility of various practice outcomes. We contribute to the
   understanding of translation by demonstrating how a heterogeneous
   institutional context encourages translators to change selected
   practices but also to decouple and maintain most of the existing
   practices due to their enactment of institutionalized rationalities.
   Moreover, we discuss how translation outcomes are impacted by
   collaborating actors' shared interpretations of their institutional
   context. Collaborating translators need to agree on whether and what
   practice change is valuable for the organization, and change is only
   possible when they interpret that they have the leverage to align a new
   idea with dominant institutional logics.},

Abstract = {Humans are a fundamentally social species, having evolved in groups with
   status hierarchies. However, research on the dimensions of individual
   ability has largely overlooked the domain of status. Building upon
   research on the individual-level benefits of accurate status
   perceptions, we propose that there exists an individual dispositional
   ability to perceive groups' informal status hierarchies, which we call
   status acuity, and which has important implications for group dynamics.
   We find support for the existence and importance of status acuity across
   several studies. In Studies 1a and 1b, we develop and validate a measure
   of status acuity, find that it is distinct from previously studied
   individual abilities including emotional intelligence, cognitive
   intelligence, and accurate learning of social networks, and find that it
   predicts important individual outcomes at work. In Studies 2 and 3, we
   examine the effects of status acuity in face-to-face groups. As
   predicted, groups whose members have higher status acuity experience
   less status conflict, which benefits performance on creative
   idea-generation as well as problem-solving tasks. This work extends
   existing research on status and group dynamics, and contributes to our
   understanding of the constellation of human abilities, offering a new
   answer to the question: ``How well does this person work in groups?{''}},

   this ecosystem as a complex adaptive one and we propose a framework that
   integrates key structural (open boundaries and relational constitution),
   emergent (contextual and complex causality), and temporal (dynamic and
   adaptive) properties. To deepen lines of inquiry around these defining
   elements, we advance a series of propositions for testing, and we
   outline a range of theoretical, methodological, and practical

Abstract = {While the shareholder benefits of audits are well documented, evidence
   on whether audits can facilitate opportunistic behavior by corporate
   insiders is scarce. In this paper, we examine whether the audit process
   facilitates one particular form of opportunism: informed trading by
   corporate insiders. We focus our analysis on insider trading around the
   audit report date. We find an increase in trading around the audit
   report date and that the increase is abnormally large for firms that
   subsequently report modified opinions. The abnormal increase in trading
   is concentrated among officers and non-audit committee independent
   directors, and most pronounced in first-time modified opinions and
   modified opinions in years where financial results are subsequently
   restated. These trades are highly opportunistic: they predict
   restatements, and as a consequence, we show they avoid significant
   losses. Collectively, our findings provide novel evidence that insiders
   appear to exploit private information about the audit process--a process
   ostensibly designed to protect shareholders--for opportunistic gain.},

Abstract = {Social media firestorms (SMF) are commonly seen as destructive forces of
   toxic comments hurled at a target for perceived wrongdoing. Yet some
   research suggests that SMF can provide beneficial outcomes for the
   target. In two studies, we qualitatively examine SMF comments (in terms
   of purpose and tone) and quantitatively examine users' motivations for
   making different types of comments. Results show that SMF comments are
   diverse, either supporting or condemning the target and being either
   aggressive or cordial in tone. Further, the results show that users'
   understanding of the triggering event in the real world influences the
   purpose of their comment (support or condemn) while disinhibition and
   others' online comments (i.e., herd influence) shape how they comment
   (tone). We conclude with an expanded SMF definition as ``A digital

Title = {Supply chain transformation and technology management challenges in
   developing regions: Inductive theory building from rural Chinese
   nanostores},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT},

Volume = {68},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Rural nanostores are the dominant source of packaged products for
   consumers in rural China, thus the more these stores order from reliable
   suppliers, the better the product quality available to rural areas. To
   improve merchandise circulation in rural areas, the Chinese government
   embarked on the large-scale ``Thousands of Villages{''} (ToV) program in
   2005. One of its key components was the implementation of an information
   technology (IT) procurement system to facilitate transactions between
   rural nanostores and the ToV program's certified consumer packaged goods
   (CPG) suppliers. The nanostores' adoption of the ToV procurement system
   was encouraged yet voluntary. We study how this system was used
   initially and how it evolved over time. If effective, this program has
   the potential to address the growing social disparity between rural and
   developed areas in China. We first embarked on an exploratory analysis
   (March 2012) to understand the ToV program from the perspectives of
   nanostore owners, the ToV's CPG suppliers, and the government. We then
   collected interview data. In Period 1 (2013-2014), when the technology
   was still nascent, we found that nanostore owner's trust in the ToV's
   CPG suppliers, and system value, played key roles for nanostore owners
   to use the ToV procurement system. In Period 2 (2018-2019), three
   contextual factors emerged-population demographic shift, improved
   technology infrastructure, and trust in new {[}non-ToV] purchasing
   platforms-each hindering the ToV procurement system's use. We observed
   strong government support during the early phases of ToV, but that
   support evolved from subsidizing the ToV platform and offering
   associated training (Period 1), to also providing credibility to
   competing non-ToV procurement platforms (Period 2). Collectively, the
   findings identify idiosyncratic challenges that arise when public
   policies attempt to address developing region problems by reengineering
   supply chains via IT. We provide implications for IT research about
   technology management in rural developing areas and for managers to
   recognize potential pitfalls of managing IT projects in supply bases
   unfamiliar with advanced IT.},

Abstract = {Resource scarcity, manifested through limited time, money or space, is a
   prevalent aspect of family life. Drawing on depth interviews with 30
   families from diverse demographic backgrounds, this study develops a
   framework to demonstrate how families respond to resource scarcity. Our
   research examines how multi-dimensional, concurrent and/or consecutive
   life events, such as job changes, house moves, or childbirth, create a
   mismatch between available and required resources to trigger situational
   resource scarcity. We identify different patterns of adjustments in
   consumption and resource investment over time, based on families'
   chronic resources and reliance on support networks. Notably, the greater
   flexibility afforded by multiple family members is constrained by
   collective goals, domains of control, tensions and negotiations.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ETHICS},

Volume = {185},
Number = {1},

Abstract = {We examine the impact of employing a female, versus a male, leader on
   future (t + 1) donations and operating margin using a sample of 4387
   unique nonprofit organizations (NPOs) between 2011 and 2014. Using
   two-stage and matched sample designs, we find that NPOs headed by female
   leaders report higher future operating margins but lower future
   donations. We interpret these findings to mean that female leaders are
   more focused on fiscal responsibility than fundraising. We also find
   that female leaders with past fundraising experience attenuate lower
   future donations, and at commercial nonprofits, female leaders with
   prior for-profit experience contribute to even higher operating margins.
   Moreover, while female leaders identified as the founder of the
   organization increase future donations, they have no effect on future
   operating margins. Collectively, the results of our study should
   increase nonprofit boards' confidence in hiring female leaders thereby
   narrowing the gender disparity in leadership in the nonprofit sector.
   This study expands the extant literature by providing initial evidence
   on the effects of female leaders in NPOs thereby contributing to
   research exploring gender, diversity, management, and nonprofit
   executives.},

Abstract = {This study examines the effect of regulatory approval on a firm's
   voluntary product-level disclosures. We focus on the US biotechnology
   industry, a setting that allows direct observation of whether firms
   disclose more information as products proceed through
   well-defined-though successively more complex and costly-regulatory
   hurdles. Consistent with predictions motivated by biotech firms' need to
   repeatedly raise capital, we find that firms disclose more as their
   products move to later stages in the development process, both when the
   products receive regulatory approvals as well as when they receive
   regulatory denials. In addition, these findings are consistent across
   phases of development as well as product disclosure categories and are
   accentuated for firms without internal sources of capital (i.e., lacking
   product revenue). Collectively, these findings reveal that biotechnology
   firms respond to the considerable incentives to provide enhanced product
   disclosure and thus facilitate their ongoing need for capital to proceed
   through subsequent stages of product development.},

Abstract = {Though the customer journey (CJ) is gaining traction, its limited
   customer focus overlooks the dynamics characterizing other stakeholders'
   (e.g., employees'/suppliers') journeys, thus calling for an extension to
   the stakeholder journey (SJ). Addressing this gap, we advance the SJ,
   which covers any stakeholder's journey with the firm. We argue that
   firms' consideration of the SJ, defined as a stakeholder's trajectory of
   role-related touchpoints and activities, enacted through stakeholder
   engagement, that collectively shape the stakeholder experience with the
   firm, enhances their stakeholder relationship management and performance
   outcomes. We also view the SJ in a network of intersecting journeys that
   are characterized by interdependence theory's structural tenets of
   stakeholder control, covariation of interest, mutuality of dependence,
   information availability, and temporal journey structure, which we view
   to impact stakeholders' journey-based engagement and experience, as
   formalized in a set of Propositions. We conclude with theoretical (e.g.,
   further research) and practical (e.g., SJ design/management)
   implications.},

Abstract = {Although recent evidence suggests that individual audit partners explain
   a substantial portion of the variation in audit quality proxies, much
   less is known about what determines an audit partner's quality.
   Psychology and behavioral economics theories hold that an individual's
   experiences can have enduring impacts on subsequent behavior. We examine
   whether auditors' direct exposure to Arthur Andersen's collapse has a
   long-term impact on the quality of their audits. Our evidence implies
   that audit partners who directly experienced Andersen's demise impose
   stricter monitoring evident in their clients exhibiting a lower
   propensity for misstatements and small profits, and paying higher audit
   fees. Importantly, these findings reconcile with research in finance and
   economics implying that firsthand experiences matter more to subsequent
   behavior than general economic conditions or secondhand or thirdhand
   experiences. Collectively, the results shed light on one facet of how
   partners' audit quality evolves over time. Our findings suggest that
   major failures associated with the audit firm in which an auditor works
   can ultimately result in these affected individuals later delivering
   higher audit quality, which should benefit audit committees in partner
   selection decisions and audit firms in designing partner assignment
   policies.},

Title = {Do Firm-Specific Stock Price Crashes Lead to a Stimulation or Distortion

Abstract = {Unlike prior research that focuses on determinants of firm-specific
   stock price crashes (SPCs), we study the consequences of SPCs on market
   information efficiency. The tension underlying our research question
   stems from two competing explanations. As an unanticipated shock, an SPC
   could stimulate (distort) information efficiency by triggering investor
   rational attention (opinion divergence). Our identification strategy
   involves a difference-in-differences analysis in which SPC firms in the
   treatment sample are propensity score matched with non-SPC firms in the
   industry-peer control sample, as well as placebo tests for
   falsification. Consistent with the stimulation effect, we find an
   increase of the earnings response coefficient and a decrease in
   post-earnings announcement drift, from the pre- to post-SPC period, for
   SPC firms, but not for non-SPC firms. Further analyses reveal that SPC
   firms attract increased investor attention, as reflected in greater
   analyst coverage and more investor access to firms' online financial
   filings following such an event. Using mutual fund flow redemption
   pressure based on hypothetical sales as an exogenous shock to SPCs, we
   provide evidence corroborating our causal interpretation of the main
   findings. Collectively, the evidence suggests that SPCs can attract
   increased investor attention, bringing about positive externalities by
   stimulating market information efficiency.},

Abstract = {With an emphasis on deliberative processes that occur between managers
   and stakeholders, the political corporate social responsibility (PCSR)
   literature has made important advances to our understanding of CSR
   activities. However, these contributions have tended to focus
   exclusively on organizational settings. We contend that an understanding
   of firm-level CSR is incomplete without considering the interrelations
   between organizations and the wider socio-political environment.
   Building on work in comparative politics about formal and informal
   institutions, we posit that firm-level CSR will rise as the deliberative
   capacity of political institutions increases. The term deliberative
   capacity refers to the capacity of political institutions to enable
   diverse stakeholders to collectively assemble and voice their opinions.
   Findings from our analysis of 21,941 firm-year observations, comprising
   3563 unique firms from 34 countries over the 2005-2017 period, suggest
   that the deliberative capacity of formal and informal institutions not
   only enhances firm-level CSR activities independently but also
   complements the deliberative processes at an organizational level in
   promoting CSR.},

Title = {When Do Evaluators Publicly Express Their Legitimacy Judgments? An
   Inquiry into the Role of Peer Endorsement and Evaluative Mode},
Journal = {ORGANIZATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {34},
Number = {6, SI},
Pages = {2143-2162},
Month = {NOV-DEC},
Abstract = {Legitimacy theory describes how individuals evaluate an organization's
   behavior, form propriety evaluations, and subsequently decide whether to
   publicly express their legitimacy judgments. These individual judgments
   are influenced by sources of collective validity, for example, from
   recognized authority or from peer endorsement. Whereas most research on
   this topic has focused on the effects of authority, we study the
   influence of peer endorsement on the public expression of legitimacy
   judgments. Additionally, we assess evaluators' preparedness to expend
   cognitive effort, that is, their evaluative mode, as an important
   condition under which judgment expressions are made. We present a set of
   three vignette experiments and one field study, all situated in social
   media that are quickly becoming the dominant setting for the expression
   of legitimacy judgments. This research provides new evidence that peer
   endorsement stimulates evaluators to express their judgments,
   particularly for evaluators who expend limited cognitive effort.
   Additionally, we find that evaluators in the active and passive
   evaluative modes act differently when their propriety evaluations are
   based on instrumental, moral, or relational considerations. These
   findings extend current legitimacy theory about how peer endorsement
   functions as a source of validity and when individual evaluators decide
   to publicly express their legitimacy judgments. This is important
   because individuals' public expressions can bring about a cascade of
   judgments that change the consensus on an organization's legitimacy,
   potentially contributing to institutional change.},

Title = {Communities at the nexus of entrepreneurship and societal impact: A
   cross-disciplinary literature review},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BUSINESS VENTURING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {37},
Number = {5},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Although there is wide recognition of the importance of entrepreneurship
   for generating societal impact, entrepreneurial activities alone rarely
   achieve a positive impact without the engagement of communities. To
   date, however, entrepreneurship researchers have tended to overlook the
   importance of community for creating societal impact through
   entrepreneurship, and lack a comprehensive understanding of the nature
   and roles of communities. To address this, we conduct a systematic
   review of the literature published in 51 journals across the Management
   and Entrepreneurship, Economic Development/Community Development,
   Economic Geography and Regional Science, Energy, and Public
   Administration disciplines that makes three contributions. First, it
   identifies a new typology of community and proposes a comprehensive
   framework of roles through which societal impact is created by
   entrepreneurship for, in, with, enabled by, and driven by communities.
   Second, it demonstrates that the key to understanding how community
   relates to societal impact creation is to jointly account for both its
   type(s) and role(s). By linking community types and roles, the findings
   also suggest a theoretical contribution based on the relationship
   between the degree of formalization of a community type, and the degree
   of agency that a community role enacts. Third, the review underscores
   that communities are not just static settings but can also be dynamic
   actors in efforts to use entrepreneurship to create societal impact. Our
   cross-disciplinary review highlights trends and gaps in the extant
   literature and provides researchers with an evidence-based research
   agenda to guide future inquiry on this vital topic.},

Abstract = {Through an inductive field study, we set out to better understand how
   and why ventures would embrace a non-core stigma; this is perplexing
   given that a majority of stigma literature suggests that organizations
   tend to avoid/disidentify from stigmatized entities. To do so, we study
   organizational locational stigma, which we define as a label arising
   from an organization's geographic location that evokes a collective
   stakeholder group-specific perception that an organization possesses a
   fundamental, deep-seated flaw that deindividuates and discredits the
   organization. Our findings from Detroit, Michigan reveal that
   entrepreneurs embrace the locational stigma by taking part in Detroit's
   underdog narrative and comeback story. Entrepreneurs use the underdog
   narrative in hope of differentiating their ventures from those in other
   locations, while they leverage the comeback story to gain access to the
   resources and in-group advantages. We thus advance the concept of
   locational stigma and show how it can benefit organizations.},

Abstract = {From ancient time, Homo sapiens moved around in search of a better life.
   Although the development of agriculture and industrialization no longer
   necessitates frequently moving to find new food sources, people today
   still change their residences for a variety of reasons. This article
   highlights key findings from residential mobility, focusing on its
   implications for the self, social relationships, societies, and
   well-being. Generally, residential mobility shifts individual attention
   away from collective attributes toward personal attributes. It also
   changes people's relationship styles and preferences, leading
   individuals to favor wider social networks, more open communication,
   low-commitment groups, and egalitarian helpers. In addition, it
   increases tolerance for norm violations and moral deviations. Lastly,
   residential mobility can explain some cross-national and within-nation
   variations. This article reviews recent psychological research on
   residential mobility and then discusses limitations, paradoxical
   findings, and future directions.},

Abstract = {Research Summary Organizations rely on subjective evaluations to reward
   employees for team-based performance. However, it is unclear how
   supervisors determine individuals' contributions to collective output.
   We theorize that supervisors rely on the covariance between employees'
   presence and their teams' productivity. If teams are more productive
   when an employee is present, the supervisor may infer a greater
   contribution from the employee. Using data from a manufacturing firm, we
   find that covariation between an employee's presence and her team's
   output has a positive effect on her evaluation. This relationship is
   stronger when supervisors have more opportunities to observe an employee
   across various teams and when the employee has more authority to direct
   team production, supporting counterfactual information as an important
   component of evaluations for individuals engaged in team production.
   Managerial Summary It is notoriously difficult to evaluate the
   individual performance of employees when the only available metric is
   team-based output. We suggest that supervisors help solve this problem
   by observing how team output correlates with changes in team membership.
   We construct a measure of the covariance between an employee's presence
   in a team and the team's productivity, and find a positive relationship
   between this measure and the employee's annual subjective performance
   evaluation. Our results indicate that subjective evaluations reflect
   individual contributions to team production fairly well for employees
   who (a) have sufficient authority to direct team production and (b) are
   frequently rotated beyond a single team. We discuss what kinds of
   organizations might benefit from this measure as an input to their
   performance evaluation processes.},

Title = {Commensuration by form: Lists and accounting in collective action
   networks},
Journal = {ACCOUNTING ORGANIZATIONS AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {100},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {This paper studies the roles of accounting in decentralized and
   unregulated collective action networks. Although the recent past has
   witnessed a proliferation of social collectives, little is known about
   accounting in such loose and fluid forms of organizing. While the
   existence of putatively primitive accountings becomes discernible in
   some studies on collective action, literature has largely neglected to
   discuss these in more detail. Taking a conceptual diversion via the
   format of the list, this paper ascribes such rudimentary and short-lived
   accounting instantiations a more critical and integrated role in
   governing the network at large. We develop the notion of commensuration
   by form to account for the list's dual capacity to convert the world
   into boxes of equivalent size that can flexibly be reshuffled into new
   relationships and its ability to serve as an intruder to the world of
   accounting. The upshot of this perspective, a significant expansion of
   accounting's non-calculative structuring powers, is demonstrated by an
   in-depth study of a collective action network formed during the German
   refugee crisis in 2015. While repertoires of digital and analog lists
   formed the backbone of the network's infrastructure, we show how their
   creation, recombination, and growing dispersion constantly provoked
   arrays of dispersed micro accountings. Even if such accountings
   interfered with the lists for only a moment, we nevertheless observed
   their ability to leave more permanent traces by irrevocably
   residualizing, prioritizing or canceling out items in such lists. We
   argue that the interplay between listing and accounting is ever more
   relevant in times when collective organizing is reliant upon digital
   media technologies that have accelerated the production and circulation
   of the list as never before in history.(c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {While there have been several studies on overt forms of marginalization,
   few have examined benevolent marginalization, where peoplemay
   unquestioningly participate in their own paternalistic subjugation by
   following a prescribed identity. How might such individuals end up
   achieving emancipation from an infantilizing identity? To address this
   puzzle, we conducted a longitudinal study of a German sheltered
   workshop, an organization providing employment for disabled people. We
   observed that workers with disability initially maintained a regulating
   organizational identity based on paternalistic segregation. However,
   over time, they constructed their own self-determining identity and
   coproduced a change in the workshop's identity from{''}shelter{''} to
   ``inclusion.{''} First, we show that in order to coconstruct their
   preferred self-concept, benevolently marginalized individuals need to
   gain the support of those in power, who change their role from a
   guardian to an ally. Second, while achieving liberation from overt
   marginalization is likely to involve confrontation with one's
   oppressors, we suggest that achieving emancipation from benevolent
   marginalization is a collaborative process of mutual consciousness
   raising and sensitization. Third, while changes of identity may occur
   after exposure to alternative discourses, often involving the
   contentious performances of external activists, we show how insider
   activists mobilize collective action for change within a protectionist
   organization.},

Abstract = {We examine the effect of audit firm political connections on the
   harshness of Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB)
   inspection reports. Relying on Regulatory Capture Theory and Motivated
   Reasoning Theory, we show audit firm political connections, as measured
   through PAC contributions, are negatively associated with the harshness
   of Part I reports. Our results are robust to instrumentation and are not
   due to movements of personnel between the PCAOB and audit firms or
   improvements in a firm's audit quality. In supplementary tests, we show
   the negative relation is stronger when we consider the directed nature
   of PAC contributions to members of Congress who exercise SEC oversight
   and robust to alternative measures. Finally, we consider the harshness
   of Part II inspection reports and find no association with political
   connections. Collectively, our results suggest audit firm political
   connections induce favorable influence over Part I findings of PCAOB
   inspection reports. (c) 2022 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Hype is a collective vision and promise of a possible future, around
   which attention, excitement, and expectations increase over time. Within
   nascent markets, hype can thus serve as a cultural resource by which
   entrepreneurs might encourage greater early stakeholder support and
   resources. Yet, as hype-driven support couples with mounting temporal
   and categorical expectations, this can also limit ventures' flexibility
   during the entrepreneurial process. Drawing on an inductive,
   longitudinal, and comparative study of three new ventures within the
   much-hyped nascent market of impact investing, we develop an emergent
   theory of hype management, illustrating the field organizing practices
   that give rise to different forms of social proof, thereby allowing new
   ventures sufficient flexibility to convert hype into a sustained
   entrepreneurial opportunity. Our account contributes directly to
   contemporary public conversations of hype by revealing how entrepreneurs
   might engage with, and indeed live up to, the hype surrounding nascent
   markets without succumbing to the deceit and disappointment typically
   associated with hype. Beyond this, our findings extend existing
   scholarship on entrepreneurship within nascent markets, the sociology of
   expectations, and the realization of distant futures.},

Abstract = {We study the connection between communication network structure and an
   organization's collective adaptability to a shifting environment.
   Research has shown that network centralization-the degree to which
   communication flows disproportionately through one or more members of
   the organization rather than being more equally distributed-interferes
   with collective problem-solving by obstructing the integration of
   existing ideas, information, and solutions in the network. We
   hypothesize that the mechanisms responsible for that poor integration of
   ideas, information, and solutions would nevertheless prove beneficial
   for problems requiring adaptation to a shifting environment. We
   conducted a 1,620-subject randomized online laboratory experiment,
   testing the effect of seven network structures on problem-solving
   success. To simulate a shifting environment, we designed a murder
   mystery task and manipulated when each piece of information could be
   found: early information encouraged an inferior consensus, requiring a
   collective shift of solution after more information emerged. We find
   that when the communication network within an organization is more
   centralized, it achieves the benefits of connectivity (spread of novel
   better solutions) without the costs (getting stuck on an existing
   inferior solution). We also find, however, that these benefits of
   centralization only materialize in networks with two-way flow of
   information and not when information only flows from the center of the
   network outward (as can occur in hierarchical structures or digitally
   mediated communication). We draw on these findings to reconceptualize
   theory on the impact of centralization-and how it affects conformity
   pressure (lock-in) and awareness of diverse ideas (learning)-on
   collective problem-solving that demands adaptation.},

Abstract = {Research Summary Faced with demand uncertainty and heterogeneity in a
   nascent industry, entrants often consider how many customer segments to
   serve by tailoring the usage breadth of their product portfolios.
   Portfolio usage breadth is the extent to which products in a portfolio
   collectively span distinct customer segments. We suggest that when
   entrants have use experience in contexts that are potential users of the
   new product, their portfolios exhibit low usage breadth, due to
   demand-oriented cognition and knowledge. The relationship is stronger
   for diversifying entrants relative to startups. The empirical context is
   the U.S. commercial drone industry, wherein entrants need to adapt their
   product portfolios for five robust and distinct customer segments of
   photography, short-distance inspection, long-distance surveying,
   agriculture, and aerial supply chain management. Managerial Summary New
   industries often serve multiple customer segments, each with different
   preferences. Entrants can either launch products catering to the
   specific preferences of customers in a small number of segments or
   launch products targeting numerous segments. Evidence from the U.S
   commercial drone industry shows that when entrants have experience in
   one of the customer segments adopting the new industry's product, they
   tend to introduce products targeting fewer segments. By recognizing the
   impact of prior experiences on product portfolio development,
   entrepreneurial leaders gain insights to assess whether their cognitive
   alignment with a customer segment has restricted their broader
   exploration of the demand environment, or whether their superior demand
   knowledge about a customer segment has created a competitive advantage.},

   Governance Choice},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MARKETING},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {87},
Number = {1},
Pages = {45-63},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The authors draw on emerging research in organization theory to suggest
   how different firm-level identity orientations (individualistic,
   relational, or collectivistic) impact governance choice. They develop a
   conceptual framework that focuses on the relationship between a focal
   firm's own identity orientation and that of a value chain partner. The
   framework identifies a series of match and mismatch scenarios, where the
   latter represent unique governance problems that are not accounted for
   by existing theory. Some of the mismatch scenarios involve
   pseudo-matches that resemble convergent orientations between parties but
   actually represent governance problems. Theoretically, this framework
   advances the governance literature by providing a comprehensive and
   nuanced account of (1) the orientations that parties bring to bear on a
   relationship, and (2) how their effects vary depending on the
   interdependence structure between the parties. The authors also advance
   the general literature on identity orientation by connecting it to
   concrete governance practices, by showing how multiple internal identity
   orientations create unique internal governance challenges, and by
   delineating two possible solutions to these challenges. They rely on the
   framework to develop managerial guidelines for governance choice.},

Title = {Value Destruction in Information Technology Ecosystems: A Mixed-Method
   Investigation with Interpretive Case Study and Analytical Modeling},
Journal = {INFORMATION SYSTEMS RESEARCH},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {34},
Number = {2},
Pages = {508-531},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Many of today's software systems are created by leveraging ecosystems
   consisting of heterogeneous ``complementors{''} and ``hub{''} firms. In
   fact, the reliance on ecosystems is prevalent in the enterprise resource
   planning (ERP) domain, where larger ERP vendors form collaborative
   relationships with smaller industry-specific vendors to co-create value
   for themselves and their customers. However, value creation and
   destruction processes are often intertwined. A key motivation for this
   study is to shed light on the behavioral contingencies and underlying
   mechanisms that might lead to value destruction over time instead of the
   initially intended value co-creation. Furthermore, although value
   co-creation in collaborative relationships associated with ecosystems is
   often highlighted, research has been scarce on offering an in-depth
   analysis of the challenges in these relationships that can destroy
   value. This study attempts to address this issue by uncovering the
   underlying mechanisms that lead a hub firm and its complementors toward
   value destruction. Our mixed-methods approach involves the use of a
   combination of interpretive case study and analytical modeling to
   highlight nuances and develop conceptual propositions about the
   conditions that can potentially lead to value destruction. Our context
   is a globally reputed information technology (IT) firmknown for
   providing business solutions (SOFTCo, a pseudonym) and numerous
   relatively small, less powerful customer-facing service firms
   (PartnerCos, a pseudonym). Our findings show that opportunism, unjust
   appropriation of rents, shirking, exploitation of asymmetric power, and
   undue dependence can initiate a value destruction process. Furthermore,
   our study revealed an unexpected emergence of a ``pack of wolves,{''}
   where resentful PartnerCos formed a collective to tackle the
   opportunistic behaviors of SOFTCo by starting to align with its
   competitor, further destroying value for SOFTCo's ecosystem. Overall,
   this study contributes to the literature on value
   co-creation/destruction in IT ecosystems. It also offers an illustration
   of a mixed-methods study where seemingly incommensurable approaches are
   harnessed to develop a theoretical understanding.},

Abstract = {For economic agents seeking to organize collectively, opportunism is a
   central concern - any invasion by opportunistic agents can threaten an
   organization's viability. To understand how economic agents address this
   concern, we examine Magnum Photos, an enduring elite cooperative of
   freelance photographers that screened prospective members based on
   shared values. We identify two mechanisms through which these shared
   values engendered non-calculative trust that renders collective
   organizing economically viable. We unpack how this values-based trust
   attenuates hazards of opportunism and promotes risk bearing and
   innovation when property rights are appropriately assigned to individual
   members and the size of the collective organization remains relatively
   small. We maintain that Magnum can be regarded as a form of collective
   entrepreneurship adopted by risk bearing agents bound together by shared
   values. We provide unique insight into how economic agents in industries
   beset by measurement problems can organize collectively around shared
   values to mitigate opportunism and innovate.},

Title = {Conceiving opposites together: Cultivating paradoxical frames and
   epistemic motivation fosters team creativity},
Journal = {ORGANIZATIONAL BEHAVIOR AND HUMAN DECISION PROCESSES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {171},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {To successfully generate creative solutions, teams must reconcile
   inconsistent perspectives and integrate competing task demands. We
   suggest that adopting a paradoxical frame - a mental template that
   promotes recognizing and embracing the simultaneous existence of
   seemingly contradictory elements - helps teams navigate this process to
   produce creative ideas, if team members are epistemically motivated. Our
   results from two laboratory studies (N = 950) suggest that teams that
   adopt paradoxical frames and have high epistemic motivation develop more
   creative solutions than teams with paradoxical frames and low epistemic
   motivation or epistemically motivated teams with frames that only
   encourage information sharing. Teams with paradoxical frames and high
   epistemic motivation are more creative because they engage in idea
   elaboration - they exchange, consider, and integrate diverse ideas and
   perspectives. By contrast, other teams settle on suboptimal middle-way
   solutions that do not address task demands. Our research advances
   knowledge of why and when paradoxical frames benefit team creativity, by
   unpacking the processes that enable teams to leverage task and team
   tensions. We show that when teams collectively work through their
   tensions and elaborate their diverse ideas they become more creative.},

   peers in these incentive plans. Our findings indicate that managers of
   such firms take more frequent as well as more complex competitive
   actions, relative to managers evaluated on relative performance without
   peer group overlap. Moreover, we show that these competitive tactics are
   more pronounced when managers compete against: (1) peers with similar
   grant sizes, (2) peers on similar performance metrics, and (3) peers in
   the same industry. Collectively, our findings provide evidence on how
   widely used incentive-compensation practices relate to strategic firm

Abstract = {This study investigated entrepreneurs' motivations to implement circular
   economy (CE) practices and the ways in which their approaches to CE
   practices differed by their sociocultural context. The research aimed to
   contrast the contemporary instrumental perspective on CE through an
   ecologically dominant logic. The empirical analysis focused on Finland
   and Japan, two countries with distinct sociocultural contexts but
   similar regulatory environments regarding the CE. The study analysed
   entrepreneurs' motivations towards the CE through self-determination
   theory that makes a distinction between different levels of
   internalization in motivations. The Finnish entrepreneurs were
   characterised by more frequent intertwined intrinsic/transcendent
   motivations and a vocal approach to CE. The Japanese entrepreneurs'
   motivations were more varied; some were intrinsically interested in the
   CE, while some were even unaware of the CE concept despite operating CE
   businesses. The Japanese entrepreneurs resorted to masking their CE
   businesses to better relate with the surrounding linear system. The
   study shows how the individualistic Finnish culture fostered progress on
   the CE, while the collectivistic Japanese culture emphasised the need
   for relatedness and caused stagnation in the CE in its society.},

Abstract = {During the past 10 years, the field of human capital resources (HCR),
   often referred to as strategic human capital (SHC), has gained interest
   in both micro and macro disciplines. This increase in attention from a
   diverse set of researchers has shifted the focus of the field to topics
   such as identifying different types of HCR, HCR emergence, and links
   between collective HCR and higher level outcomes. The first decade of
   dedicated HCR research led to the growth of distinct research streams
   and forged its own robust and growing literature. However, after a
   decade of progress, the field is splintered. To unite the field and
   create a solid foundation for building future research, we provide a
   cohesive perspective of lessons learned in the first decade of dedicated
   HCR research, which has primarily focused on collective HCR. This review
   examines 194 articles, revealing several themes that have emerged, an
   integrated model that flows from the review, and rich opportunities for
   future research to both integrate and expand the growing HCR field for
   the next decade and beyond.},

   Accuracy},

Abstract = {Decades of research suggest that information exchange in groups and
   organizations can reliably improve judgment accuracy in tasks such as
   financial forecasting, market research, and medical decision making.
   However, we show that improving the accuracy of numeric estimates does
   not necessarily improve the accuracy of decisions. For binary-choice
   judgments, also known as classification tasks???for example, yes/no or
   build/buy decisions???social influence is most likely to grow the
   majority vote share, regardless of the accuracy of that opinion. As a
   result, initially, inaccurate groups become increasingly inaccurate
   after information exchange, even as they signal stronger support. We
   term this dynamic the ???crowd classification problem.??? Using both a
   novel data set and a reanalysis of three previous data sets, we study
   this process in two types of information exchange: (1) when people share
   votes only, and (2) when people form and exchange numeric estimates
   prior to voting. Surprisingly, when people exchange numeric estimates
   prior to voting, the binary-choice vote can become less accurate, even
   as the average numeric estimate becomes more accurate. Our findings
   recommend against voting as a form of decision making when groups are
   optimizing for accuracy. For those cases where voting is required, we
   discuss strategies for managing communication to avoid the crowd
   classification problem. We close with a discussion of how our results
   contribute to a broader contingency theory of collective intelligence.},

   vs. tactical) and describe their impacts on various financial
   performance metrics (e.g., stock returns, Tobin's q), emphasizing key
   mediators and moderators influencing the process. We then utilize this
   framework to identify gaps or ambiguities in prior research findings and
   suggest research questions to help advance our understanding of the

Abstract = {In an increasingly fast-paced work environment filled with distractions,
   an over-abundance of information, and complex decision making, scholars
   and practitioners alike have begun to recognize the need to slow down
   and direct attention to the present moment. As such, the study and
   implementation of mindfulness in the workplace has received growing
   attention in recent years. This body of work, however, is preoccupied
   with the outcomes of individual- and collective-level mindfulness,
   largely ignoring mindfulness as brought into workplace interactions and
   relationships. In this study, we take a qualitative, grounded theory
   approach wherein we put forth and unpack a model of interpersonal
   mindfulness infusion: the process whereby individuals instill their
   mindfulness into their workplace interactions and relationships. We
   further distinguish between formal and informal and self- and
   other-focused mindfulness practices. We show how these practices
   underlie the mindfulness infusion process and can enhance workplace
   interactions and relationships. In doing so, we contribute to the
   organizational literature on mindfulness and positive relationships at
   work.},

Title = {Too Good to Be True? Are Supervisor-Perspective Ratings a Valid
   Substitute for Actual Supervisor Ratings?},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF APPLIED PSYCHOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {108},
Number = {1},
Pages = {167-178},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Due to well-known problems with self-ratings of job performance (e.g.,
   inflation, weak correlation with supervisor ratings) and the challenges
   of collecting supervisor ratings of job performance, researchers
   sometimes use supervisor-perspective ratings (e.g., ``how do you think
   your supervisor would rate your job performance?{''}) instead. The
   assumption is supervisor-perspective ratings are less affected by the
   noted issues with self-ratings and therefore are more similar to actual
   supervisor ratings than traditional self-ratings. In fact, a
   considerable number of researchers have used supervisor-perspective
   ratings as an alternative to actual supervisor ratings. The purpose of
   this study is to meta-analytically determine the degree to which
   supervisor-perspective ratings are a valid substitute for actual
   supervisor ratings and identify the boundary conditions for this
   substitution. Our meta-analyses demonstrate that supervisor-perspective
   ratings are generally not a viable substitute for actual supervisor
   ratings. This is especially the case when (a) citizenship performance is
   measured, (b) data are collected in collectivistic cultures, and (c) all
   study data are gathered from the same source. We recommend not using
   supervisor-perspective ratings as a substitute for actual supervisor
   ratings.},

Journal = {REVIEW OF ACCOUNTING STUDIES},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {28},
Number = {4},
Pages = {2196-2232},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {We investigate regulatory actions in response to violations of mandatory
   derivatives disclosure rules (SFAS 161) and the outcomes of these
   regulatory interventions using a hand-collected sample of derivatives
   disclosures. Derivatives are used by nearly two-thirds of U.S.
   nonfinancial firms, and they are one of the most complex types of
   financial contracts. Consequently, inadequate derivatives disclosures
   could pose significant challenges to financial statement users in
   assessing the risk and financial health of enterprises. First, we
   document that firms with high proprietary and agency costs are less
   likely to comply with SFAS 161. Next, by examining derivatives-related
   SEC comment letters, we further show that this noncompliance
   significantly increases the likelihood of receiving a comment letter. We
   also find that comment letter resolution is longer for firms with strong
   proprietary motivations than for those with strong agency incentives.
   Finally, we find that compliance with regard to derivatives disclosures
   following comment letter resolution improves for firms with high agency
   costs but not for firms with high proprietary costs. Collectively, our
   results imply that, when derivatives-related proprietary costs are high,
   benefits of noncompliance likely outweigh the costs. Moreover, the SEC's
   review effectiveness depends crucially on whether firms' initial
   motivation for noncompliance is proprietary versus agency.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ETHICS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {183},
Number = {1},

Abstract = {We adopt and extend the concept of `noncooperative space' to analyze how
   (aspirant) black women intellectual activists attempt to sustain their
   efforts within settings that publicly endorse racial equality, while, in
   practice, the contexts remain deeply racist. Noncooperative spaces
   reflect institutional, organizational, and social environments portrayed
   by powerful white agents as conducive to anti-racism work and promoting
   racial equality but, indeed, constrain individuals who challenge racism.
   Our work, which is grounded in intersectionality, draws on an
   autoethnographic account of racially motivated domestic violence
   suffered by our lead author. Our analysis suggests that (aspirant) black
   women intellectual activists must develop courage to sustain their
   `voice' within noncooperative spaces. However, the three interlinked
   dimensions of noncooperative spaces-namely, deceiving design, hegemonic
   actors' indifference to racism, and (some assimilated gatekeepers')
   false equivalence-may gradually erode a black female scholar's courage.
   This forces her `voice' to vanish temporarily, or even permanently.
   Courage is thus fragile and depletable. Yet, courage can be regenerated,
   resulting in regaining voice. Consequently, we propose courageous
   collective action by white allies and black and brown individuals who
   voluntarily and officially cooperate within and across various spaces to
   achieve racial equality.},

Title = {How Does Intelligent System Knowledge Empowerment Yield Payoffs?
   Uncovering the Adaptation Mechanisms and Contingency Role of Work
   Experience},
Journal = {INFORMATION SYSTEMS RESEARCH},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 APR 14},
Abstract = {Intelligent systems (IntelSys) are transforming the nature of work as
   humans and machines collectively perform tasks in novel ways. Although
   intelligent systems empower employees with algorithm-generated
   knowledge, they require employees to adapt how they work to enhance
   their job performance. We draw on the coping-adaptation framework as the
   overarching theoretical lens to explain how employees' perceptions of
   IntelSys knowledge as an empowering external coping resource affect the
   mechanisms through which they adapt to IntelSys-induced changes to their
   work, as well as how their internal coping resources regulate their
   adaptation. Our coping-adaptation explanation of intelligence
   augmentation integrates (i) the empowering role of external coping
   resources, specifically IntelSys knowledge, captured as intelligent
   system knowledge empowerment (ISK-Emp); (ii) the benefit-maximizing
   adaptation mechanism (through infusion use enhancement) and the
   disturbance-minimizing adaptation mechanism (through role conflict
   reduction) that channel the impact of ISK-Emp on job performance; and
   (iii) the regulating role of internal resources, specifically,
   employees' work experience, in influencing the importance of the
   adaptation mechanisms for the employee. We conduct studies in three
   distinct settings in which different intelligent systems were
   implemented to support employees' knowledge work. Our findings show that
   ISK-Emp increases job performance through each of the two adaptation
   mechanisms. The benefit-maximization mechanism (via enhanced infusion
   use) plays a more important role for novice employees than for
   experienced employees, whereas the disturbance-minimization mechanism
   (via reduced role conflict) has higher importance for experienced
   employees than for novice employees. Our work provides insights into the
   critical role of adaptation mechanisms in linking ISK-Emp with
   performance outcomes and into the relative importance of the adaptation
   mechanisms through which job performance payoffs are realized by novice
   and experienced employees.},

Title = {When Does the Pre-entry Experience of New Entrants Improve Their

Journal = {ORGANIZATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {34},
Number = {2},
Pages = {613-636},
Month = {MAR-APR},
Abstract = {Although pre-entry experience is widely regarded as a critical asset
   that positively influences new entrant performance, empirical support is
   mixed. To address this inconsistency, we conduct a meta-analysis of the
   empirical findings in 272 papers. We draw theoretically on the
   organizational learning literature to argue that the pre-entry
   experience-new entrant performance relationship is contingent on the
   characteristics of pre-entry experience, the environmental context of
   the new entrant, and the interaction between the two. In particular, we
   examine the effects of two levels of pre-entry experience (firmand
   founder), four types of founder-level pre-entry experience
   (entrepreneurial, managerial, industry, and functional experience), and
   two types of environments (industry and institutional). The
   meta-analysis results show a significant and positive correlation
   between founder-level pre-entry experience and economic performance of
   0.07. Likewise, the failure rates of spinouts and diversifying entrants
   are 11\% lower than that of start-ups. Themoderating analysis results
   show that the correlation of founder-level pre-entry experience and
   economic performance is lower in knowledge- or technology-intensive
   (KTI) industries and higher in low-KTI manufacturing and service
   industries. The correlation is also higher in institutional environments
   with high power distance and individualism. These findings provide
   compelling new evidence for the importance of pre-entry experience and
   advance our understanding of the boundary conditions on the pre-entry
   experience-new entrant performance relationship.},

Title = {The Ethics of Organizational Ethics},
Journal = {ORGANIZATION STUDIES},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {44},
Number = {3},
Pages = {497-514},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {This Perspectives article reviews research on organizational ethics
   presented in a select group of articles from Organization Studies, each
   of which draws inspiration, directly or indirectly, from the ethical
   philosophy of Emmanuel Levinas. This work is commended for how it has
   wrestled the locus of ethicality away from organizational authority and
   instead examined ethics in relation to the actions and interactions of
   those subject to that authority. Collectively, these articles articulate
   organizational ethics as an affective, relational and embodied response
   to the needs of others. Such ethics motivates political engagement in
   resistance to oppression and domination meted out by organizational
   authority. Acknowledging the significance of this contribution, the
   present article examines how the research reviewed is remiss for its
   latent humanism and the attendant risk of assuming that the actions of
   individual ethical subjects are morally superior to organized forms of
   ethics. The source of this ethical privileging of individual subjects
   comes from a failure to distinguish between the practice of ethics in
   organizations and the originary ethics of ethics. Following Levinas, the
   latter is understood as the passive and pre-subjective call to
   responsibility for the other with whom one is organized and that
   precedes any concrete proposal for an organizational ethics. By
   acknowledging the ethics of ethics, we see that affective, interpersonal
   ethics and more formally organized ethics can both be translations of
   the ethics of ethics, each being necessarily imperfect. The tension
   between authoritative and interpersonal forms of ethics in organizations
   is not a problem for ethics, but rather a condition of the possibility
   of organizational ethics itself.},

Number = {10, SI},

Abstract = {How do women's business networks help to advance women's freedom?
   Drawing on Zerilli's freedom-centred feminism, our study sets out to
   answer this question at the intersection of freedom, feminism and work.
   Critics argue that women's business networks promote a postfeminist view
   of freedom focusing on individual self-realisation and thus participate
   in rolling back collective, feminist efforts to dismantle structural
   inequalities. We reconceptualise women's business networks as political
   arenas and argue that making claims about shared interests and concerns
   in such an arena constitutes a feminist practice of freedom. With an
   original, inductive and qualitative research design combining topic
   modeling and dialectical analysis, we examine the claims made in 1529
   posts across four women's business network blogs. We identify
   postfeminist claims and new forms of change and transformation that can
   help to advance women's freedom across three `dialectics of freedom':
   conformity and imagination; performative care and relational care;
   sameness and openness. Our findings show that uncertain and
   contradictory ways of defining and engaging with women's freedom can
   emerge through claim-making in such arenas. The fragility of the process
   and its outcomes are, then, what can move feminism forward at work and
   beyond.},

Abstract = {Capitalism works when actors are motivated to engage in joint value
   creation. Stakeholder theorists have long argued that this is most
   likely when firms ``manage for stakeholders,{''} but have only recently
   explicitly recognized that stakeholders engaged in joint value creation
   face collective action problems: situations in which stakeholders may be
   tempted to pursue their own interest at the expense of maximizing joint
   value creation. We build on the work of Elinor Ostrom on solving
   collective action problems to develop theory about how to govern joint
   value creation whenmanaging for stakeholders. Specifically, we
   useOstrom's design principles to contrast the hub-and-spoke formof
   governance central tomuch of the stakeholder literature with two
   alternative governance forms (lead role governance and shared
   governance) that we derive from Ostrom's work, and we discuss the
   comparative effectiveness of these three governance forms as depending
   on the nature of the joint value creation activities. Ourwork
   contributes to stakeholder theory as an integrative perspective on the
   role ofmanagement and governance in fostering cooperation inmodern
   capitalist systems, where joint value creation increasingly involves
   stakeholders outside the boundaries of the firmas traditionally

Abstract = {Organizational change research has concentrated on the challenges of
   implementing isolated changes, paying little attention to the
   interactions among concurrent change initiatives. Our longitudinal
   real-time study of a multinational technology firm examines how two
   corporate change initiatives interfered with each other. The interfering
   initiatives provoked inconsistency judgments (cognitive, normative, and
   procedural) and the emergence of collective emotions that undermined
   change performance. Top managers' responses fueled the sharing of
   inconsistency judgments and emotions that fed into a recursive process
   that, over time, provoked emotional uncertainty, elicited moral
   emotions, and eroded emotional attachment to change. Our process model
   reveals inconsistency judgments as a previously overlooked
   socio-psychological mechanism underpinning interferences between change
   initiatives. We reveal the limitations of examining organizational
   change in terms of isolated initiatives and call for research that

Volume = {65},

Abstract = {Past research has produced contradictory insights into how prior
   collaboration between organizations-their relational
   embeddedness-impacts collective collaborative performance. We theorize
   that the effect of relational embeddedness on collaborative success is
   contingent on the type of success under consideration, and we develop a
   typology of two kinds of success. We test our hypotheses using data from
   Crunchbase on a sample of almost 11,000 U.S. start-ups backed by
   venture-capital (VC) firms, using the VCs' previous collaborative
   experience to predict the type of success that the start-ups will
   experience. Our findings indicate that as prior collaborative experience
   within a group of VCs increases, a jointly funded start-up is more
   likely to exit by acquisition (which we call a focused success); with
   less prior experience among the group of VCs, a jointly funded start-up
   is more likely to exit by initial public offering (a broadcast success).
   Our results deepen understanding of the connections between
   organizational performance and collaboration networks, contributing to
   entrepreneurship research on the role of investors in technology
   ventures.},

Abstract = {Return on investment (ROI) and residual income (RI) are two important
   accounting measures that are commonly used to evaluate managers'
   performance, and evidence suggests that both ROI and RI can help
   motivate long-term investments. Research is limited, though, regarding
   whether ROI and RI differentially affect managers' actions, and, more
   specifically, research has not examined the effects of ROI and RI on
   risk-taking. We conduct an experiment to examine the separate and
   interactive effects of individuals' risk preferences and ROI and RI
   performance measures on risk-taking in capital investment decisions. We
   predict and find that the use of ROI as a performance measure leads to
   riskier choices, as compared with RI, and that this effect is
   concentrated in relatively more risk-averse individuals. We also provide
   process evidence that reveals some of the ways in which ROI and RI
   performance measures affect decision making. Collectively, our results
   contribute to literature examining the effects of accounting information
   and performance measures on managers' risk-taking behaviors.},

Title = {Emphasizing ``me{''} or ``we{''}: Training framing and self-concept in

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {This study explores how the motivational framing of a network training
   program may positively or (inadvertently) adversely impact participants'
   discomfort with strategic networking and motivation to network. We
   examine the impact of a ``me-focused{''} framing (i.e., on the personal
   career benefits that individuals can accrue through strategic
   networking) and a ``we-focused{''} framing (i.e., on the benefits to the
   team/organization of individuals' strategic networking) compared to a
   control group in two field-based quasi-experiments. In both studies, we
   found no difference between the two training frames in their effect on
   the two training outcomes when looking at participants' reactions, on
   average. However, in the second study, we find that individual
   differences in the way participants relate to others (i.e., the extent
   to which they endorse an individual or a collective self-concept) change
   the impact of the framing on their discomfort with and motivation to
   network. The findings highlight the importance of considering the match
   or mismatch between training framing and self-concept. In the we-focused
   condition, a match was related to decreased networking discomfort, while
   a mismatch was related to increased discomfort and decreased motivation.
   In the me-focused condition, a mismatch was counter-intuitively related
   to decreased discomfort. These findings suggest that considering
   participants' reactions to training (i.e., change in discomfort and
   motivation), on average, may mask important differences in their
   response to network-based training and that tailoring network training
   to participants' self-concepts may be an important consideration for
   human resource management professionals.},

Title = {(Overcoming) Maternity Bias in the Workplace: A Systematic Review},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {49},
Number = {1},
Pages = {52-84},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Maternity, a period of transition beginning with prenatal bodily changes
   and progressing through postnatal lactation, is experienced by up to
   66\% of working women. Over the past several decades, research on
   maternity in the workplace has grown exponentially to reveal salient
   maternity biases that plague women as they navigate their employee and
   motherhood identities. With the aim of providing information that aids
   scholars and practitioners in better understanding the experiences of
   working mothers, we conducted a systematic review of 239 papers on
   maternity bias (i.e., formal, interpersonal, and internalized). Our
   interdisciplinary review discusses these three forms of bias and how
   they might present across different career stages for working mothers.
   Additionally, we review the antecedents that may drive maternity bias
   and the outcomes that result for working mothers who perceive or
   anticipate bias at work. Finally, we discuss areas of previous research
   aimed at overcoming maternity bias from the perspective of working
   mothers, their colleagues, and their organization. We conclude by
   discussing the trends brought to light in our review, the collective
   strengths and weaknesses of commonly adopted theoretical perspectives of
   the research reviewed, implications for combating maternity bias for
   women and their organizations, and recommendations for future research.
   Our model of maternity bias comprehensively reviews past work to provide
   insights into the bias that working mothers endure at work but also
   provides a path forward, as better understanding these biases empower
   organizations, coworkers, and employees to remediate maternity bias.},

Title = {Setting the Stage for Success: How Participation Diversity Can Help

Journal = {JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {49},
Number = {4},
Pages = {1312-1343},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Though we know racioethnic diversity can impact team functioning, much
   remains unclear about when and how it affects performance. Extending
   dyadic theory on interracial interactions, we develop and test
   predictions about how participation diversity (i.e., the distribution of
   team member temporal involvement in task functions) influences the
   racioethnic diversity-performance relationship. We theorize that
   racioethnic diversity is motivational, prompting self-enhancement goals
   that are best achieved via cooperation, but are impeded by anxiety that
   often accompanies racioethnic dissimilarity. Heightened participation
   diversity provides structure (by clarifying behavioral scripts) that
   should reduce interracial anxiety, thereby resulting in positive effects
   of racioethnic diversity on performance through cooperation. Such
   performance benefits of racioethnic diversity are lower in likelihood in
   less structured interracial, work-related encounters. Results from a
   field study and two archival datasets indicated that when there are more
   clearly differentiated temporal roles, greater racioethnic diversity
   corresponded with higher performance. Cooperation helped to account for
   this relationship, as greater differentiation facilitated the positive
   effect of racioethnic diversity on cooperation, thereby enhancing team
   performance. This relationship is significantly smaller or
   nonsignificant when participation diversity is lower. Collectively, our
   theory and results help to reconcile prior inconsistent effects of
   racioethnic diversity on team performance.},

Title = {What (Exactly) Is Novelty in Networks? Unpacking the Vision Advantages
   of Brokers, Bridges, and Weak Ties},
Journal = {MANAGEMENT SCIENCE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {69},
Number = {2},
Pages = {1092-1115},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The strength of weak ties and brokerage theory both rely on the argument
   that weak bridging ties deliver novel information to create ``vision
   advantages{''} for actors in brokerage positions. However, our
   conceptualization of novelty is itself fundamentally underdeveloped. We,
   therefore, develop a theory of how three distinct types of
   novelty-diversity, non-redundancy, and uniqueness-combine with network
   structure to create vision advantages in social networks. We test this
   theory using panel data on an evolving corporate email network. Three
   main results emerge from our analysis. First, we confirm the
   diversity-bandwidth tradeoff (DBT) at the heart of the vision advantage.
   As brokers' networks become more diverse, their channel bandwidth
   contracts, creating countervailing effects on access to novel
   information. Second, we uncover a mechanism driving the DBT, which helps
   explain differences in vision advantages across strong and weak ties.
   Strong, cohesive ties deliver greater information diversity and
   non-redundancy, whereas weak bridging ties contribute the most unique
   information (the information that is most different from what other
   contacts deliver). Third, we find network diversity (in contrast to
   network constraint) to be positively associated with longitudinal
   entropy, a measure of the accumulation of novel information over time.
   This suggests that weak bridging ties, which provide the most unique
   information through low bandwidth, structurally diverse channels,
   contribute the most to one's aggregation of novel information over time.
   Collectively, these results take a step toward resolving a long-standing
   debate in network theory about whether strong, cohesive networks or weak
   bridging networks contribute more to vision advantages. This work firmly
   establishes that it depends.},

Abstract = {We offer novel evidence on how the nature of brokerage-client
   relationships can influence the quality of equity research. We exploit a
   unique setting provided by the Protocol for Broker Recruiting to examine
   whether relaxed broker noncompete agreement enforcement generates
   spillover effects on sell-side analysts. Entry into this agreement
   reassigns ownership of the client relationship from the brokerage to
   individual brokers, potentially generating a greater standard of care.
   Using a generalized difference-in-differences research design, we
   provide evidence consistent with brokers reducing pressure on analysts
   to produce optimistic research following protocol entry. This effect is
   concentrated among less experienced and non-All Star analysts, who
   previously may have faced the greatest pressures to sacrifice
   objectivity. Additionally, we find that analysts issue more accurate
   forecasts and generate reports with heightened market reactions
   following protocol entry. Our collective evidence sheds new light on how
   the nature of brokerage relationships can influence analysts' research

   contextualized framework of SME innovation that considers gendered
   effects in ownership, workforce composition, and communication. Findings
   indicate that in emerging markets, female-led SMEs employ more women
   than male-led SMEs, and more women in SMEs (even at modest levels)
   enhance and enable the TM system to deliver more innovation outcomes.
   Findings also suggest that emerging-market SMEs can be innovative
   through differing configurations of women in ownership and workforce
   composition, underscoring the importance of gendered and contextual
   considerations in innovation research. Managerial Summary Innovation is
   vital to the social progress and economic development of emerging
   markets. Even though institutionalized gender bias in emerging markets
   tends to constrain (rather than empower) women's entrepreneurial
   activities, our study reveals how women can be an important source of
   innovation. We find that women in emerging markets are stronger
   together: women in ownership advocate for and support other women by
   employing them in their SMEs, and in turn, as women's representation
   increases in SMEs, women are empowered to collectively share and
   leverage their endowed resources for innovation. Thus, our study
   challenges the general perception that men are more innovative than
   women by revealing that the presence of women in emerging-market SMEs
   yields greater innovation outcomes.},

Abstract = {Natural resource scarcity is giving rise to new forms of resource
   governance and so enhancing the transition to more sustainable resource
   use. One key development is the growth of circular economy systems,
   where residual resources are reused in closed-loop systems. This
   requires an understanding of how diverse actors collectively govern the
   sustainable use and sharing of privately owned residual and waste
   resources. Our empirical analysis of three circular economy systems in
   Finland, the United States and Spain shows how a polycentric form of
   governance develops through collective action between businesses, the
   public sector, and societal actors based on multiple units of
   cooperation. Adopting insights from the polycentric governance of
   commons, we develop a theory of polycentric governance for privately
   owned residual resources. Our findings show that polycentric governance
   involves three main interacting elements: mutual adjustment between
   actors, practices for collective agency, and structures for sharing
   resources. As well as contributing to the understanding of collective
   action for sustainability, these findings also advance the
   interorganizational governance literature.},

Journal = {ORGANIZATION STUDIES},

Volume = {43},

Abstract = {This article sheds light on how a group of workers manage to create an
   enduring collective resistance, in an uncongenial context of neoliberal
   management pushing for compliant behaviours. Research on resistance has
   given scant attention to the concrete conditions through which
   collective resisting efforts can be sustained, despite adverse contexts.
   We highlight the process through which everyday collective resistance
   produces substantial effects and becomes viewed by management and
   workers as an integral part of an organization's power relations. We
   particularly illuminate how practices that mutually constitute
   belongingness and insubordination continuously reinforce collective
   resistance to make it the very texture of workers' lives. We therefore
   analyse everyday resistance as a way of life, through which workers aim
   to simultaneously contest managerial authority and protect their own
   social boundaries in a neoliberal context. Thereby, we offer a way to
   reconcile recognition and post-recognition politics in a dialogue
   envisaging the `efficacy' of resistance in a new light.},

Title = {Relational Co-ordination and Stigma at Work: How Frontline Employees
   Compensate for Failures in Public Health Systems},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT STUDIES},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {61},
Number = {3},
Pages = {752-784},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Co-ordinating collective work and communicating a shared understanding
   of tasks is necessary to accomplishing organizational goals. Stigma
   could exacerbate co-ordination challenges between public and private
   organizations by further widening differences in goals and incentives
   among employees. Using relational co-ordination theory, we explore how
   stigma can influence employee behaviour in the context of healthcare
   delivery. We study healthcare professionals and frontline workers
   involved in the fight against AIDS in India to examine how public health
   systems fail due to a lack of communication and co-ordination, and that
   these failures are worsened by stigma. When stigma is present,
   relationships between employees become strained due to misaligned work
   routines, lack of information sharing and cooperation failure. Our
   findings reveal emergent responses from frontline employees that
   mitigate co-ordination failures through: (1) role adaptation to improve
   predictability of tasks; (2) social purpose identification to promote a
   common understanding and engage stigmatized clients; and (3) affective
   attachment that encourages extra-role behaviours and task ownership. We
   draw implications for relational co-ordination and stigma, as well as
   public-private co-ordination in public health systems.},

Title = {Learning in Temporary Teams: The Varying Effects of Partner Exposure by

Journal = {ORGANIZATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {34},
Number = {1},
Pages = {433-455},
Month = {JAN-FEB},
Abstract = {In many workplaces, temporary teams convene to coordinate complex work,
   despite team members having not worked together before. Most related
   research has found consistent performance benefits when members of
   temporary teams work together multiple times (team familiarity). Recent
   work in this area broke new conceptual ground by instead exploring the
   learning and performance benefits that team members gain by being
   exposed to many new partners (partner exposure). In contrast to that new
   work that examined partner exposure between team members who are peers,
   in this paper, we extend this research by developing and testing theory
   about the performance effects of partner exposure for team members whose
   roles are differentiated by authority and skill. We use visitlevel data
   from a hospital emergency department and leverage the ad hoc assignment
   of attendings, nurses, and residents to teams and the round-robin
   assignment of patients to these teams as our identification strategy. We
   find a negative performance effect of both nurses' and resident
   trainees' partner exposure to more attendings and of attendings' and
   nurses' exposure to more residents. In contrast, both attendings and
   residents experience a positive impact on performance from working with
   more nurses. The respective effects of residents working with more
   attendings and with more nurses is attenuated on patient cases with more
   structured workflows. Our results suggest that interactions with team
   members in decision-executing roles, as opposed to decision-initiating
   roles, is an important but often unrecognized part of disciplinary
   training and team learning.},

   mistakes in developing and publishing papers that offer a methodological
   contribution. In doing so, we consider works whose methodological

Title = {Balancing Work and Family: A Theoretical Explanation and Longitudinal
   Examination of Its Relation to Spillover and Role Functioning},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF APPLIED PSYCHOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {107},
Number = {7},
Pages = {1094-1114},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {We take a temporally dynamic perspective to present a model that
   explains the relations among work-family spillover (conflict and
   enrichment), work-family balance, and role satisfaction and performance
   over time. We posit that these relationships differ for two primary
   conceptualizations, balance satisfaction and effectiveness. We collect
   data using two samples, each with three time points. In Study 1 (N =
   681), we test our hypotheses for balance satisfaction. Cross-lagged
   analyses indicated that bidirectional enrichment predicted subsequent
   job and family satisfaction, and in turn, balance satisfaction. Thus,
   enrichment appears to primarily initiate the balance satisfaction
   process as it unfolds over time. Contrary to common theoretical and
   practical assumptions, role satisfaction seems to drive balance
   satisfaction rather than the other way around. In Study 2 (N = 493), we
   test our hypotheses for balance satisfaction and balance effectiveness.
   Cross-lagged analyses indicated that conflict primarily initiated the
   balance effectiveness process where role performance and balance
   effectiveness operated in feedback cycles of mutual influence over time.
   Posthoc model tests are consistent with Study 1 in that work-to-family
   enrichment predicted job satisfaction and in turn, balance satisfaction.
   Collectively, these studies suggest that the processes involving balance
   satisfaction versus balance effectiveness have different primary
   originating factors (enrichment or conflict, respectfully) and different
   temporal sequencing with role satisfaction and performance
   (unidirectional vs. reciprocal, respectively), warranting distinct
   theoretical explanations. This program of research represents a
   comprehensive, theoretical explanation and temporal examination of
   work-family balance, setting the stage for a new phase of research.},

Abstract = {This study addresses the gap between policy and practice on the issue of
   women's right to own rural land through a qualitative study conducted in
   Pakistan's two largest provinces, Punjab and Sindh. A recent survey
   finds that only 4\% of women own rural land in Pakistan. Given the
   relatively large agrarian economy, land is a key resource determining
   women's agency. To understand the dynamics that maintain this status
   quo, I use two distinct strands of feminist theory. First is Joan
   Acker's organizational theory of gender and class structures, to explore
   the inequality regimes embedded in rural patriarchy. Second, I adapt
   Suad Joseph's conceptualization of patriarchal connectivity to show how
   in rural Pakistan, valorizing kinship works to exclude women from
   matters pertaining to land and silencing demands for their inheritances.
   This framework simultaneously allows for a fine-grained analysis of the
   politico-economic and social structures of rural society, while building
   an intimate understanding of familial relations. The findings show how
   land is discursively defined as a collective good to ensure that landed
   patriarchs remain entrenched within the political and economic order of
   the state, limiting possibilities, for women, of acquiring agency
   through owning and controlling rural land. The study also upends the
   widespread myth of Islamic misogyny, for it demonstrates the political
   economy of patriarchal domination over religion in Pakistan.},

Abstract = {International joint ventures (IJVs) have become an important source of
   critical knowledge for multinational enterprises, but little is known
   about how knowledge can be effectively transferred to parent firms when
   the potential for interpartner opportunism still exists. Drawing on
   attachment theory, we study how boundary-spanning commitments to IJVs
   may help mitigate interpartner opportunism and facilitate effective
   knowledge transfer to parents. Specifically, we argue that knowledge
   transfer from IJVs to their parents is positively mediated by both
   boundary spanners' organizational commitment to IJVs and parent firms'
   resource commitment to IJVs. We test our arguments using survey data
   collected from 600 dyadic Chinese-foreign managers of 100 IJVs
   established in China. The results provide evidence that knowledge
   sharing between boundary spanners in IJVs positively affects their
   organizational commitment to these IJVs, which in turn positively
   affects knowledge transfer to parents. Similarly, knowledge sharing
   between such boundary spanners positively affects parent firms' resource
   commitment to IJVs, which in turn positively affects knowledge transfer
   to parents. The mediating role of boundary spanners' organizational
   commitment is stronger than that of parent firms' resource commitment.
   Collectively, our findings suggest that commitment-based relational
   mechanisms are imperative for safeguarding effective knowledge transfer
   from IJVs to parent firms.},

Abstract = {This paper focuses on the experiences of self-identified fat women
   employees. Combining the works of Karen Barad and Sara Ahmed, we offer a
   feminist new materialist analysis of the production of difference in
   organizations related to size as an entanglement of bodies, discourses,
   organizational materials and affect. We show how our participants
   predominantly became shameful and a `bad fit' within their jobs through
   the intra-action of their large bodies with obesity discourse and
   organizational materials such as chairs and workwear. Yet we also
   illustrate how some material-discursive entanglements offered situations
   where shame was circumvented, instead producing our participants as
   acceptable within their organizational context. Our research contributes
   to discussions on embodied normativities in organizations by taking
   these issues beyond the discursive realm and highlighting the importance
   of materiality and affect in `fitting in' at work. We offer new
   theoretical pathways to explore differentiating practices by looking at
   shame as part of collective and affective histories of marginalization.},

Title = {When States Build Markets: Policy support as a double-edged sword in the
   UK social investment market},
Journal = {ORGANIZATION STUDIES},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {44},
Number = {2},
Pages = {229-252},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Markets are the outcomes of political and institutional struggles where
   policy support plays a major role, but research to date falls short in
   explaining how the breadth of available interventions can have
   contradictory effects on the process of market formation. This article
   explores the consequences of policy support in the context of the
   nascent social investment market in the United Kingdom, between 2000 and
   2015, when the government was a key actor in building the market
   infrastructure. I track the effects of a portfolio of policy
   interventions, including new regulation, direct investment and convening
   efforts. I show that, while policy support stimulated the market by
   driving supply and intermediation, it also led to an increase in
   contestation from the social sector. I link those intended and
   unintended consequences to the top-down features of the policy support
   (supporting the dominant logic, reinforcing hierarchical relations and
   optimistic rhetoric), hence showing when and how policy support can
   become a double-edged sword. The article contributes to the literature
   on policy support in market formation by showing the mechanisms through
   which top-down policy interventions can have important unintended
   consequences, especially when shaping the boundaries and features of
   markets that emerge at the intersection of financial and social sectors.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF APPLIED PSYCHOLOGY},

Volume = {107},
Number = {4},

Abstract = {The use of variable work schedules (VWS)-altering the number and timing
   of employees' work hours on a daily or weekly basis-is an increasingly
   common human resource (HR) practice designed to increase staffing
   flexibility. Little research, however, has examined whether and how the
   use of VWS affects an organization's turnover rates and/or financial
   performance at the unit level. Despite the common assumption that their
   use helps firms achieve higher performance by matching the supply of
   labor to demand fluctuations-especially during a crisis such as
   coronavirus disease (COVID-19)-this study demonstrates otherwise. I
   propose that greater use of variable schedules can lead to higher
   turnover rates and that this effect has been more pronounced during the
   pandemic. I also argue that managerial reliance on VWS can decrease not
   only the level of financial performance but also performance recovery
   during the pandemic-with unit-level turnover as the mediating mechanism.
   Using data from 1,678 units of a U.S. 4 quick-service restaurant chain
   across different phases of the COVID-19 pandemic (October 2019-December
   2020), I find support for these predictions. Results suggest that
   scholars and practitioners should reconsider the general assumption that
   staffing flexibility helps organizations adapt to uncertain
   environments.},

Abstract = {We use a lab experiment to examine whether and how leaders influence
   workers' (un)ethical behavior through financial reporting choices. We
   randomly assign the role of leaders or workers to subjects, who can
   choose to report an outcome via automatic or self-reporting.
   Self-reporting allows for profitable and undetectable earnings
   manipulation. We vary the leaders' ability to choose the reporting
   method and to punish workers. We show that workers are more likely to
   choose automatic reporting when their leader voluntarily does so and can
   assign punishment. Even workers who choose self-reporting tend to cheat
   less when their leader chooses automatic reporting. Nonetheless, most
   leaders do not opt for automatic reporting in the first place: they
   often choose self-reporting and punish workers who rather choose
   automatic reporting. Collectively, our results reveal a dual effect of
   leadership on ethical behaviors in organizations: workers behave more
   ethically if their leader makes ethical choices, but often leaders do
   not make ethical choices in the first place. Hence, leading by example
   can backfire.},

Abstract = {We examine whether politically connected firms play a role in

   campaign financing activity or the presence of a government affairs
   office to proxy for firms' access to political information, we find that
   politically connected firms are more likely to issue management
   guidance, and their guidance is more likely to discuss government
   policies. Further, these relations are attenuated for firms facing high
   proprietary costs of disclosure. To provide evidence on the source of
   the political information disclosed through guidance, we examine the
   timing of when guidance is issued. We find that politically connected
   firms are more likely to issue guidance and change their government
   policy-related disclosures prior to the public revelation of government
   policy decisions. Collectively, these findings suggest that the
   privileged information firms obtain through their political connections
   is shared with investors through voluntary disclosures.},

Volume = {59},

Abstract = {In many sectors of the entertainment industry, a few employees attract
   the public spotlight when performing the core service. For example, in
   professional team sports, a team of players competes in games, and in TV
   shows, a cast of artists acts in different episodes. These employees,
   coined ``spotlight personnel,{''} are an essential but expensive element
   of ongoing service delivery. Despite their importance and cost, very
   little is known about how changes in spotlight personnel affect service
   performance and demand. To address this gap, this article uses unique
   data on professional German soccer teams, tracking the quantity (number
   of players) and quality (average transfer price) of spotlight personnel
   hiring (incoming transfers) and turnover (outgoing transfers), objective
   service performance (winning percentage), and demand (ticket sales)
   across four decades, using both traditional and novel time series
   methods. The results show that service performance and demand are
   primarily affected by spotlight personnel hiring rather than by
   turnover. Hiring quantity decreases service performance yet increases
   demand, whereas hiring quality benefits both service performance and
   demand. The analysis further uncovers that these effects are subject to
   dynamic interactions and nonlinearities. Investment scenarios showcase
   how understanding these effects can substantially improve managerial
   decision making.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we examine whether a regulatory shift allowing more
   private firm disclosure leads to less myopia. The Jumpstart Our Business
   Startups (JOBS) Act of 2012 permits a subset of firms to meet privately
   with potential investors in the months before an IPO, allowing them to
   provide information without proprietary cost concerns, leading to more
   complete disclosure. Consistent with a reduction in myopia, we find that
   these firms are less likely to manage earnings to beat short-term
   benchmarks, are punished less harshly by the market (via stock price
   declines) when they do miss the earnings benchmark, and provide fewer
   short-horizon forecasts. We also find that firm disclosures are less
   short-term focused, investors have longer holding periods than do those
   same investors in non-JOBS Act IPO firms and that these firms attract
   more long-term investors. Our results hold (i) across the subsample of
   firms for which other JOBS Act provisions were already present, and (ii)
   after controlling for those other provisions, consistent with private
   discussions acting as the primary mechanism. Our results are also
   strongest for firms with higher proprietary costs, consistent with
   private disclosure reducing myopia by reducing proprietary cost
   concerns. Collectively, this evidence suggests that when firms are able
   to privately disclose information to investors, both firms and investors
   become less myopic.},

   Quality},

Volume = {68},

Abstract = {This study examines the relation between financial reporting quality
   (FRQ) and eponymy, that is, naming a firm after the founder. We
   hypothesize that compared with noneponymous firms, eponymous firms have
   higher FRQ because of reputation concerns. Using a sample of 2,271 large
   Italian private firms, we document that eponymy is positively associated
   with accrual-based FRQ measures, a Benford's law-based FRQ measure, and
   a tax-related misstatement-based FRQ measure. Consistent with the
   reputation concern rationale, we find that the positive association
   between eponymy and FRQ is attributable to eponymous firms that have
   rarer names or receive more press coverage. Furthermore, the positive
   association between FRQ and eponymy is similar whether the top
   executives/board members belong to the founding family's first or later
   generations. We also find that eponymous firms are more conditionally
   conservative. Collectively, the results suggest that reputation concerns
   act as a disciplining mechanism for FRQ in private firms.},

Abstract = {In today's environment characterized by business dynamism and
   information technology (IT)advances, firms must frequently update their
   enterprise information systems (EIS)and their use policies to support
   changing business operations. In this context, users are challenged to
   maintain EIS compliance behavior by continuously learning new ways of
   using EIS. Furthermore, it is imperative to businesses that employees of
   afunctional unit maintain EIS compliance behavior collectively, due tot
   he interdependent nature of tasks thatthe unit needs
   toaccomplishthroughEIS. However, it is particularly challengingtoachieve
   suchacollectivelevel ofEIScompliance, due tothe difficulty that these
   employees may encounter inquickly learningupdatedEIS. It is, therefore,
   vital for firms toestablisheffective managerial principles toensure
   collective EIScom-pliance of afunctional unit inadynamic environment.
   Toaddress this challenge,thisstudy develops aresearchmodel
   toexplaincollective EIScompliance by integratingtheoretical lensonsocial
   context andperformance management context withsocial capital theory. It
   proposes that social context, an organizationalenvironment
   characterizedby trust andsupport, positively affects collective
   EIScompliance by developingbusiness-IT socialcapital that enhances
   mutual learning betweenbusiness andIT personnel. Furthermore,the
   performance managementcontext, an organizational environment
   characterizedby discipline and ``stretch,{''} is seen to have adirect
   and beneficial effect onc ollectiveEIScompliance as well as an
   indirect,moderatingeffect on the causalchainamongsocialcontexts,
   business-IT social capital, and collective EIScompliance. General
   empirical support for this research model is provided
   viaamultiple-sourced survey of managers and employees of 159functional
   units of 53 firms that use EIS, as well as their corresponding IT unit
   managers. The theoretical and practical implications of these findings
   are discussed.},

Abstract = {We uncover fundamental dimensions of the process through which

   organizational journey in the direction of the common good. Building on
   the latest encyclical of Pope Francis, Fratelli Tutti, about fraternal
   and social friendship, we offer insight into the understanding of what
   it means to become a fraternal organization and reflect on the key
   ethical and paradoxical challenges for organizations aiming at
   collectively contributing to the common good. We add to previous work by
   characterizing this journey as a process involving unique ethical
   challenges that emerge from the paradoxes associated with this process
   and how this might change the nature of the relationships between
   organizations and others within the organizational landscape.},

Abstract = {We examine the consequences of a regulatory intervention aimed at
   generalizing tenure voting in French public companies. The 2014 Florange
   Act departs from the `one share one vote' principle by automatically
   granting double-voting rights (DVR) to shares held for at least two
   years. However, firms can opt out through an annual meeting vote. We
   document three main findings. First, firms that adopt DVR by default
   experience a decrease in long-term foreign institutional ownership
   offset by an increase in insider/family ownership. Second, those firms
   significantly underperform in terms of stock returns after Florange
   relative to those that reject DVR. Third, their environmental and social
   performance deteriorates. Collectively, our evidence casts doubt on the
   merit of regulation induced tenure voting as a desirable corporate
   governance mechanism.},

Year = {2023},
Volume = {28},

Pages = {385-420},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {We examine how research posted by ``social media analysts{''}
   (SMAs)-individuals posting equity research online via social media
   investment platforms-is related to research subsequently produced by
   professional sell-side equity analysts. Using data from Seeking Alpha,
   we find that the market reaction to sell-side analyst research is
   substantially reduced when the analyst research is preceded by the
   report of an SMA, and that this is particularly true of sell-side
   analysts' earnings forecasts. We further find that this effect is more
   pronounced when SMA reports contain more decision-useful language, are
   produced by SMAs with greater expertise, and relate to firms with
   greater retail investor ownership. We also provide evidence that the
   attenuated response to sell-side research is most likely explained by
   SMA research preempting information in sell-side research and that
   analysts respond to SMA preemption with bolder and more disaggregated
   forecasts. Collectively, our results suggest that equity research posted
   online by SMAs provides investors with information that is similar to
   but arrives earlier than sell-side equity research, and speak to the
   connected and evolving roles of information intermediaries in capital
   markets.},

   Freeze firms also increase their usage of CSR-related keywords in public
   disclosures following the freeze. We find a stronger CSR response to
   more severe freezes, to more controversial cash-balance conversions, and
   in larger sponsors. This is consistent with CSR increases being
   motivated by the need to repair one's reputation. We also find that CSR
   increases following an accounting rule change that makes pension
   deficits more visible. Collectively, our findings highlight an important
   driver of CSR: the need to restore or manage reputation, especially in
   the face of corporate actions that can hurt stakeholders.},

Title = {Deep Learning of Spatiotemporal Patterns for Urban Mobility Prediction
   Using Big Data},

Abstract = {Timely and accurate prediction of human movement in urban areas offers
   instructive insights into transportation management, public safety, and
   location-based services, to name a few. Yet, modeling urban mobility is
   challenging and complex because of the spatiotemporal dynamics of
   movement behavior and the influence of exogenous factors such as
   weather, holidays, and local events. In this paper, we use bus
   transportation as a proxy to mine spatiotemporal travel patterns. We
   propose a deep-learning-based urban mobility prediction model that
   collectively forecasts passenger flows between pairs of city regions in
   an origin-destination (OD) matrix. We first process OD matrices in a
   convolutional neural network to capture spatial correlations.
   Intermediate results are reconstructed into three multivariate time
   series: hourly, daily, and weekly time series. Each time series is
   aggregated in a long short-term memory (LSTM) network with a novel
   attention mechanism to guide the aggregation. In addition, our model is
   context-aware by using contextual embeddings learned from exogenous
   factors. We dynamically merge results from LSTM components and context
   embeddings in a late fusion network to make a final prediction. The
   proposed model is implemented and evaluated using a large-scale
   transportation data set of more than 200 million bus trips with a suite
   of Big Data technologies developed for data processing. Through
   performance comparison, we show that our approach achieves sizable
   accuracy improvements in urban mobility prediction. Our work has major
   implications for efficient transportation system design and performance
   improvement. The proposed deep neural network structure is generally
   applicable for sequential graph data prediction.},

Abstract = {How does cognitive diversity in a group affect its performance? Prior
   research suggests that group cognitive diversity poses a performance
   tradeoff: Diverse groups excel at creativity and innovation, but
   struggle to take coordinated action. Building on the insight that group
   cognition is not static, but is instead dynamically and interactively
   produced, we introduce the construct of discursive diversity, a
   manifestation of group cognitive diversity, which reflects the degree to
   which the meanings conveyed by group members in a given set of
   interactions diverge from one another. We propose that high-performing
   teams are ones that have a collective capacity to modulate shared
   cognition to match changing task requirements: They exhibit higher
   discursive diversity when engaged in ideational tasks and lower
   discursive diversity when performing coordination tasks. We further
   argue that teams exhibiting congruent modulation-that is, those with low
   group-level variance in members' within-person semantic shifts to
   changing task requirements-are more likely to experience success than
   teams characterized by incongruent modulation. Using the tools of
   computational linguistics to derive a measure of discursive diversity
   and drawing on a novel longitudinal data set of intragroup electronic
   communications and performance outcomes for 117 remote software
   development teams on an online platform (www.gigster.com), we find
   support for our theory. Our findings suggest that the performance
   tradeoff of group cognitive diversity is not inescapable: Groups can
   navigate it by aligning their levels of discursive diversity to match
   their task requirements and by having members stay aligned with one
   another as they make these adjustments.},

Abstract = {Irving Janis's concept of `groupthink', the idea that a collective
   desire for consensus overrides the realistic appraisals of alternatives
   and leads to poor group decision making, is a staple of social science
   textbooks. Despite gaining little support in empirical studies, Janis's
   eight symptoms of groupthink remains a popular framework. What has been
   forgotten, however, is that nearly 20 years before Janis's supposed
   invention, groupthink was coined by social critic William H Whyte,
   author of one of the 1950s, most influential books on management. Adding
   to the growing interest in a historical turn in Management and
   Organization Studies, we investigate how and why Whyte's groupthink was
   over-written by a history that found Janis's ideas more useful, and
   outline how recovering Whyte can add value to our thinking now.},

   quantitative performance},
Journal = {ORGANIZATIONAL BEHAVIOR AND HUMAN DECISION PROCESSES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {169},

Abstract = {There is a gender performance gap in the MBA classroom, in which men
   perform better than women, particularly in quantitative courses. We
   examined whether greater congruence between participants' self-construal
   levels and the self-affirmation in which they engaged would mitigate the
   gender performance gap. In Study 1, participants varying in their
   self-construal levels were randomly assigned to one of three conditions:
   1) an individual self affirmation condition in which they wrote about a
   value that is important to them, 2) a collective self affirmation
   condition in which they wrote about a value that is important to them
   and their ingroup, and 3) a control condition in which they wrote about
   a value important to someone else. We found that: 1) the gender
   performance gap was mitigated among those who individually self-affirmed
   and 2) the gender performance gap was particularly likely to be
   diminished under conditions of congruent self-affirmation (when those
   who were relatively high in independent self-construal engaged in
   individual self-affirmation and when those who were relatively high in
   interdependent self-construal engaged in collective self-affirmation).
   Conceptually analogous results emerged in Study 2 conducted on a
   considerably larger on-line sample. The discussion centers on: (1) the
   implications of our findings for the emerging literature on wise
   interventions, and (2) the practical value of encouraging individuals to
   engage in self-affirmation to counteract the harmful effects of
   stereotype-threat.},

Journal = {MANAGEMENT SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {68},
Number = {2},
Pages = {1149-1173},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Time preferences and risk preferences play an important role in a wide
   range of behavior, including financial decisions, entrepreneurship, and
   the proper incentivizing of agents. Numerous methods have been developed
   to measure these preferences hypothetically in surveys, but they have
   yielded inconsistent results. We analyze a panel data set in which
   subjects have collectively answered more than 400 surveys including 15
   time preference and 36 risk-preference elicitations. We evaluate the
   performance of these measures using the criteria of (1) ability to
   predict economically important behavior and (2) distinctness from other
   observables. We find substantial heterogeneity in the predictiveness of
   the measures. The best performing measure for time-preference is a
   titration method, in which a sequence of adaptive binary-choice
   questions narrows in on a subject's indifference point, and for
   risk-preference it is a self-report measure of risk aversion. Using
   factor analysis, we find that time preferences are well explained by a
   single factor, but risk preferences load on multiple factors. However,
   the first factor loads almost entirely on self-reported risk-preference
   measures, and this factor explains much of the variation. The evidence
   can help inform researchers about which elicitation methods to include
   in their surveys.},

Title = {Business Firms as Moral Agents: A Kantian Response to the Corporate
   Autonomy Problem},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ETHICS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {183},
Number = {4},
Pages = {999-1009},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {The idea that business firms qualify as group moral agents offers an
   attractive basis for understanding corporate moral responsibility.
   However, that idea gives rise to the ``corporate autonomy problem{''}
   (CAP): if firms are moral agents, then it seems we must accept the
   implausible conclusion that firms have basic moral rights, such as the
   rights to life and liberty. The question, then, is how one might retain
   the fruitful idea of firms as moral agents, yet avoid CAP. A common
   approach to avoiding CAP appeals to specific features of human
   embodiment, such as vulnerability to pain, as the basis for attributing
   moral rights to human persons but not to firms. But that response has
   less purchase in a Kantian framework, which does not ground moral status
   in such particularities of human embodiment, but rather in the rational
   nature that humans share with other rational beings. To avoid CAP while
   retaining a (broadly) Kantian framework, one does better to rely on
   features of firms as cooperative, compositionally derivative moral
   agents, created for the pursuit of specific ends. As derivative agents,
   firms do not qualify as Kantian ends in themselves, and thus are not
   appropriate bearers of basic moral rights. To further clarify the level
   of consideration we owe to firms, I draw on Darwall's distinction
   between recognition respect and moral esteem, arguing that we should not
   respect firms as unconditional ends in themselves, but rather esteem
   morally autonomous firms as collective achievements of their human
   members.},

Journal = {CONTEMPORARY ACCOUNTING RESEARCH},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {39},
Number = {1},

Month = {SPR},
Abstract = {I propose an explanation for the positive relation between R\&D, future
   earnings, and future stock returns based on the fixed-cost qualities of
   R\&D. If R\&D is relatively fixed over short horizons, demand shocks
   realized by some R\&D firms will push these firms into R\&D intensity
   levels that are suboptimal as common scale proxies-market equity,
   assets, and sales-respond more quickly to demand shocks than R\&D. In
   response, R\&D firms realizing negative demand shocks reduce future
   expenses and capital expenditures, producing higher future profitability
   on lower sales growth. Consistent with the fixed-cost hypothesis, I find
   the higher future profits of high R\&D firms are explained by cost
   cutting, not revenue growth. Collectively, the restructuring of cost and
   capital structures of the subset of high R\&D firms realizing demand
   shocks explains the future profit and investment patterns of R\&D firms,
   while the fixed-cost qualities of R\&D seem to explain patterns in
   future stock returns. My results have implications for literatures that
   examine how decisions on R\&D investment levels affect future firm
   performance, growth, and stock returns.},

Title = {Designing grant-review panels for better funding decisions: Lessons from
   an empirically calibrated simulation model},
Journal = {RESEARCH POLICY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {51},
Number = {4},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Objectives: To explore how factors relating to grades and grading affect
   the correctness of choices that grant review panels make among submitted
   proposals. To identify interventions in panel design that may be
   expected to increase the correctness of choices. Method: Experimentation
   with an empirically-calibrated computer simulation model of panel
   review. Model parameters are set in accordance with procedures at a
   national science funding agency. Correctness of choices among research
   proposals is operationalized as agreement with the choices of an elite
   panel. Conclusions: The simulation model generates several hypotheses to
   guide further research. Increasing the number of grades used by panel
   members increases the correctness of simulated choices among submitted
   proposals. Collective decision procedures giving panels a greater
   capacity for discriminating among proposals also increase correctness.
   Surprisingly, differences in grading standards among panel members do
   not appreciably decrease correctness.},

Month = {NOV-DEC},
Abstract = {Forecasters predicting the chances of a future event may disagree
   because of differing evidence or noise. To harness the collective
   evidence of the crowd, we propose a Bayesian aggregator that is
   regularized by analyzing the forecasters' disagreement and ascribing
   overdispersion to noise. Our aggregator requires no user intervention
   and can be computed efficiently even for a large number of predictions.
   To illustrate, we evaluate our aggregator on subjective probability
   predictions collected during a four-year forecasting tournament
   sponsored by the U.S. intelligence community. Our aggregator improves
   the squared error (a.k.a., the Brier score) of simple averaging by
   around 20\% and other commonly used aggregators by 10\%-25\%. This
   advantage stems almost exclusively from improved calibration. An R
   package called braggR implements ourmethod and is available on CRAN.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {49},
Number = {3},
Pages = {409-429},
Month = {SEP 22},
Abstract = {How do historically stigmatized social groups consume strategically when
   they have achieved greater recognition, status, and respectability in
   society? Based on a seven-year interpretive social representations
   analysis of gay men in Germany, the authors first show that dominant,
   stigmatizing representations of such groups do not ameliorate uniformly
   and for all. Instead, they fragment into oppressive, enabling, and
   normalized societal representations that different consumers encounter
   to different degrees in their everyday lives. In the wake of these
   societal shifts, the stigmatized group itself disintegrates into five
   representational subgroups, referred to as underground, discrete,
   hybrid, assimilated, and post-stigma social groups. These subgroups use
   consumption for different and partly opposing strategic purposes, such
   as hiding and denial, collective resistance, and deconstruction of
   differences. The authors synthesize their findings into a conceptual
   model of consumption under fragmented stigma that extends prior research
   on consumption under dominant and total stigma configurations and
   suggests ways in which consumption can not only mitigate but also
   reinforce stigma. In doing so, they also shed light on the complex lived
   experiences of a vulnerable social group that has become almost equal.},

Abstract = {During the 2020 COVID-19 epidemic, the U.S. Congress passed the CARES
   Act that (among other measures) provides direct payments to households.
   Using a large debit cards database, we analyze consumer expenditures
   following the stimulus payments. We observe zip code level daily
   transactions (approximately 12 million cards) before and immediately
   following the disbursements of stimulus checks. Empirical analysis
   exploits geographical variation in timing of federal deposits to
   identify marginal propensity to consume (MPC) for stimulus payments. We
   estimate between 0.29 (excluding banking) and 0.51 (all spend) of the
   rebate is spent within a few days of receipt. We find large
   crosssectional heterogeneity with MPC estimates that are three times
   higher in magnitude in the most densely populated urban areas with
   higher cost-of-living. In areas with more restricted movement during the
   pandemic (as measured by Google workplace mobility), MPC estimates are
   approximately 60\% higher. We reanalyze data from previous fiscal
   initiatives (2001 tax rebates and the 2008 fiscal stimulus) and find
   similar geographical differences. Collectively our results highlight an
   important shortcoming in fiscal policies that ignore local environment,
   particularly cross-sectional differences in cost-of-living across},

   Markets},

Volume = {33},
Number = {6},
Pages = {2274-2299},

Abstract = {A growing body of scholarship studies the emergence of moral
   markets-sectors offering market-based solutions to social and
   environmental issues. To date, researchers have largely focused on the
   drivers of firm entry into these values-laden sectors. However, we know
   comparatively little about postentry dynamics or the determinants of
   firm survival in moral markets. This study examines how regional
   institutional logics-spatially bound, socially constructed meaning
   systems that legitimize specific practices and goals within a
   community-shape firm survival in emerging moral markets. Using a unique
   panel of firms entering the first eight years of the U.S. green building
   supply industry, we find that (1) a regional market logic amplifies the
   impacts of market forces by increasing the positive impact of market
   adoption and the negative impact of localized competition on firm
   survival, (2) a regional proenvironmental logic dampens the impacts of
   adoption and competition on firm survival, and ( 3) institutional
   complexity-the co-occurrence of both market and proenvironmental logics
   in a region-negates the traditional advantages of de alio (diversifying
   incumbent) firms, creating an opportunity for de novo (entrepreneurial
   entrant) firms to compete more effectively. Our study integrates
   research on industry emergence, institutional logics, and firm survival
   to address important gaps in our knowledge regarding the evolution and
   growth of environmental entrepreneurship in moral markets.},

Abstract = {I provide evidence on the effects of financial audit mandates in the

   empirical strategy relies on variation in size-based exemption
   thresholds across states and differences in size driven by the nature of
   charities' activities. Consistent with audit mandates reducing donors'
   reliance on charity reputation, I find audit mandates are associated
   with a lower concentration of donations on the largest, most well-known
   charities. I show this reallocation of resources allows the charitable
   sector to serve more diverse geographic areas and social needs. In terms
   of the effect on willingness to give, I document that audit mandates are
   associated with a higher proportion of taxpayers who donate. However, I
   only observe a sizable impact on total contributions in dollars for
   charities with high inherent information asymmetry. Collectively, these
   results suggest financial audit regulation reduces information frictions
   and thereby affects resource allocation in the market for charitable
   giving.},

Year = {2023},
Volume = {182},

Abstract = {Research on ethical leadership in organizations has been largely based
   on Western philosophical traditions and has tended to focus on Western
   corporate experiences. Insights gained from such studies may however not
   be universally applicable in other cultural contexts. This paper
   examines the normative grounds for an alternative Confucian virtue-based
   ethics of leadership in China. As with Western corporations,
   organizational practices in China are profoundly shaped by their own
   cultural history and philosophical outlook. The ethical norms guiding
   both the practice and theory of leadership in China are underpinned by
   indigenous Chinese wisdoms imbued in their own traditions and China's
   collective psyche. Focusing on three fundamental aspects of Confucian
   virtue ethics: ren (humaneness benevolence), yi ((sic) righteousness)
   and li(c; ritual propriety), this paper proposes that an ideal Confucian
   leader regards self-cultivation as a first priority; status and material
   gain, whilst important, are not the foremost concern. S/he exemplifies
   the virtuous role model, exudes moral charisma and influences others by
   shaping an organization's ethical culture through the process of
   ritualization. The paper concludes by claiming that amplifying the
   explicit discourse around Confucian virtue ethics will help contribute
   to the development of better ethical leadership in China.},

Abstract = {Teams have increasingly turned to computer-mediated communication (CMC)
   to work when team members cannot all be in the same physical space at
   the same time, leading to the need to better understand what influences
   group performance in these settings. We know that team member
   intelligence and personality affect team performance when teams work
   face-to-face, but their effects are not yet clear when teams use
   text-based CMC, which has different characteristics than face-to-face
   communication. We conducted a laboratory study of 61 teams working on a
   decision-making task using text-based CMC. We found that team mean
   extraversion had a large negative effect, and team mean neuroticism had
   a medium-sized negative effect on team performance. Team mean
   intelligence had no effect. We recommend that managers consider the
   effects of extraversion when selecting team members and focus on
   selecting more introverted team members if the team is likely to
   extensively use text-based CMC. Likewise, managers should consider
   extraversion when designing teamwork processes for virtual teams; if a
   team has many members who are high in extraversion, the team should use
   text-based CMC sparingly. We also recommend that researchers use
   extraversion as a control factor in future research studying text-based
   CMC because extraversion has a large effect on team outcomes and, left
   uncontrolled, could increase unexplained error variance and overshadow
   the focus of the research study.},

Abstract = {How do social interactions shape collective action, and how are they
   mediated by networked information technologies? We answer these
   questions studying the Temperance Crusade, a wave of anti-liquor protest
   activity spreading across 29 states between 1873 and 1874. Relying on
   exogenous variation in network links generated by rail -road accidents,
   we provide causal evidence of social interactions driving the diffusion
   of the movement, mediated by rail and telegraph information about
   neighboring activity. Local newspaper coverage of the crusade was a key
   channel mediating these effects. Using an event-study methodology, we
   find strong complementarities between rail and telegraph networks in
   driving the movement's spread. (JEL D83, J16, L92, L96, N31, N41, N71)},

   workplace among men and women},
Journal = {ORGANIZATIONAL BEHAVIOR AND HUMAN DECISION PROCESSES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {168},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Drawing from precarious manhood theory, which proposes that manhood is
   an unstable social status and requires repair when threatened, we argue
   that gender threats at work motivate deviance and inhibit citizenship
   behavior for men, but not women. Beyond extending the tenets of
   precarious manhood theory into the work domain, we also integrate it
   with self-determination theory and explain why such effects are mediated
   by thwarted autonomy needs. We initially test these propositions in a
   survey study with working adults and an experiment, demonstrating that
   men respond with greater deviance when their gender status is
   threatened, relative to women. We then test our entire theoretical model
   in an experimental experience sampling (i.e., twice daily diary) study
   within an organization. Here, our findings indicate that gender threats
   at the beginning of the workday (but not other threats to
   self-integrity) uniquely lead to increased daily workplace deviance and
   reduced daily organizational citizenship behavior for men (but not
   women), via autonomy needs thwarting (but not other self-determination
   needs). Collectively, our results shed light on the nature of gender
   threats, and their consequences for employee behavior.},

Title = {Better now than later: The social cost of victims' delayed accusations},
Journal = {ORGANIZATIONAL BEHAVIOR AND HUMAN DECISION PROCESSES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {168},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Victims of many types of transgressions may delay voicing accusations of
   wrongdoing. Across seven studies and a within-paper meta-analysis, we
   examine whether these victims pay a social cost and, if so, how they can
   reduce it. We find that people perceive victims who delay (vs. do not
   delay) voicing accusations to have less psychological standing to accuse
   their transgressors. People therefore perceive such victims as lacking
   in integrity-based trustworthiness and, often, in benevolence-based
   trustworthiness as well. People consequently report greater intentions
   to avoid such victims, trust them less in an economic game with money at
   stake, and are less willing to hire them. The findings collectively
   highlight the difficulty that victims face in moving from silence to
   voice. We further draw on the triangle model of excuses (e.g.,
   Schlenker, 1997) to identify attributions that attenuate the social cost
   of victims' delayed accusations.},

   Schumpeterian Perspective},
Journal = {ORGANIZATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {33},
Number = {1},
Pages = {105-125},
Month = {JAN-FEB},
Abstract = {This paper develops and deploys a theoretical framework for assessing
   the prospects of a cluster of technologies driving what is often called
   the digital transformation. There is considerable uncertainty regarding
   this transformation's future trajectory, and to understand and bound
   that uncertainty, we build on Schumpeter's macro-level theory of
   economy-wide, technological revolutions and on the work of several
   scholars who have extended that theory. In this perspective, such
   revolutions' trajectories are shaped primarily by the interaction of
   changes within and between three spheres-technology, organization, and
   public policy. We enrich this account by identifying the critical
   problems and the collective choices among competing solutions to those
   problems that together shape the trajectory of each revolution. We argue
   that the digital transformation represents a new phase in the wider arc
   of the information and communication technology revolution-a phase
   promising much wider deployment-and that the trajectory of this
   deployment depends on collective choices to be made in the organization
   and public policy spheres. Combining in a 2 x 2 matrix the two main
   alternative solutions on offer in each of these two spheres, we identify
   four scenarios for the future trajectory of the digital transformation:
   digital authoritarianism, digital oligarchy, digital localism, and
   digital democracy. We discuss how these scenarios can help us trace and
   understand the future trajectory of the digital transformation.},

Journal = {ORGANIZATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {33},
Number = {6},
Pages = {2346-2363},
Month = {NOV-DEC},
Abstract = {Hierarchies emerge as collectives attempt to organize themselves toward
   successful performance. Consequently, research has focused on how team
   hierarchies affect performance. We extend existing models of the
   hierarchy-performance relationship by adopting an alternative:
   Performance is not only an output of hierarchy but also a critical
   input, as teams' hierarchical differentiation may vary based on whether
   they are succeeding. Integrating research on exploitation and
   exploration with work on group attributions, we argue that teams engage
   in exploitation by committing to what they attribute as the cause of
   their performance success. Specifically, collectives tend to attribute
   their success to individuals who wielded greater influence within the
   team; these individuals are consequently granted relatively higher
   levels of influence, leading to a higher degree of hierarchy. We
   additionally suggest that the tendency to attribute, and therefore grant
   more influence, to members believed to be the cause of success is
   stronger for teams previously higher (versus lower) in hierarchy, as a
   higher degree of hierarchical differentiation provides clarity as to
   which members had a greater impact on the team outcome. We test our
   hypotheses experimentally with teams engaging in an online judgement
   task and observationally with teams from the National Basketball
   Association. Our work makes two primary contributions: (a) altering
   existing hierarchy-performance models by highlighting performance as
   both an input and output to hierarchy and (b) extending research on the
   dynamics of hierarchy beyond individual rank changes toward examining
   what factors increase or decrease hierarchical differentiation of the
   team as a whole.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF APPLIED PSYCHOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {107},
Number = {11},
Pages = {1889-1906},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Organizations are increasingly called upon to solve complex problems in
   changing conditions that require the combined knowledge, skills,
   perspectives, and efforts of multiple individuals. These dynamic
   situations often require dynamic team composition. Dynamic team
   composition is sometimes thought of as synonymous to changes in
   membership, however, we contend that it also can occur through other
   means including team member development, the alignment between team
   member capabilities and the team's tasks, and changes in the
   accessibility to team member capabilities. Given the lack of overarching
   theories to organize and provide guidance on research and practice
   related to dynamic team composition, we take an interdisciplinary
   approach and leverage the fundamental concepts of potential and kinetic
   energy as a guiding framework to integrate the disparate literatures on
   dynamic team composition. We bring dynamic team composition to the
   forefront and delineate four types of dynamic team composition through
   staffing, development, situational relevance of member knowledge,
   skills, and abilities (KSAs) and access to member KSAs through
   relational resources. Next, we provide tangible recommendations for the
   design, measurement, and analysis of dynamic team composition. Finally,
   we provide guidance on developing dynamic research questions and
   infusing dynamics into existing theories.},

Title = {Information Asymmetry Among Investors and Strategic Bidding in
   Peer-to-Peer Lending},
Journal = {INFORMATION SYSTEMS RESEARCH},
Year = {2021},
Month = {2021 DEC 21},
Abstract = {We study how investors in peer-to-peer (P2P) lending use their
   information advantages in decisions on when to place bids. Literature
   documents that better-informed bidders may withhold bidding until the
   last moment (i.e., ``sniping{''}) to avoid competition. We argue that,
   because a collective effort from investors is required in P2P lending,
   it could be optimal for informed investors to bid early in projects with
   a low probability of being funded with the purpose of signaling the
   quality of these projects. With a unique data set from Prosper.com, we
   use a matching analysis to show that, for projects with low credit
   grades, the probability of being successfully funded is positively
   correlated with early bids from informed investors. For funded loans,
   informed investors are more likely to bid in the early stage than
   uninformed investors, whereas uninformed investors will follow and bid
   at the late stage. Finally, there are more early bids from informed
   investors for ``good{''} loans than for ``bad{''} loans, indicating that
   the bids are informative for the quality of those projects. Our findings
   have important implications for managing the information asymmetry and
   strategic behaviors among investors on P2P lending platforms.},

Abstract = {Despite a growing interest in power in sensemaking, our understanding of
   how power is linked with language is still theoretically underdeveloped.
   To this end, we develop a critical discursive perspective on sensemaking
   comprised of a three-part theoretical framework that elucidates the
   discursive underpinnings of power in organisational sensemaking. We
   first explain how discursive practices are used to turn cues into
   meaning. We then conceptualize how power operates within three layers of
   discursive practices: discursive strategies, genres, and discourses.
   This leads us to explain how the resulting sense can be conceptualized
   as common sense, new sense, or non-sense. The main contribution of this
   paper is to help us understand how discursive practices underpin the
   operation of power in organisational sensemaking, thus adding a missing
   piece to sensemaking research. Our discursive analysis also advances
   understanding of the role of language in sensemaking more generally, has
   methodological implications for sensemaking research, and helps to move
   critical discourse studies forward in organisational contexts.},

Abstract = {Do high job demands help employees to stay challenged at work, or do
   they challenge their well-being? Despite burnout being an ever-pressing
   matter in contemporary workspaces, the understanding of the link between
   job demands and burnout remains limited, especially considering the
   important multilayered role of context in organizations. Our study
   develops an integrated perspective on the antecedents of burnout, rather
   than viewing various elements in isolation. Specifically, we uncover a
   three-way interaction among job demands, collective trust, and
   competitive pressure across the three levels of study via a multilevel
   analysis of 5485 employees, nested into 2872 units in 89 German
   organizations. The three-way interaction of individual-level job demands
   with unit-level collective trust depends on the magnitude of competitive
   pressure at the organizational level. In a condition of low
   organizational-level competitive pressure, unit-level trust can mitigate
   the positive effect of individual job demands on burnout. Our findings
   indicate that job demands can be a double-edged sword, bringing with
   them both benefits and burdens. From a practical perspective, we provide
   guidance for organizations on how to maintain high job demands by
   emphasizing collective trust and open communication about
   organizational-level competitive pressure to mitigate burnout at work.},

Abstract = {This study aims to examine and design operational strategies for mixed
   flows of autonomous vehicles (AVs) and human-driven vehicles (HVs). We
   propose a stylized model wherein utilitarian individuals either drive
   HVs or take privately operated AVs that are collectively dispatched. In
   the baseline mixed policy where AVs and HVs share the same lanes, we
   find that AVs under-join the traffic (queue) while HVs over-join. We
   identify a ``crowding-out effect{''} such that AVs will tend to mitigate
   the over-joining HVs and reduce overall congestion/throughput. To
   improve the traffic efficiency of the baseline mixed policy, we consider
   a fully dedicated policy in which both AVs and HVs are segregated to
   different lanes and a partially dedicated policy in which only AVs enjoy
   dedicated lanes. We find that dedicated policies outperform the mixed
   policy in both social welfare and the aggregate throughput when the
   platooning effect is moderate or strong. Exact conditions are derived
   for the selection of fully dedicated policy and partially dedicated
   policy. Furthermore, we find that a carefully designed subsidy is
   necessary for the dedicated policy to simultaneously improve the social
   welfare and the throughput when the platooning effect is very weak.
   These results shed interesting light on the policy regulation for the
   emerging mixed autonomous paradigm: a dedicated policy with proper lane
   design and subsidy (if necessary) will improve both social welfare and
   aggregate throughput.},

Abstract = {Where do hybrid companies flourish and why? We draw on economic theories
   of agglomeration and sociocultural theories of community to examine the
   specific contexts in which hybrids flourish, and offer an understanding
   of why place matters to the unique business models they employ. We
   hypothesize that a community's collectivism, political orientation, and
   third sector munificence have distinct roles in promoting hybrid company
   agglomeration. We test these hypotheses with data drawn from a variety
   of sources, covering 260 U.S. Metropolitan Statistical Areas across 17
   years. Our results indicate that both economic and sociocultural
   theories offer explanatory power, and their union more completely
   explains hybrid agglomeration. Additional analyses enrich our
   understanding of how this agglomeration unfolds over time.},

Abstract = {Although studies underscore the importance of creating a coherent
   collective identity in order to legitimate a new market category,
   strategy and entrepreneurship research is divided on whether and to what
   degree an entrepreneur will engage in collective action to promote the
   identity. To reconcile the inconsistency, we introduce the concept of
   entrepreneurial shared fate-the belief of a focal venture that it and
   its competitors are bound together by a sense of belongingness and
   equally experience similar consequences-and explore how external threats
   can influence the degree of shared fate. We conceptually distinguish
   between communal and individual threats and propose that communal
   threats will increase, whereas individual threats will decrease, shared
   fate. We also explore boundary conditions that strengthen and weaken the
   main effects of perceived communal and individual threats on collective
   identity promotion. Empirically, we examine venture identity framing in
   response to forest-conservation activism in the U.S. wood pellet market.
   Implications for research on new market categories, collective identity,
   optimal distinctiveness, and forest management are discussed.},

Abstract = {Organizational decision making that leverages the collective wisdom and
   knowledge of multiple individuals is ubiquitous in management practice,
   occurring in settings such as top management teams, corporate boards,
   and the teams and groups that pervade modern organizations.
   Decision-making structures employed by organizations shape the
   effectiveness of knowledge aggregation. We argue that decision-making
   structures play a second crucial role in that they shape the learning of
   individuals that participate in organizational decision making. In
   organizational decision making, individuals do not engage in learning by
   doing but, rather, in what we call learning by participating, which is
   distinct in that individuals learn by receiving feedback not on their
   own choices but, rather, on the choice made by the organization. We
   examine how learning by participating influences the efficacy of
   aggregation and learning across alternative decision-making structures
   and group sizes. Our central insight is that learning by participating
   leads to an aggregation learning trade off in which structures that are
   effective in aggregating information can be ineffective in fostering
   individual learning. We discuss implications for research on
   organizations in the areas of learning, microfoundations, teams, and
   crowds.},

Abstract = {We examine whether audit firm alma mater ties between the auditor and
   the audit committee (AC) are associated with significantly greater
   nonaudit services (NAS) provided by the auditor. We further examine
   whether greater NAS in the presence of such alma mater ties are
   associated with audit quality. Since the AC is responsible for approving
   and monitoring the services provided by the auditor, the presence of AC
   and auditor alma mater ties underscores the controversies surrounding
   such ties' undermining audit quality. Predicating our hypotheses on
   social ties theory, we find a positive association between the presence
   of an audit firm alumnus on the AC and NAS acquired from the alma mater
   auditor. We further find that this association becomes stronger as the
   tenure of the alumnus increases. Next, using multiple measures of audit
   quality, we find that, when the alumnus on the AC is associated with
   significantly more NAS provided by the alma mater audit firm, the
   quality of the audit suffers. Collectively, our results suggest that
   audit firm alma mater ties between the AC and auditor engender economic
   ties that adversely affect audit quality. Our study provides new
   evidence on the channels through which the quality of the audit is
   affected and raises important implications for the composition of the
   AC, auditor-provided NAS, and client assignment to engagement partners.},

Abstract = {Income taxes are a major expense for profitable corporations, often
   totaling 25\% or more of pretax income. This study exploits the market
   for corporate control to test competing agency-based and risk-based
   explanations of corporate tax planning. Exploiting the staggered
   enactment of M\&A laws across countries that increased the threat of
   takeover as an exogenous shock that allows a powerful
   difference-indifferences design, we find a significant reduction in tax
   avoidance following the takeover law passage. Our analysis suggests that
   reduced private benefits consumption (i.e., rent extraction) by
   management, rather than managerial effort aversion or increased risk
   concerns associated with aggressive tax strategies, is the likely
   mechanism through which takeover laws impact tax avoidance.
   Collectively, our findings extend the literature by highlighting the
   role of the corporate control market in shaping cross-sectional
   variation in corporate tax avoidance.},

   underperform those of nonexposed counterparts, by an amount that is
   significant and economically large in magnitude. The results remain
   robust to unobserved skill differences, the potential endogeneity of
   housing prices, the self-selection of analysts into neighborhoods with
   certain traits, and placebo tests where housing wealth shocks are
   randomized across analysts. Collectively, this study provides new

   bonds trade in the secondary market at lower yields than otherwise
   similar no-CAC bonds. The yield differential widens in countries with
   worse ratings and in those with stronger legal systems, especially if of
   midrange quality. Hence, CACs are seen as pro- rather than anticreditor

Abstract = {One important benefit of teamwork is the exchange and integration of
   diverse knowledge, experience, and opinions group members bring to the
   table. However, demographic attributes-such as race, gender, and
   functional background-may create asymmetric influence patterns between
   group members in diverse groups because these demographic
   characteristics are often associated with status differences. In the
   current research, we examine how to attenuate this disparity in member
   influence in diverse groups by focusing on the role of a leader's gazing
   behavior. Across two studies, we found that asymmetric influence
   patterns in which high-status members tend to wield greater influence in
   group decision-making processes were attenuated when a leader increased
   their visual attention toward low-status members in the group. This
   reduced disparity in member influence which in turn improved group
   information elaboration and group performance in a collective
   decision-making task. Theoretical and practical implications for
   leaders' visual attention, diversity, group decision-making processes,
   and group performance are discussed.},

Abstract = {Through the lens of social movement theory, this paper investigates the
   drivers of individual users' social influence on Twitter during the
   Egyptian Revolution of 2011. Following this lens, we suggest an extended
   model of sustained social influence (that considers retweets as the
   measure of user influence) as a function of the duality of individual
   Twitter users' social actions and the underlying facilitating Twitter
   network structure. Based on an analysis of organic large-scale Twitter
   data on this social movement, we examine how characteristics of
   individuals' social actions, namely activity and tenure on Twitter, and
   characteristics facilitated by the network (i.e., the number of
   followers as well as centrality in the community structure of Twitter),
   impact retweet influence in time windows spanning the movement.
   Utilizing a mixed methods approach consisting of machine learning and
   human coding we conceptualize social movement-related engagement
   activities of Twitter users, which map to generic frames of social
   movement mobilization. The analysis reveals interesting patterns across
   different contexts of the Egyptian Revolution. Regarding individual
   social action, social movement related to ``who{''} and ``where{''}
   activities, as well as tenure, were found to contribute to individual
   social influence. In terms of the facilitating structure, the follower
   network (an observed network structure) and centrality (an unobserved
   network structure) were both found to contribute significantly to
   sustained influence.},

   has become the subject of criticism and accused of pervasive impropriety
   to the point of inducing widespread violence from patients. Drawing on
   archival documents, media articles, interviews, and secondary sources,
   we trace the lengthy and uneven trajectory by which the profession moved
   away from enjoying widespread collective approval toward ambivalence and
   eventual stigmatization. We develop a process model of professional
   stigmatization that identifies the dynamics that precipitate and then
   catalyze that trajectory and highlight the underpinning mechanisms. By
   unpacking the complex process of stigmatization, the study extends
   existing understanding of how aspects of stigma emerge and are attached
   by different stakeholders to a profession and the consequences that
   follow. We conclude by highlighting the implications for research on
   stigma and the challenge of stigma containment.},

Abstract = {We examine whether dividends serve as substitutes or complements to
   accounting information in firm valuation. Consistent with dividends
   substituting for earnings information, we find that dividend paying
   firms have 11\%-15\% lower earnings response coefficients (ERCs) than
   non-payers. We find more substitution when the dividend provides a
   stronger signal of permanent earnings: when the firm is less likely to
   cut the dividend, when the firm is likely to fund the dividend out of
   earnings rather than cash reserves, or when the dividend is larger. We
   then show that dividend payers have lower absolute returns, less trading
   volume, and fewer analyst forecasts at the earnings announcement (EA),
   suggesting that dividend payers attract less attention to their less
   informative EAs. Finally, we show that the lower EA attention translates
   into less earnings management and fewer earnings-related disclosures for
   dividend payers relative to non-payers. Collectively, this evidence
   suggests that dividends supply information about permanent earnings and,
   although costly, could be an efficient way for some firms to satisfy
   investors' demand for earnings information.},

Abstract = {Collective entrepreneurship has been found to alleviate extreme poverty
   by helping poor individuals integrate into their societies and overcome
   their multiple intertwined liabilities. We complement this line of
   inquiry by exploring the conditions under which group structures may
   instead reinforce economic and gendered poverty constraints.
   We conducted grounded-theoretical interviews with 104 women
   entrepreneurs operating in farming cooperatives and non-farm groups in
   war-torn South-West Cameroon. Analysing our data through a constitutive
   lens, we found that discipline, the extent to which rules determine and
   control individual behaviours, helps poor women overcome extreme
   economic constraints but prevents them from attaining prosperity and
   emancipation.},

Title = {An agentic perspective of resourcefulness: Self-reliant and joint
   resourcefulness behaviors within the entrepreneurship process},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BUSINESS VENTURING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {37},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {We integrate social cognitive theory, and its tenets of personal and
   collective agency, to develop an individual-level perspective on
   entrepreneurs' resourcefulness behaviors that illustrates how
   resourcefulness behaviors can be classified as `self-reliant behaviors'
   or `joint resourcefulness behaviors'. Using this novel cognitive
   theoretical approach, we provide and test a framework that explains how
   dispositional, perceptual, and behavioral factors interact in the
   enactment of purposeful action with regards to entrepreneurs'
   resourceful behaviors. Consistent with our hypotheses, results from a
   quantitative study of entrepreneurs (N = 178), as well as a supplemental
   study involving qualitative interviews with entrepreneurs (N = 15),
   highlight that entrepreneurs higher in frugality tend to perceive higher
   levels of environmental hostility. This relationship, in turn, leads to
   higher amounts of self-reliant resourcefulness behaviors (i.e.,
   customer-related and internal self-financing bootstrapping behaviors)
   but not joint resourcefulness behaviors. Multiple theoretical and
   practical contributions emerge from our findings as the extant
   literature does not yet account for human agency as a reason why some
   entrepreneurs may choose to engage in certain resourceful behaviors
   relative to other behaviors.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ETHICS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {182},
Number = {3},
Pages = {747-781},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Joining voluntary thematic initiatives can be a means for firms to
   legitimate their business activities. However, a lack of review
   mechanisms could create incentives for free-riding. This might lead to a
   lower commitment to the initiative's principles, and endanger its
   credibility and its members' legitimacy benefits. Whether members of
   voluntary initiatives take advantage of the opportunity to free-ride has
   not been analyzed empirically so far. To fill this research gap, we
   investigate from an institutional theory perspective the actual
   implementation behavior of publicly listed signatories of the United
   Nations Principles for Responsible Investment (UN PRI) in a
   difference-in-differences and an event study setting. Our empirical
   results show that, after signing, UN PRI signatories integrate
   environmental, social, and governance (ESG) criteria in their business
   activities significantly more than matched non-signatories from the
   financial sector, indicating the commitment of the signatories to the UN
   PRI in general. However, while the initial members show a high
   commitment to the initiative's principles by increasing their ESG
   integration performance substantially, new members signing at a later
   stage of the initiative perform considerably less, and thus undermine
   the UN PRI's credibility. We derive implications for voluntary thematic
   initiatives to avoid such a development.},

Abstract = {Accountability is of universal interest to the business ethics
   community, but the emphasis to date has been primarily at the level of
   the industry, organization, or key individuals. This paper unites
   concepts from relational and felt accountability and team dynamics to
   provide an initial explanatory framework that emphasizes the importance
   of social interactions to team accountability. We develop a measure of
   team accountability using participants in the USA and Europe and then
   use it to study a cohort of 65 teams of Irish business students over
   three months as they complete a complex simulation. Our hypotheses test
   the origins of team accountability and its effects on subsequent team
   performance and attitudinal states. Results indicate that initial team
   accountability is strongly related to team trust, commitment, efficacy,
   and identifying with the team emotionally. In established teams,
   accountability increases effort and willingness to continue to
   collaborate but did not significantly improve task performance in this
   investigation.},

Journal = {ADMINISTRATIVE SCIENCE QUARTERLY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {67},
Number = {2},
Pages = {378-422},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Learning vicariously from the experiences of others at work, such as
   those working on different teams or projects, has long been recognized
   as a driver of collective performance in organizations. Yet as work
   becomes more ambiguous and less observable in knowledge-intensive
   organizations, previously identified vicarious learning strategies,
   including direct observation and formal knowledge transfer, become less
   feasible. Drawing on ethnographic observations and interviews with
   flight nurse crews in an air medical transport program, I inductively
   build a model of how storytelling can serve as a valuable tool for
   vicarious learning. I explore a multistage process of triggering,
   telling, and transforming stories as a means by which flight nurses
   convert the raw experience of other crews' patient transports into
   prospective knowledge and expanded repertoires of responses for
   potential future challenges. Further, I highlight how this storytelling
   process is situated within the transport program's broader structures
   and practices, which serve to enable flight nurses' storytelling and to
   scale the lessons of their stories throughout the entire program. I
   discuss the implications of these insights for the study of storytelling
   as a learning tool in organizations, as well as for revamping the
   field's understanding of vicarious learning in knowledge-intensive work
   settings.},

Abstract = {Judgments about others' personal characteristics intertwine with social
   interactions in the workplace. The personality and social psychology
   literatures show forming impressions of what others are like is vitally
   important, in part, because it facilitates the forecasting and
   acceptance of others' behavior. Interestingly, very few studies consider
   others' (i.e., subordinates) judgments about their leaders' personality
   and whether correspondence between leaders' self-perceptions and these
   others' judgments is capable of providing meaningful and unique
   information. Using a socioanalytic perspective that considers multiple
   stakeholders, this study explores the (in)congruence effects between
   leaders' self-perception of narcissism (i.e., identity) and
   subordinates' perceptions of their leaders' narcissism (i.e.,
   reputation) on two types of performance outcomes. Polynomial regression
   and response surface analysis indicate that congruence between leaders'
   narcissism identity and subordinates' aggregated ratings of leaders'
   narcissistic reputation related to group task and contextual performance
   via shared justice perceptions and collective effort in Study 1. Results
   of Study 2, which focused on leader-subordinate dyads, found leaders'
   narcissism identity-reputation congruence effects were related to
   individual subordinates' task and contextual performance via the
   subordinate's individual justice perceptions, but not by way of
   individual effort. These findings have important implications for
   leaders and organizations and suggest that to fully understand the
   implications of leaders' narcissism, one should consider the
   perspectives of interacting parties and how they converge or diverge
   when investigating relationships with aspects of performance.},

Abstract = {Blockholder monitoring is central to corporate governance, but
   blockholders large enough to exercise significant unilateral influence
   are rare. Mechanisms that enable moderately sized blockholders to exert
   collective influence are therefore important. Existing theory suggests
   that engagement by moderately sized blockholders is unlikely, especially
   when the blocks are held by delegated asset managers who have limited
   skin in the game. We present a model in whichmultiple delegated
   blockholders engage targetmanagement in parallel, that is, ``wolf pack
   activism.{''} Delegation reduces skin in the game, which decreases
   incentives for engagement. However, it also induces competition over
   investor capital (i.e., competition for flow). We show that this
   increases engagement incentives and helps ameliorate the problem of
   insufficient engagement, although it can also foster excess engagement.
   Under competition for flow, the total amount of capital seeking skilled
   activistmanagers is relevant to engagement incentives, which helps to
   predict when and where wolf packs arise. Flow incentives are
   particularly valuable in incentivizing engagement by packswith

Abstract = {The purpose of this study is to empirically examine the relations
   between audit outcomes and accounting standard design (principles-based
   vs. rules-based) for US firms. Considering that audit outcomes may vary
   with audit risk, which may differ under different accounting standards,
   we examine and find that audit risk and audit fees are lower when client
   firms rely more on principles-based standards. Next, we find that
   principles-based standards are associated with a lower likelihood of
   receiving a going concern opinion and with a shorter audit report lag.
   However, for firms that rely more on principles-based standards and have
   greater incentives to engage in earnings management, audit fees are
   higher. Collectively, our results inform the FASB, the SEC, and the
   PCAOB of the potential benefits of using principles-based standards with
   respect to audit outcomes and, more broadly, provide evidence on the
   role of accounting standard design in auditing.},

Abstract = {In this paper we examine how a socially innovative solution to a complex
   social problem is able to overcome entrenched disadvantage and division
   and sustain itself within an existing institution. We explore how a
   rugby team in a high-security prison in Argentina has become an
   organizational response that substantially transformed prisoners' lives
   in and out of jail, allowing inmates to reclaim many critical aspects of
   their humanity and dramatically reducing recidivism. We examine rugby as
   an analogy for new models of behaviours and identities in the context of
   extreme disadvantage, and surface the specific emotional work required
   to make the analogy generative. The findings from our in-depth case
   study reveal three reinforcing mechanisms in the workings of an analogy
   - resonating, resignifying and collective generativity - and in doing so
   provide a novel crescive model of how analogies may sustain change
   emotionally, cognitively and behaviorally over time, and ultimately
   achieve positive transformational effects in extreme social contexts.},

Volume = {76},
Number = {5},
Pages = {746-775},

Abstract = {How do professionals attempt to restore their credibility when it has
   been tarnished by crises or scandals? To address this issue, we examined
   how banking professionals who testified during a government inquiry into
   the 2008 banking crisis in Ireland responded when confronted with
   negative social evaluations (NSEs) evidenced by personal criticism of
   their judgment, competence, or morality. We find that professional
   credibility is renegotiated through two processes: depersonalization and
   personalization. Testifiers distanced themselves from criticism through
   a depersonalization process by which they reoriented the unfolding
   narrative toward broader collectives such as their own profession,
   adjacent professions, and the macroeconomic environment. They also
   engaged in a personalization process by which they showcased individual
   efforts to improve their work processes and outcomes to bolster their
   professional credibility. Our work theoretically elaborates the view of
   NSEs as being socially constructed and brings the role of professional
   credibility of individuals to the fore of the NSE literature. In doing
   so, it offers a broader perspective on the repertoire of criticisms and
   responses associated with NSEs than that documented by prior studies,
   and it emphasizes how professionals seek to reassert their credibility.
   We also present a less deterministic view of public inquiries.},

Abstract = {We examine whether and how CEO foreign experience affects firm's green

   hand-collected CEO foreign experience data, we document a positive
   association between CEO foreign experience and corporate green
   innovation. Furthermore, consistent with the view that CEOs with foreign
   experience would play a more significant role when provided with more
   resources, we find that the positive relationship is more pronounced in
   less financially constrained firms, in state-owned enterprises, and in
   less competitive industries. Additional analyses indicate that enhanced
   environmental ethics and general competency are two potential mechanisms
   through which CEO foreign experience affects corporate green innovation.
   Finally, we find that CEO foreign experience is positively related to
   green innovation quality and internationalization. Collectively, these
   findings suggest that CEO foreign experience is a significant factor for
   corporate green innovation in emerging markets.},

Abstract = {Organizations are riddled with cooperation problems, that is, instances
   in which workers need to voluntarily exert effort to achieve efficient
   collective outcomes. To sustain high levels of cooperation, the
   experimental literature demonstrates the centrality of reciprocal
   preferences but has also overlooked some of its negative consequences.
   In this paper, we ran lab-in-the-field experiments in the context of
   open-source software development teams to provide the first field
   evidence that highly reciprocating groups are not necessarily more
   successful in practice. Instead, the relationship between high
   reciprocity and performance can be more accurately described as
   U-shaped. Highly reciprocal teams are generally more likely to fail and
   only outperform other teams conditional on survival. We use the dynamic
   structure of our data on field contributions to demonstrate the
   underlying theoretical mechanism. Reciprocal preferences work as a
   catalyst at the team level: they reinforce the cooperative equilibrium
   in good times but also make it harder to recover from a negative signal
   (the project dies). Our results call into question the idea that strong
   reciprocity can shield organizations from cooperation breakdowns.
   Instead, cooperation needs to be dynamically managed through relational
   contracts.},

Abstract = {This study investigates the influence of three interest
   groups-businesses, the tax profession, and civil society-on tax rules in
   the context of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
   Development (OECD) Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) project. Our
   study is important as prior research has not examined the direct
   influence of various interest groups on the content of tax rules by
   means of comment letters. Using content analysis, we seek to explain the
   lobbying success of the different interest groups by examining the
   relevance of the kind of information transmitted and the alliance
   strategies used. Results indicate that lobbying success is mainly
   explained by the vested interests of the three groups, with businesses
   less successful than the other two interest groups as long as all
   interest groups are equally able to provide information. We also find
   that the lobbying success of businesses increases when proposals require
   specific expertise. However, bias is still relevant for lobbying success
   as we find that proposals from tax professionals with practical
   experience, likely to reflect less bias, are relatively more successful
   than proposals from businesses. Furthermore, our results suggest that
   mobilizing commenters who have a shared interest in the form of
   alliances is a promising lobbying strategy. Overall, our findings
   highlight the importance of expertise and collective actions for
   lobbying success.},

Title = {Hackathons as Affective Circuits: Technology, organizationality and

Journal = {ORGANIZATION STUDIES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {43},
Number = {7, SI},
Pages = {1019-1047},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Technology invites a reconsideration of organization and organizing by
   calling attention to mediated forms of value production among loose
   social collectives outside formal organizational boundaries. While the
   nascent concept of organizationality holds potential for such a
   re-conceptualization, the processes through which loose social members
   become invested in co-orientation and collective effort require further
   empirical and theoretical exploration. In this paper, we link
   organizationality research with critical media studies on affect and
   technology to theorize how affect holds provisional collectives together
   while promoting new modes of value extraction. Empirically, we draw from
   an ethnographic study of hackathons - transdigital innovation spaces
   where participants act with and through technology - and suggest three
   intertwined processes as part of an affective circuit that stokes and
   directs affect. The paper's contribution is threefold. First, by
   analysing how affective circuits bind, integrate and co-orient action
   among loose members, we contribute to understanding organizationality as
   affectively constituted. Second, by showing how hackathons leverage
   desire for community, we offer a critical perspective on affective
   capture and argue that organizationality involves novel modes of value
   production. Third, we complement theorizing of hackathons by exploring
   them as sites of organizationality, focusing on the provisional,
   relational and affect-rich nature of new forms of organizing in the
   digital age.},

Abstract = {For decades, brand managers have monitored brand health with the use of
   consumer surveys, which have been refined to address issues related to
   sampling bias, response bias, leading questions, etc. However, with the
   advance of Web 2.0 and the internet, consumers have turned to social
   media to express their opinions on a variety of topics and,
   subsequently, have generated an extremely large amount of interaction
   data with brands. Analyzing these publicly available data to measure
   brand health has attracted great research attention. In this study, we
   focus on developing a method to measure brand favorability while
   accounting for the measure biases exhibited by social media posters.
   Specifically, we propose a probabilistic graphical model-based
   collective inference framework and implement a block-based Markov chain
   Monte Carlo sampling technique to obtain an adjusted brand favorability
   measure that is correlated with traditional survey-based measures used
   by brands. For analysis, we collect and examine Facebook data for more
   than 3,300 brands and about 205 million unique users that interact with
   those brands via their Facebook brand pages. Our data set is large and
   contains 6.68 billion likes and full text for 1.01 billion user
   comments, creating challenges for any modeling efforts. We evaluate the
   effectiveness of our model via out-of-sample prediction, external ground
   truth testing, and simulation. All demonstrate that our model performs
   very well, providing brand managers with a new method to more accurately
   measure consumer opinions toward the brand using socialmedia data.},

Title = {A Framework for Authentic Ethical Decision Making in the Face of Grand
   Challenges: A Lonerganian Gradation},

Year = {2023},
Volume = {182},
Number = {2},

Abstract = {This paper contributes to the contemporary business ethics narrative by
   proposing an approach to corporate ethical decision making (EDM) which
   serves as an alternative to the imposition of codes and standards to
   address the ethical consequences of grand challenges, like COVID-19,
   which are impacting today's society. Our alternative approach to EDM
   embraces the concept of reflexive thinking and ethical consciousness
   among the individual agents who collectively are the corporation and who
   make ethical decisions, often in isolation, removed from the collocated
   corporate setting. We draw on the teachings of the Canadian philosopher
   and theologian, Fr. Bernard Lonergan, to conceptualize an approach to
   EDM which focuses on the ethics of the corporate agent by nurturing the
   universal and invariant structure that is operational in all human
   beings. Embracing Lonergan's dynamic cognitive structure of human
   knowing, and the structure of the human good, we advance a paradigm of
   EDM in business which emboldens authentic ethical thought, decision
   making, and action commensurate with virtuous living and germane to
   human flourishing. Lonergan's philosophy guides us away from the
   imposition of over-arching corporate codes of ethics and inspires us, as
   individual agents, to attend to the data of our own consciousness in our
   ethical decision making. Such cognitional endowment leads us out of the
   ethics of the `timeless present' (Islam and Greenwood in Journal of
   Business Ethics 170: 1-4, 2021) towards ethical authenticity in
   business, leaving us better placed to reflect upon and address the
   ethical issues emanating from grand challenges like COVID-19.},

Abstract = {A corporate board's work is largely dependent on the collective
   contributions of individual directors. Thus, greater board diversity,
   with its commensurate knowledge complementarity, should stimulate better
   board discussions when members actively participate. Without the
   participation of underrepresented directors, however, the potential
   benefits of board diversity are lost. Herein we examine the drivers of
   underrepresented directors' participation in board meetings. Departing
   from prior studies that often used a single-level, compositional view of
   board diversity, we explore the antecedents of individual
   underrepresented director participation with a multi-level,
   multi-theoretic model. We find strong empirical support for our model,
   derived from detailed board of director meeting transcripts, offering
   several theoretical contributions to the literature.},

Abstract = {Social movements seek allies as they campaign for social, political, and
   organizational changes. How do activists gain allies in the targeted
   institutions they hope to change? Despite recognition of the importance
   of ally support in theories about institutional change and social
   movements, these theories are largely silent on the microdynamics of
   ally mobilization. We examine how the labeling of organizational
   policies that benefit women influences potential workplace allies'
   support for these policies. We theorize that one barrier to mobilizing
   workplace allies is a misalignment of the labels that activists use to
   promote new policies and employees' affiliation with collective
   identities. We conducted five experiments to test our hypotheses and 26
   qualitative interviews to provide illustration of our core concepts. We
   demonstrate that employees high in feminist identification are more
   likely to support feminist-labeled (feminist and \#MeToo) than unlabeled
   policies, whereas those low in feminist identification are less likely
   to support feminist-labeled than unlabeled policies (Studies 1-3).
   However, we find that participants for whom organizational
   identification was high (whether measured or manipulated) and feminist
   identification was low supported organizationally labeled policies more
   than feminist-labeled polices (Studies 4 and 5). This illustrates that
   policies whose aims may not align with one collective identity can still
   gamer support by activating another relevant collective identity. Within
   our studies, we provide evidence that these effects are mediated via
   feelings of pride in the organization (and not fear or anger),
   suggesting that positive emotions are a central mechanism in mobilizing
   workplace allies.},

Title = {Ancillary Cost Implications of Physicians Multisiting and

Journal = {PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {31},
Number = {2},

Abstract = {This study investigates diagnostic testing and pharmacy expenditures,
   commonly referred to as ancillary costs in the United States acute-care
   hospitals. These ancillary costs are charges associated with services
   provided to support patient treatment, including laboratory, radiology,
   and pharmacy charges. Despite of investment in inter-organizational and
   technological collaboration practices, these costs continue to rise. Our
   research examines the role of individual healthcare providers, namely
   multisiting physicians, who practice at more than one hospital, in
   reducing ancillary cost. We also look at how inter-organizational
   collaboration measured by the hospital's affiliation in an accountable
   care organization (ACO) model affect this relationship. To do this, we
   assembled a unique data set of 163,617 patients treated by 4411
   physicians at 182 hospitals in Florida from 2014 to 2016. Using an
   econometric estimation approach accounting for endogeneity, we find that
   patients treated by multisiting physicians experienced, on an average,
   per-hospitalization reduction in laboratory and radiology charges of
   58.57\% and 30.11\%, respectively. These savings increase when
   multisiting physicians have less practice experience. We also find that
   hospitals participating in ACO model complement the savings achieved
   through multisiting physicians in the form of even lower pharmacy costs.
   In post-hoc analyses, we find such cost reduction comes from reducing
   the total number of procedures or tests ordered. We also show that the
   lower treatment charges do not compromise the clinical quality of
   patients treated by multisiting physicians. Collectively, the findings
   offer important insights to the healthcare operations management
   literature on the interaction between individual-organizational
   collaboration efforts and patient-level outcomes.},

Abstract = {Smartphones have made it nearly effortless to share images of branded
   experiences. This research classifies social media brand imagery and
   studies user response. Aside from packshots (standalone product images),
   two types of brand-related selfie images appear online: consumer selfies
   (featuring brands and consumers' faces) and an emerging phenomenon the
   authors term ``brand selfies{''} (invisible consumers holding a branded
   product). The authors use convolutional neural networks to identify
   these archetypes and train language models to infer social media
   response to more than a quarter-million brand-image posts (185 brands on
   Twitter and Instagram). They find that consumer-selfie images receive
   more sender engagement (i.e., likes and comments), whereas brand selfies
   result in more brand engagement, expressed by purchase intentions. These
   results cast doubt on whether conventional social media metrics are
   appropriate indicators of brand engagement. Results for display ads are
   consistent with this observation, with higher click-through rates for
   brand selfies than for consumer selfies. A controlled lab experiment
   suggests that self-reference is driving the differential response to
   selfie images. Collectively, these results demonstrate how
   (interpretable) machine learning helps extract marketing-relevant
   information from unstructured multimedia content and that selfie images
   are a matter of perspective in terms of actual brand engagement.},

Abstract = {Multinational corporations (MNCs) are considered as dispersed structures
   of power, in which diverse headquarters (HQ)-subsidiary power
   relationships collectively influence performance and management. Yet,
   few studies have accounted for the subsidiary portfolio characteristics
   shaped by the entire set of differentiated HQ-subsidiary power
   relationships, and little is known about their effect on the performance
   and management decisions of MNCs. Drawing on agency and resource
   dependence theories, this study investigates how the power structure of
   the MNC, or the pattern of power distribution in the subsidiary
   portfolio, affects MNC performance and expatriate utilization. Results
   from a comprehensive panel of Korean MNCs show that the degree of power
   concentration in the subsidiary portfolio has inverted U-shaped
   relationships with MNC performance and the use of expatriate control.
   However, the results also reveal that these relationships vary between
   manufacturing and downstream subsidiary portfolios. These findings
   suggest that the structural characteristics of the subsidiary portfolio
   are important determinants of MNC performance and management. This study
   opens an important new avenue for international business scholarship by
   explicitly conceptualizing the MNC as a portfolio of differentiated
   subsidiaries and by examining the consequences of the subsidiary
   portfolio characteristics.},

Abstract = {The current paper revisits and builds upon task demonstrability, which
   defines the criteria necessary for groups to choose a correct response
   if any member prefers that response. We identify boundary conditions of
   the current conceptualization of task demonstrability with respect to
   its use in understanding modern organizational teams. Specifically, we
   argue that, in its current form, task demonstrability is not optimally
   suited to studying ongoing teams in which member expertise varies and
   teams work to complete complex multifaceted tasks. To address this
   issue, we provide a revisited perspective on demonstrability. We specify
   the nomological network of revisited demonstrability and recast each of
   its criteria in a form that preserves the original intent of the
   construct, but has broader applicability, particularly to organizational
   contexts. We then discuss theoretical implications and managerial
   applications of the construct. Finally, noting that there is no standard
   assessment tool for demonstrability (original or revisited), we develop
   and validate a measure to facilitate future research.},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {What are the drivers of collective bargaining to achieve gender equality
   in companies? Although much research has been done on this question,
   answers tend to focus exclusively on the institutional perspective and
   to neglect the social and power relations at work. We address this
   deficiency in this article by taking a micro-political perspective. We
   trace the trajectory of a collectively bargained gender equality policy
   in a French company over 14 years and examine how management and unions
   contribute to the process. Our results show that the construction of a
   coalition between management and unions around gender equality, as well
   as the form taken by the bargained policy, are closely linked to the
   capabilities that these actors possess and mobilise. This study
   contributes to the understanding of gender equality bargaining and, more
   generally, to the micro-politics of collective bargaining. In doing so,
   it aims to connect organisation studies and industrial relations.},

Journal = {ACADEMY OF MANAGEMENT JOURNAL},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {64},
Number = {5},
Pages = {1497-1526},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Why do ideas that have been successfully moved across highly different
   contexts subsequently disappear? To answer this question, we use
   longitudinal data on the organization Villages for Africa that
   introduced ``macrocredit{''} loans to rural Tanzanians that would enable
   them to establish their own village enterprises. Several years after the
   implementation of the idea, it collapsed. Our findings allowus to make
   two key contributions. First, we provide a process model of
   high-distance translation that shows how proponents can strategically
   introduce an idea across highly different contexts by ``culturally
   detaching{''} it from its institutional origins, leading to the idea
   being ``culturally assimilated{''} into the recipient context. However,
   although cultural detachment and cultural assimilation indicate the
   successful translation of an idea, the means of doing so can later
   prompt its rejection. We call this the ``reactance effect{''} of
   translations across highly different contexts. Second, we showcase the
   role of history for translation theory more generally.
   History-particularly the historical relationship between the
   sociocultural categories of the mzungu (Swahili for ``foreigner{''}) and
   the villagers-influenced the way in which the macrocredit idea could be
   introduced to villagers and played a key role in its subsequent
   rejection.},

Abstract = {``There's nothing so practical as a good theory,{''} yet there is
   growing concern that management theory is not very useful or usable.
   Many scholars are seeking to fix the growing disconnect between theory
   and managerial realities, as well as the overabundance of weak and
   untested theory. Our concern is that all this discussion focuses on
   improving ``unit theory,{''} which frames empirical work on specific
   aspects of a phenomenon, rather than ``programmatic theory,{''} which
   orients scholars and practitioners toward what the unit theories
   collectively support as settled science. While programmatic theory must
   be made up of solid unit theories, the processes that improve
   programmatic theory are different from and can be undermined by those
   that improve unit theory. Our contribution, therefore, is a model for
   how unit theory becomes programmatic theory that demonstrates how and
   why programmatic theory needs to drive that process. We conclude by
   using our model to show why the current suggestions for fixing the
   crisis of theory are not only insufficient but even draw away from the
   development of programmatic theory.},

Abstract = {We explore how open theorizing contributes to theory development within

   Open science precepts such as open data and open research material can
   foster open theorizing, enabling loosely coordinated researchers to
   develop theoretical explanations by drawing on one another's data sets,
   code scripts, notes, methodological protocols, auxiliary findings, and
   supplemental documentation. In social scientific, theory-intensive
   fields, such as management and organization studies, open theorizing
   processes can also occur through sharing concepts, framings, theoretical
   relations, and case examples, as well as through research policies and
   debates about values. By enacting the social epistemological principles
   of free criticism and diversity, these processes significantly affect
   theoretical vocabularies, promoting their concentration, extension,
   reinvigoration, and procreation. We examine how open theorizing can
   benefit or hinder theory development, and we discuss the collective
   action problems that may hamper its adoption.},

Abstract = {The need to understand how new ideas and hunches are created that may
   subsequently lead to new theories or models has never been greater for
   academics and practitioners. Abduction provides a mode of reasoning for
   achieving this. It is a form of generative reasoning that begins with
   observing and confirming an anomaly, and generating and evaluating
   hunches that may explain the anomaly, for subsequent deductive
   constructing and inductive testing. Although abductive reasoning is
   being recognized in the management literature, it requires more
   systematic development to be useful for theory creation. We argue that
   abduction can inform management scholars in creating theories in three
   important ways: First, we propose four key steps in abductive reasoning
   of observing and confirming anomalies and generating and evaluating
   hunches. Second, we go beyond individual reasoning to examine collective
   social-psychological processes of generating new theories. Third, we
   propose specific ways for disciplined imagination in abductive
   reasoning.},

   limiting the scope for exploring what is possible and lacking

   can organize to resist and potentially overcome stigmatization
   altogether. Addressing this question empirically, we studied the
   long-term unemployed in Spain using a longitudinal qualitative research
   design. We develop a typology of responses to stigmatization - getting
   stuck, getting by, getting out, getting back at and getting organized -
   that advances our understanding of stigma in several ways. First, our
   typology captures stigma as a multilevel phenomenon. Second, it makes
   explicit that stigma can only be understood in relation to its
   socio-historical contexts and unequal relations of power. Third, it
   captures how resisting stigma needs to be a collective enterprise and
   advances the importance of organizing to both challenge stigmatization
   and explore alternatives.},

Abstract = {Wicked problems are complex and dispersed challenges that go beyond the
   capacity of individual organizations and require a response by multiple
   actors, often in the form of transnational regimes. While research on
   regimes has provided insights into such collective responses, less is
   known about how such regimes may form barriers that hinder and block
   appropriate responses to addressing wicked problems. Exploring the
   problematic role of regime-level responses is timely given that many of
   today's wicked problems are far from being alleviated and in many
   instances appear instead to be intensifying. We draw from complementary
   insights of regime theory and research on institutional barriers to
   explore our research question: How do regimes form barriers to
   addressing wicked problems, and which mechanisms sustain such barriers?
   We explore this question with a longitudinal case study of the
   transnational regime for refugee protection and its response to
   displacement in Rwanda. From our findings, we develop a model of
   dissociation that explains how actors move further away from addressing
   a wicked problem. We identify four dissociative mechanisms (discounting,
   delimiting, separating, and displaying) that each create a distinct
   regime-level barrier. These barriers are distributed and mutually
   reinforcing, which makes it increasingly hard for actors to find
   alternative ways of responding to an escalating problem. Our study
   provides insights for research on regimes and wicked problems as well as
   studies on institutional barriers. We conclude with policy implications
   for overcoming those barriers, in line with the wider concerns and
   motivations of this special issue.},

Abstract = {Greater numbers of women are entering workplaces in Saudi Arabia and
   other Middle Eastern countries. Structural features of patriarchy are
   changing in Middle Eastern societies and workplaces, but women's
   experiences of gendered segregation, under-representation and exclusion
   raise questions around the feminist politics and ethics mobilized to
   respond to them. Building on and extending emerging research on
   feminism, gender, resistance, feminist ethics and the Middle East, we
   use data from an interview study with 58 Saudi Arabian women to explore
   their attitudes toward gender-segregated and mixed workplaces. We
   develop a novel conceptualization of how gender is experienced through
   patternings of resistance and conformity shaped by the ethicopolitical,
   religiopolitical and sociocultural webs of meaning in Saudi society that
   permeate workplaces. Saudi women's attitudes and actions in the
   workplace are neither entirely individual and private nor entirely
   collective and public, but made up of nuanced commitments and
   resistances to context-relevant identity issues. We discuss implications
   of our findings for the feminist ethics and politics of gendered
   resistance and conformity to working practices and norms in Islamic and
   Middle Eastern settings.},

Volume = {60},

Abstract = {We use experimental markets to examine how pushing investment
   information and the value relevance of that information interact to
   influence investors' value estimate accuracy and market price
   efficiency. Developments in technology allow information to be pushed to
   investors anytime and anywhere. However, in addition to value-relevant
   information, pushed information often includes information that is
   irrelevant for assessing firm value. Drawing on psychology theory, we
   find that pushing information has divergent effects depending on the
   value relevance of the information. Pushing only value-relevant
   information increases investors' processing of the information and leads
   to more accurate value estimates and market prices than when not pushed.
   In contrast, pushing a mix of value-relevant and value-irrelevant
   information reduces investors' processing of value-relevant information,
   leading to less accurate value estimates and market prices due to poorer
   acquisition and integration of information than when not pushed or when
   only value-relevant information is pushed. Collectively, our results
   reveal a dark side to push technologies, particularly with the growing
   presence of value-irrelevant information.},

Volume = {27},
Number = {2},
Pages = {668-705},

Abstract = {We investigate whether information transparency at the industry level is
   associated with the sustainability of within-industry differences in
   profitability. Since competition leads to the elimination of
   intra-industry profitability differences, this investigation provides
   evidence on whether competitors act on information about rivals. Using
   an industry-level transparency measure that integrates corporate
   reporting by firm managers, private information search and communication
   by analysts, and information dissemination by the media, we find that
   transparency is associated with faster reductions in within-industry
   profitability differences. Using aggregate financial statement data for
   public and private firms provided by the U.S. Census Bureau, we further
   find that differences in profitability between public and private firms
   are less persistent when public firms' profitability exceeds private
   firms' profitability, consistent with theoretical and anecdotal
   arguments that public firms are at a competitive disadvantage because
   they are required to be more transparent than private counterparts. Our
   results are robust to the use of local newspaper closures and mergers as
   exogenous shocks to transparency. Collectively, these findings indicate
   that information transparency facilitates competition, leading to the
   erosion of profitability differences within an industry. We further
   demonstrate that information transparency is positively associated with
   the degree to which competitors enter or exit an industry in
   anticipation of changes in the industry's profitability outlook.},

Abstract = {We examine whether managers provide more voluntary disclosure when GAAP
   limits their reporting discretion in financial statements. We find
   managers are more likely to disclose non-GAAP earnings, issue more
   management forecasts, and provide longer yet more readable management
   discussion and analysis (MD\&A) disclosures when GAAP limits their
   discretion. These effects are stronger when there is greater demand for
   information and better monitoring. In contrast, these effects are weaker
   when managers have incentives to manage earnings.
   Difference-in-differences analyses around standard changes provide
   further evidence that managers make more non-GAAP adjustments and are
   more likely to discuss the standard and its underlying transaction in
   the MD\&A when a new standard limits their discretion more than its
   predecessor. Collectively, our results suggest managers use voluntary
   disclosure channels to convey information when GAAP limits their ability
   to recognize such information in financial statements.},

Title = {How do most low ETR firms avoid paying taxes?},
Journal = {REVIEW OF ACCOUNTING STUDIES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {27},
Number = {2},
Pages = {570-606},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Evidence suggests a large proportion of profitable U.S. firms have low
   effective tax rates (i.e., an ETR between 0 and 10\%). Despite
   widespread interest in how firms avoid paying taxes, we do not know how
   most firms attain low ETRs and whether they are primarily benefiting
   from benign or aggressive tax positions. Using a research design that
   explicitly examines low ETR firms, we predict and find that the majority
   are primarily benefiting from a benign tax position: large net operating
   loss carryforwards (NOLs). We also find that large NOLs allow firms to
   persistently retain low ETRs year after year. In contrast, we find that
   multinationals and tax haven firms, which should have more opportunities
   for aggressive tax planning, have a lower probability of attaining a low
   ETR (relative to domestic and non-tax haven firms). Collectively, these
   findings suggest that the typical low ETR firm does not incur
   significant tax risk. Consistent with this, we find that low ETR firms
   accrue unrecognized tax benefits at a similar rate as firms that pay the
   statutory tax rate and do not experience higher future tax rate
   volatility. Overall, the results shed light on the profile of the
   average low ETR firm and provide evidence that the majority are
   utilizing large NOLs rather than aggressive tax planning.},

Abstract = {Organizational processes have been widely recognized as both multilevel
   and dynamic, yet traditional methods of measurements limit our ability
   to model and understand such phenomena. Featuring a popular model of
   team processes advanced by Marks et al. (2001), we illustrate a method
   to use individuals' communications as construct valid unobtrusive
   measures of collective constructs occurring over time. Thus, the purpose
   of this investigation is to develop computer-aided text analysis (CATA)
   techniques that can score members' communications into valid team
   process measures. We apply a deductive content validity-based method to
   construct CATA dictionaries for Marks et al.'s dimensions. We then
   demonstrate their convergent validity with subject matter experts'
   (SMEs) hand-coded team communications and different SMEs' behaviorally
   anchored rating scales based on video recordings of team interactions,
   using multitrait-multimethod analyses in two samples. Using a third
   sample of paramedics performing a high-fidelity mass casualty incident
   exercise, we further demonstrate the convergent validity of the CATA and
   SME scorings of communications. We then model the relationships among
   processes across episodes using all three samples. Next, we test
   criterion-related validity using a longitudinal dual-discontinuous
   change growth modeling design featuring the paramedic CATA-scored team
   processes as related to a dynamic performance criterion. Finally, we
   integrate behavioral data from wearable sensor badges to illustrate how
   CATA can be scored at the individual level and then leveraged to model
   dynamic networks of team interactions. Implications, limitations,
   directions for the future research, and guidelines for the application
   of these techniques to other collective constructs are discussed.},

Abstract = {We examine corruption across three Central and Eastern Europe (CEE)
   countries (Hungary, North Macedonia and Slovenia) through a social
   psychology framework which integrates social identity theory, social
   cognitive theory and moral disengagement mechanisms. We illustrate how
   various social identities influence individual and collective action in
   terms of ethical behavior and corruption, thereby creating, maintaining
   and perpetuating petty, grand and systemic public/private corruption
   through triadic co-determination via cognition, behavior and the
   environment. Despite growing research on corruption normalization, less
   is known about the cognitive and behavioral mechanisms in ethical
   decision making, the cognitive workings of how individuals reconcile
   unethical behavior and the social psychological processes behind
   corruption in society and organizations. Expert interviews reveal
   internally conflicted multi-layered social identities perpetuating
   corruption, some embedded in nationalistic history and others tied to
   the European Union, which supports the divergent paths of CEE countries
   since the fall of communism. Some moral disengagement mechanisms are
   common across all three countries, while others are linked to specific
   circumstances. Social identity mechanisms feed into moral disengagement,
   which individuals draw upon to reconcile the conflict between unethical
   behavior and moral codes. Patterns of moral disengagement aggregate to
   the country level and explain normalization of corruption in CEE society
   and organizations.},

Abstract = {This paper explores the implications of a Civil Economy approach to
   consumer ethics, by addressing the idea that Antonio Genovesi's
   (1713-1769) notion of mutual assistance can be understood in terms of
   collective intentionality or team reasoning. I try to give reasons for
   this idea by a careful examination of Genovesi's conception of social
   life and human agency and by reading it through the lens of team
   reasoning. I argue that this understanding of mutual assistance may
   imply broad constraints over agents' choices whenever they conflict with
   the good of society. Then I explore the implications of a mutual
   assistance approach to market ethics in a global society, where
   conflicting views of good and different group affiliations are possible.},

Journal = {MANAGEMENT SCIENCE},

Volume = {67},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {We present evidence that although individuals with accounting expertise
   bring key skills to the financial reporting responsibilities of the
   chief financial officer (CFO) position, they tend to lack educational
   and career experiences relevant to nonaccounting responsibilities (e.g.,
   operations and strategy). Assuming boards' perceptions of CFO accounting
   expertise are correct on average, we provide evidence of tradeoffs of
   CFO accounting expertise by examining how differences in CFO backgrounds
   shape executive employment decisions. Firms with greater demand for
   nonaccounting expertise are less likely to hire an accounting expert
   CFO, consistent with ex ante firm-manager matching. Ex post, significant
   declines in firm-manager fit predict CFO turnover and other compensating
   changes in the composition of the senior management team. Accounting
   expert CFOs are also less likely to become chief executive officers,
   suggesting that CFO experience does not fully mitigate these tradeoffs.
   Collectively, the results suggest important tradeoffs inherent to CFO
   accounting expertise that shape the structure of the senior management
   team.},

Title = {Why Local Adaptation Sometimes Fails to be Effective for MNEs: Exploring
   the Dynamics of Collective Bonuses, Egalitarianism, and Informal Norms},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT STUDIES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {59},
Number = {4},
Pages = {886-924},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Past literature has documented the liability of foreignness (LOF) that
   foreign MNEs face when they introduce organizational practices abroad
   that work well in their home countries, particularly practices that
   conflict with local cultural norms. However, when foreign MNEs adopt
   practices that resemble those of their local counterparts, whether and
   why foreign MNEs still face a LOF is unclear. This study explores why
   foreign MNEs that implement a compensation practice used by local
   counterparts - collective bonuses - may not experience the same
   performance benefits. Our data consists of interviews and longitudinal
   survey data of the organizational practices of MNEs in France, a country
   where commitment to egalitarian resource distribution is culturally
   strong. We find that foreign MNEs, especially those from countries where
   egalitarian commitment is relatively low, benefit significantly less in
   terms of productivity when implementing collective bonuses than do their
   French counterparts. We show how even when foreign MNEs adopt local
   practices, they can subtly transfer the cultures of their home
   countries. In other words, they transfer informal, elusive norms (e.g.,
   non-egalitarian attitudes of top management) that can be problematic.
   Tension persists between the informal requirements to facilitate the
   practice in the host country and the MNE's home-country culture, a core
   part of their tacit knowledge. It is one of the first pieces to show
   that imitating local practices may not suffice to reduce LOF because
   cultural conflicts make such imitation ineffective. Our findings shed
   light on how MNEs' cultural heritage can shape the effectiveness of
   their practices abroad.},

Abstract = {Recent developments in artificial intelligence (AI) have increased
   interest in combining AI with human intelligence to develop superior
   systems that augment human and artificial intelligence. In this paper,
   augmented intelligence informally means computers and humans working

   of the resulting system improves. Intelligence augmentation (IA) can
   pool the joint intelligence of humans and computers to transform
   individual work, organizations, and society. Notably, applications of IA
   are beginning to emerge in several domains, such as cybersecurity,
   privacy, counterterrorism, and healthcare, among others. We provide a
   brief summary of papers in this special section that represent early
   attempts to address some of the rapidly emerging research issues. We
   also present a framework to guide research on IA and advocate for the
   important implications of IA for the future of work, organizations, and

Title = {Emergent Strategy from Spontaneous Anger: Crowd Dynamics in the First 48
   Hours of the Ferguson Shooting},
Journal = {ORGANIZATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {32},
Number = {5},
Pages = {1210-1234},
Month = {SEP-OCT},
Abstract = {The fatal August 9, 2014, officer-involved shooting of a Black teenager
   in Ferguson, Missouri, sparked a series of local protests that
   culminated in a national social movement: Black Lives Matter. In this
   study, through a minute-by-minute analysis of crowd dynamics, I find
   that the eventual social movement strategy emerged from spontaneous acts
   of anger in protest crowds within the first 48 hours of the shooting.
   This finding is surprising in light of social movement scholarship, in
   which strategy is thought to follow from rationality and decision making
   within formal organizations, not emotionality and spontaneous action
   within informal crowds. By coupling a historical analysis of protest and
   policing practices with a comparison of prominent theories of crowds,
   emotion, and strategy, I theorize how strategy can emerge from
   spontaneous acts of anger as part of a distributed sensemaking process
   in crowds, rather than conflating strategy with rationality and
   deliberate planning in organizations. Taken in sum, this study
   challenges prevailing ideas about the wisdom of crowds and exemplifies
   the immanent potential for change, in which our seemingly ``micro{''}
   actions are not trivial but can influence even the most ``macro{''} of
   strategic outcomes.},

Number = {8, SI},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {In this study, we seek to understand the consequences of demographic
   faultlines at the organizational level. Drawing from the faultline and
   cross-categorization literature, we suggest that organizational
   demographic faultlines (based on age and gender) have the potential to
   either reduce or enhance employees' collective organizational
   identification and, thereby, indirectly influence firm performance and
   innovation. Whether organizational demographic faultlines have
   detrimental or beneficial effects depends on the functional
   heterogeneity within faultline-based demographic subgroups, where
   heterogeneity is defined as the extent to which subgroup members belong
   to different functional departments. We theorize that this functional
   heterogeneity alters the degree of social integration between
   demographic subgroups. Results from a multisource field study of
   demographic faultlines among 5,495 employees in 82 small and
   medium-sized firms (<250 employees) support our model. We demonstrate
   that organizational demographic faultlines have important consequences,
   and we show that functional heterogeneity changes whether these
   consequences are negative or positive.},

Title = {Role of Social Media in Social Protest Cycles: A Sociomaterial
   Examination},
Journal = {INFORMATION SYSTEMS RESEARCH},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {32},
Number = {3},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Contemporary social media fueled social protest is self-organized,
   rapidly dynamic, and decentralized, constitutes vast populations, and is
   shaped by multiple and concurrent channels of information flows. Such
   protest activity is captured in the concept of social protest cycles,
   which are short periods of intense and contentious protest activity
   characterized by temporal dynamics, a large repertoire of protest
   action, confrontation and potential violence, and possible institutional
   action. Social protest cycles are the microfoundations of long-term
   social movements. They contain the seeds of potential societal
   transformation because their intense collective action can be
   constructively harnessed toward change. This paper examines the role of
   social media in social protest cycles. Drawing from the theoretical
   concept of sociomaterial assemblages, we conceptualize the social media
   enabled social protest cycle as an assemblage having social (e.g.,
   people, elected leaders, police, judges) and technical (e.g., social
   media applications, online petition applications) components. We analyze
   how the social protest cycle transforms through performative
   intra-actions. The empirical context for the study is a social media
   enabled social protest cycle that emerged after a fatal rape incident in
   New Delhi, India. Data pertaining to the social protest cycle over the
   period December 17-25, 2012, were collected from social media activity
   on Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, online blogs, and newspaper websites.
   Through mixed methods analysis we identify three intra-actions,
   consolidation, expansion, and intensification, and theorize how they
   transform the social protest cycle over time. The paper contributes to
   the information systems literature that studies social media-enabled
   social protest action. As theoretical contributions, it develops (1) the
   notion of intra-actions as organizing mechanisms and (2) a relational
   ontology for social media-enabled social protest action. Through these
   contributions, we suggest that the power of social media lies in its
   socially produced and emergent relationships with other entities in the
   social protest cycle.},

   ongoing interactions can exert different effects on tie formation and
   tie decay. This paper investigates how tie decay and tie formation
   processes differ by focusing on contentious practices. To the extent
   that information about dissimilarities in contentious practices is
   learned through ongoing interactions, it can exert diverging effects on
   tie formation and tie decay. Using a longitudinal data set of 141,543
   physician dyads, we find that differences in contentious prescribing led
   ties to weaken or dissolve altogether but did not affect tie formation.
   The more contentious the practice and the more information available
   about the practice, the stronger the effect on tie decay and
   dissolution. Collectively, these findings contribute to a more nuanced
   understanding of relationship evolution as an unfolding process through
   which deeper-level differences are revealed and shape the outcome of the
   tie.},

Abstract = {We find that mutual funds whose managers are socially connected with
   firm auditors hold more shares of these firms and generate superior
   portfolio returns. Cross-sectional results reveal that the relation
   between social connections and mutual fund stockholdings is more
   pronounced: when the social connections are stronger, when the auditor
   is in a better position or has stronger incentives to acquire private
   information, when the fund manager exercises more power, for small audit
   firms, for auditors in areas with poor investor protection, and for
   public firms with greater business opacity or private information. Other
   results are consistent with fund managers electing to schedule their
   corporate site visits to coincide with the fieldwork of their connected
   auditors, as would be expected if fund managers time their visits to
   meet with these auditors to facilitate information transfer.
   Additionally, we observe associations between fund trading prior to
   earnings surprises and audit opinions, and the presence of social
   connections between fund managers and firm auditors. Finally, we show
   that mutual funds and firms in which they invest tend to appoint
   connected auditors and pay them higher fees. Collectively, we document
   empirical patterns that would arise if socially connected auditors and
   mutual fund managers share information.},

Title = {Building trust through knowledge sharing: Implications for incentive
   system design},
Journal = {ACCOUNTING ORGANIZATIONS AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {93},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {We examine whether knowledge sharing can enhance the efficacy of
   implicit, trust-based incentives. Using a stark laboratory experiment,
   we find support for theory suggesting that individuals believe that
   their knowledge is an important part of their identity, making it costly
   to share, but facilitating greater trust that recipients of this
   knowledge will reciprocate with future rewards. Utilizing participants
   with substantial work experience, results from additional scenario-based
   experiments demonstrate practical implications of this theory.
   Collectively, the results from our experiments show that individuals
   help others less when the help conveys personal knowledge relative to
   when it does not absent the prospect of rewards, but more when they can
   expect future rewards (i.e., with implicit incentives). Importantly,
   knowledge sharing increases the efficacy of implicit incentives more
   when they are determined by the help recipient relative to someone else
   (e.g., a supervisor). Collectively, we contribute to a better
   understanding of incentive systems designed to promote knowledge sharing
   in practice. (c) 2021 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd. This is

Title = {Audit committee members' professional identities: Evidence from the
   field},
Journal = {ACCOUNTING ORGANIZATIONS AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {93},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {We advance social identity theory in the context of corporate governance
   research by evaluating how experiences outside the audit committee (AC)
   relate to AC members' (ACMs') professional identities and how these
   identities then map into ACMs' responsibilities, how ACMs perceive that
   they add value, and how ACMs aid in the resolution of difficult
   judgments and decisions. We identify and evaluate four nonexclusive ACM
   social identities: executive management, financial management,
   investment management, and audit partner. We find that prior experiences
   relate to the social identities with which ACMs identify, yet identities
   also develop without role-relevant experiences. Interpreting the
   interviews leads us to propose a novel theory -mediational activism -a
   hybrid perspective whereby the ACM acts in multiple seemingly
   incongruent modes as a monitor, collaborator, and/or advocate with the
   intent to organize collective understanding, action, and mutually
   equitable outcomes. We find that ACMs' perceptions of their primary
   role-relevant responsibilities are consistent with agency theory and
   extensive mediational activism, while perceptions of value-add are more
   consistent with the theory of resource dependence and reflect the desire
   to leverage prior experiences. Finally, we provide evidence on a host of
   difficult judgments and decisions that ACMs oversee, and find that they
   sometimes use typical negotiation strategies such as contending and
   compromising, but rarely resort to offering concessions. Employing these
   strategies differs based on social identities, but regardless of their
   identities ACMs most commonly approach their oversight role in resolving
   difficult judgments and decisions by adopting a mediational activism
   perspective. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Collective identity is important for the cohesion of social movements,
   yet there is an inherent tension between group unity and heterogeneity
   when multiple groups are motivated to come together to work for change.
   Through a three-year investigation of the early stages of a women's

   of collective identity development. Our findings capture how two
   heterogeneous groups, Libyan locals and Libyan diaspora, interact to
   negotiate and re-negotiate the boundaries of collective identity. We
   find that this process unfolds through an ongoing struggle where the
   point of difference between the groups-their uncommon past-is the
   mechanism first used to ensure inclusion of insiders, and then to
   exclude outsiders from the collective identity. Our paper contributes to
   our understanding of the relational process through which collective
   identity co-evolves, and the challenges faced by heterogeneous groups
   engaging in collective action.},

Abstract = {Does flexible pay increase the gender wage gap? To answer this question,
   we analyze the wages of public school teachers in Wisconsin, where a
   2011 reform allowed school districts to set teachers' pay more flexibly
   and engage in individual negotiations. Using quasi-exogenous variation
   in the timing of the introduction of flexible pay, driven by the
   expiration of preexisting collective-bargaining agreements, we show that
   flexible pay lowered the salaries of women compared with men with the
   same credentials. This gap is larger for younger teachers and smaller
   for teachers working under a female principal or superintendent. Survey
   evidence suggests that the gap is partly driven by women engaging less
   frequently in negotiations over pay, especially when the counterpart is
   a man. The gap is unlikely to be driven by observable gender differences
   in job mobility or teacher ability, although the threat of moving and a
   high demand for male teachers could exacerbate it. Our results suggest
   that pay discretion and wage bargaining are important determinants of
   the gender wage gap and that institutions, such as unions, might help
   narrow this gap.},

Title = {Implementing Environmental and Social Responsibility Programs in Supply
   Networks Through Multiunit Bilateral Negotiation},
Journal = {MANAGEMENT SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {68},
Number = {4},
Pages = {2579-2599},

Abstract = {Involving suppliers deep in the supply chain is critical for the success
   of environmental and social responsibility (ESR) initiatives.
   Administering ESR programs throughout a complex supply network, however,
   is challenging. In this paper, we apply a multiunit bilateral bargaining
   framework to coordinate ESR investments in a general supply network and
   analyze to what extent an ESR initiator should directly engage the
   higher-tier suppliers as opposed to delegating that responsibility to
   the first-tier suppliers. Our bargaining framework not only generalizes
   the conventional Shapley value approach by allowing the flexibility of
   modeling imbalanced power distribution among the firms but also provides
   an explicit way of implementing the resulting gain sharing among the
   firms through negotiated contract terms. We show that the eventual
   structure of ESR negotiation relationships can be derived by finding a
   shortest path tree in the supply network with the arc cost defined as
   the logarithm of the negotiating parties' relative bargaining power.
   These developments allow us to analyze ESR implementation in generally
   extended supply networks. We find that the ESR initiator tends to
   delegate ESR negotiations to a supplier that is strong in negotiations
   with higher-tier suppliers. When the supply network is complex (i.e.,
   wide and deep), directly engaging all suppliers can lead to a larger
   gain by the initiator than fully delegating the negotiations with
   higher-tier suppliers to the first-tier ones. However, as the network
   gets increasingly complex, the ESR initiator tends to directly engage a
   reduced percentage of higher-tier suppliers. We further extend our
   analysis to situations where the ESR relationships are sequentially
   formed in a decentralized manner, where the benefit of ESR depends on
   the collective choice of the firms' investment levels, where multiple
   ESR programs are implemented in the network, and where ESR investments
   depend on the negotiation relationships.},

Title = {Sustaining Effectiveness in Global Teams: The Coevolution of Knowledge
   Management Activities and Technology Affordances},
Journal = {ORGANIZATION SCIENCE},

Volume = {33},
Number = {3},
Pages = {1018-1048},

Abstract = {Despite the dynamic nature of knowledge-related activities and the
   availability of a variety of communication technologies, many global
   teams habitually use technology in the same way across activities.
   However, as teams move through cycles of accumulating, integrating, and
   implementing knowledge, the purposes for communication technologies
   change. Current theorizing and empirical work on team knowledge
   management has yet to develop a dynamic theory that incorporates these
   changes. By conducting a multiwave, mixed method analysis of 48 global
   teams, we develop a theory of how global teams sustain effectiveness
   through technology affordance processes. We found that effective teams
   are those that recognize cues indicating change is necessary and
   coevolve a symbiosis between new activities, new purposes for
   interaction, and new uses of communication technologies. This
   coevolution of purpose with technology use forms new affordances, which
   enable the team to move on to new knowledge management activities and
   sustain effectiveness. Our theory more realistically models the dynamics
   of staying connected while sharing, combining, and implementing
   knowledge across the globe.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ETHICS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {181},
Number = {1},
Pages = {41-56},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The aim of this article is to provide an overview of various discourses
   relevant to developing a construct of collective phronesis, from a
   (neo)-Aristotelian perspective, with implications for professional
   practice in general and business practice and business ethics education
   in particular. Despite the proliferation of interest in practical wisdom
   within business ethics and more general areas of both psychology and
   philosophy, the focus has remained mostly on the construct at the level
   of individual decision-making, as in Aristotle's Nicomachean Ethics.
   However, he also made intriguing remarks about phronesis at the
   collective level in his Politics: remarks that have mostly eluded
   elaboration. The aim of this article is practical and revisionary,
   rather than exegetical and deferential, with respect to Aristotle.
   Nevertheless, just as most of the literature on individual phronesis
   draws on Aristotle's exposition in the Nicomachean Ethics, the obvious
   first port of call for an analysis of collective phronesis is to explore
   the resources handed down to us by Aristotle himself. The lion's share
   of this article is, therefore, devoted to making sense of Aristotle's
   somewhat unsystematic remarks and the lessons we can draw from them
   about collective managerial phronesis and business ethics education.},

Abstract = {The construction of market infrastructure is a key component of market
   formation. In this article, we explore when and how this process leads
   to the fragmentation of a nascent market. We study the emergence of new
   markets in the context of social and impact investing in the United
   Kingdom during the period 1999 to 2019. We identify a recursive process
   of building the cultural and material infrastructure of the market,
   which we label cultural and material scaffolding, that drives collective
   learning by envisioning alternative futures and conducting institutional
   trials. We show how this scaffolding process explains the split between
   the social investment and the impact investment markets, which we
   theorize as market speciation. We identify two scope conditions under
   which we expect speciation to occur: field overlap and material
   anchoring. The paper contributes to the literature on market formation,
   and to the empirical understanding of how social and impact investment

Abstract = {This paper investigates the role of manager perception in proprietary
   disclosure decisions. I find robust evidence that firms with
   overconfident CEOs (managers who are more likely to perceive proprietary
   costs to be lower) provide significantly more narrative R\&D disclosures
   than firms without overconfident CEOs. In cross-sectional analysis, I
   find that this result is driven by observations where proprietary costs
   are more significant and salient. Consistent with R\&D disclosures being
   proprietary, I find that the return on R\&D is significantly lower when
   firms have more R\&D disclosure and that this relation is not impacted
   by the presence of an overconfident CEO except through higher R\&D
   disclosure. Finally, I find no association between having an
   overconfident CEO and nonproprietary disclosure. Collectively, these
   results suggest that manager perception of proprietary costs is an
   important determinant of firms' voluntary proprietary disclosure.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF CONSUMER PSYCHOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {32},
Number = {4},
Pages = {664-671},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Companies often encourage consumers to compare their performance with
   others hoping that a comparison with a superior other will motivate
   consumers in their goal pursuit. However, upward social comparison is
   often more motivating for maximizers than satisficers. In this research,
   we take a closer look at the often understudied satisficers and show
   what types of social comparisons motivate them. Based on the
   accuracy-effort trade-off, we propose that satisficers care less about
   achieving more and focus more on the other side of the
   trade-off-exerting less effort. As a result, a comparison with a
   superior other who uses less input (vs. achieves more output) is more
   motivating for satisficers. Three studies support our prediction.
   Whereas maximizers are motivated by comparing themselves with others who
   achieve more, satisficers are motivated more by superior others who use
   less input. Collectively, these findings suggest a more nuanced
   perspective on satisficers and have implications for both maximizing and
   social comparison literature.},

Year = {2021},
Volume = {67},
Number = {8},
Pages = {5234-5254},

Abstract = {We find that mutual fund investors are more likely to both purchase and
   redeem funds with high idiosyncratic volatility (IV). Investors'
   tendency to purchase high IV funds is largely driven by high IV funds
   having more extreme returns, which increases the salience of the fund.
   Including flexible controls for extreme past returns over multiple
   horizons decreases the effect of IV on new investment, and experimental
   evidence corroborates that increasing the salience of extreme returns
   increases investor demand for IV. Demand for IV is higher among retail
   investors and funds with otherwise lower salience. Collectively, the
   evidence suggests that extreme returns attract investor attention and
   contribute to investors' risk seeking behavior when purchasing mutual
   funds.},

Journal = {ORGANIZATION STUDIES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {43},
Number = {11},
Pages = {1815-1837},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Recent organizational theorizing contends that loosely structured fluid
   social collectives may attain degrees of ``organizationality{''}
   depending on whether or not they achieve certain organization-like
   elements. The organizationality approach offers a compelling account for
   the persistence of fluid social collectives, but the framework could be
   strengthened by moving beyond language-centered explanations and
   including into theorizing a plurality of ``entities{''} that differ in
   ontological status. Based on a case study within the context of a fluid
   user-built recreation space, this study adopts a relational ontology
   viewpoint on materiality to show how dynamic aspects of natural
   elements, expectations, feelings, and the cyclicality of nature can be
   theorized as material, and thus mattering, to organizing processes.
   Findings reveal that the degree of durability of these entities is key
   for understanding interconnected decision-making, identity, and
   ultimately how the fluid collective achieves or degrades
   organizationality.},

Title = {`That's Witchcraft': Community entrepreneuring as a process of
   navigating intra-community tensions through spiritual practices},
Journal = {ORGANIZATION STUDIES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {43},
Number = {2, SI},
Pages = {179-201},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {This paper theorizes the spiritual processes of community
   entrepreneuring as navigating tensions that arise when community-based
   enterprises (CBEs) emerge within communities and generate socio-economic
   inequality. Grounded on an ethnographic study of a dairy CBE in rural
   Malawi, findings reveal that intra-community tensions revolve around the
   occurrence of `bad events' - mysterious tragedies that, among their
   multiple meanings, are also framed as witchcraft. Community members
   prepare for, frame, cope and build collective sustenance from `bad
   events' by intertwining witchcraft and mundane socio-material practices.
   Together, these practices reflect the mystery and the ambiguity that
   surround `bad events' and prevent intra-community tensions from overtly
   erupting. Through witchcraft, intra-community tensions are channelled,
   amplified and tamed cyclically as this process first destabilizes
   community social order and then restabilizes it after partial
   compensation for socio-economic inequality. Generalizing beyond
   witchcraft, this spiritual view of community entrepreneuring enriches
   our understanding of entrepreneuring - meant as organization-creation
   process in an already organized world - in the context of communities.
   Furthermore, it sheds light on the dynamics of socio-economic inequality
   surrounding CBEs, and on how spirituality helps community members to
   cope with inequality and its effects.},

Title = {Do Stronger Wise-Thinking Dispositions Facilitate Auditors' Objective
   Evaluation of Evidence When Assessing and Addressing Fraud Risk?{*}},

Abstract = {The objective evaluation of evidence is imperative for audit
   effectiveness and the proper exercise of professional skepticism.
   However, numerous studies suggest that auditors fail to evaluate
   evidence objectively when assessing or addressing the risk of material
   misstatement due to fraud. We develop theory to predict that auditors do
   evaluate evidence objectively but only when they have stronger
   wise-thinking dispositions (WTDs), a construct that is new to the audit
   literature. We define WTDs as the tendency of individuals to naturally
   engage in the balanced revision of beliefs and doubts about target
   phenomena by thinking openly and reflectively about evidence. We report
   prediction-consistent results from two experiments that measure the
   strength of participants' WTDs and manipulate whether the underlying
   evidence is less or more indicative of fraud. The experimental results
   also document that auditors vary considerably in WTD strength and
   collectively demonstrate the reproducibility of audit judgment-quality
   benefits of stronger WTDs. We further validate the WTD construct in
   auditing using confirmatory bi-factor analyses to show that it has one
   higher-order general factor along with several subfactors. Overall, our
   theory and results advance the literature by identifying WTDs as a
   determinant of auditors' ability to objectively evaluate evidence. In
   addition, our findings have implications for standard setters and audit
   firms as quality control standards and audit working paper review
   processes might benefit from revisions that take into account that
   auditors do not objectively evaluate evidence unless they have stronger
   WTDs.},

Abstract = {What is collective leadership and how is it developed? Despite growing
   interest in collective leadership its definition, and understandings of
   the contextually situated process through which it develops, are
   limited. We draw on a five-year longitudinal study to explain how
   collective leadership develops through ongoing negotiations between
   strategic ambiguity and reification. We delineate between directed work,
   collective work, and collective leadership to bring conceptual and
   definitional clarity to the field. We develop a process model to explain
   how contextual conditions influence the development of collective
   leadership. Introducing the concepts of accommodated divergence,
   directed convergence, and unified divergence we show how
   interorganizational collaborations can move from collective work to
   collective leadership. We argue that `unified divergence' enables us to
   provide a more precise conceptual definition of collective leadership,
   which we define as: the interaction of strategic ambiguity and inward-
   and outward-facing reification practices, resulting in agreed collective
   aims, alignment and coordination of activities, commitment to collective
   success, and the maintenance of divergent perspectives.},

Abstract = {Although the novel coronavirus that has resulted in more than 3 million
   deaths and 140 million cases of infection worldwide has wreaked havoc
   globally, some nations were more successful than others in curbing
   growth in their number of cases, thereby saving lives. In this research
   note, we integrate insights from cross-cultural research with inquiry in
   social psychology and public health literatures to advance a
   theoretically grounded and culturally derived explanation of
   cross-national variance in the growth rate of COVID-19. Our multi-level
   analyses, based on longitudinal time series data from 107 nations, and
   focused on the first 91 days of this pandemic in different nations,
   illustrate the direct and interactive effects of culture. Specifically,
   we find that individualism and uncertainty avoidance have a positive
   impact, while power distance and masculinity have a negative impact, on
   the growth rate of COVID-19 cases. Three-way interaction analyses
   between time, government stringency, and culture indicate that early
   government stringency attenuated pandemic growth, and this attenuation
   effect was more significant in collectivistic than in individualistic
   nations, and in high rather than low power distance nations. Our
   findings provide evidence that can enable policymakers and organizations
   to develop strategies that not only conform to science but that also
   consider the cultural orientation of nations.},

Abstract = {We explore the complexity of salesperson competitiveness and the concept

   corporate sales force to explore alternative financial incentive
   structures facilitating performance across salespeople possessing
   different types of competitiveness. Using a contingency approach to
   leadership behavior and a multilevel field study with salesperson-sales
   manager dyadic data, Study 3 shows that other-oriented competitiveness
   (OOC) and SOC lead to conditionally distinct salesperson behaviors and
   differential performance outcomes. Collectively, the three
   investigations suggest that SOC is a unique construct having important
   sales management and future research implications.},

Abstract = {Digital technologies are reconfiguring organizations and their
   environments. Activities are increasingly distributed across fields and
   coordinated by data, algorithms and machines. This paper investigates
   data objects (objects made of data structured and aggregated under a
   specific template) and their role in structuring fields and field
   practices. It studies programmatic advertising, an automated bidding
   process with hundreds of participants, whereby media spaces are
   auctioned in real time as individual users browse online content. To
   work on such a large scale, programmatic advertising must standardize
   existing field knowledge into data and coordinate collective action
   through objects, algorithms and technologies. This study shows how data,
   data objects and their infrastructures are involved in transforming the
   links between institutions and practice. The makeup and functioning of
   data and data objects reorient existing cognitive, normative and
   regulative structures, constrain the rule of engagement of actors and
   enable field-level autonomous interaction. The datafication of knowledge
   and automation of practices exposed in this paper call for a thorough
   rethinking of existing approaches to the concepts of organizations and

Abstract = {Studies suggest that when a language requires grammatical marking of

   more tax avoidance. Using a large sample of 56,243 firm-year
   observations across 31 countries, we find that tax avoidance is higher
   where FTR in the language is strong. We also find that tax avoidance is
   more prevalent in Swiss regions with strong FTR and in US firms whose
   CEOs were born in countries with strong FTR. Collectively, our evidence
   suggests that costs of tax avoidance can be non-trivial, and that
   linguistically driven time perception helps explain the cross-country
   variation in tax avoidance.},

   (i) the way entrepreneurs enact several aspects of their ventures and

Abstract = {The global COVID-19 pandemic has fundamentally changed the way we live
   and work in the short-term, but history suggests that the crisis may
   also exert deeper, longer-lasting effects. With the aim of providing
   preliminary insight into this possibility, we theoretically construct
   and empirically test hypotheses for how exposure to COVID-19 stimuli
   (e.g., reading or watching media coverage, observing relief efforts)
   relates to the deep-seated values that guide workers' attitudes and
   behaviors. Specifically, we build from prior work to posit that exposure
   to COVID-19 stimuli is positively associated with workers'
   self-transcendent prosocial values, which motivate prosocial behaviors
   directed toward society as a whole (i.e., charitable donations) and
   coworkers (i.e., helping). Extend the extant literature, we further
   argue that exposure to COVID-19 stimuli will be positively associated
   with conservation values emphasizing self-restraint, submission,
   protection of order, and harmony in relations, which in turn influences
   workers' willingness to tolerate mistreatment by authorities (i.e.,
   abusive supervision, authoritarian leadership, exploitation). Evidence
   from 2,929 full-time Chinese employees tracked for nearly 2 months and a
   diverse sample of 310 workers in the United States generally support our
   arguments, but also provide insight into potential cultural nuances.},

Abstract = {We develop a theoretical perspective on how the increasing data
   availability in the digital age affects firms' strategic decisions.
   Specifically, we explore whether, and under which conditions, external
   experts' collective assessment of product-technology domains impacts
   firms' allocation of capital to their strategic business units engaged
   in these domains. Drawing on decision comprehensiveness theory, we
   propose that such expert sentiment has informational value for capital
   allocation decisions, and that this value is contingent on the available
   information's determinacy and quantity. We find evidence for our
   propositions by studying 669 capital allocation decisions made by 85
   pharmaceutical firms from 2005 to 2016, and by using supervised machine
   learning classifiers to analyse expert sentiment in almost 250,000
   articles. Our study contributes to the behavioural theory of the firm by
   showing that, contrary to what scholars traditionally assume, decision
   makers broaden, rather than narrow, their information processing in
   comprehensive information environments.},

Abstract = {We offer a novel perspective on the role of sell-side analysts as
   information intermediaries in capital markets by documenting a flow of
   information in a new direction, namely, from analysts to the firms they
   cover. We use analyst coverage overlaps and patent citations to examine
   analyst-induced information spillovers about technology and industry
   trends. Consistent with analyst coverage-related information flows,
   firms are more likely to cite another firm's patent if that firm is
   covered by the same analyst. The effect varies with analysts'
   specialization, experience, and level of activity. Firms with more
   analyst-based connections to peers also show greater corporate
   innovation. Collectively, our evidence indicates that financial analysts
   not only reduce information asymmetries between firms and capital market
   participants but also facilitate the production of business intelligence
   through feedback and interfirm information spillovers.},

Journal = {ACADEMY OF MANAGEMENT REVIEW},

Volume = {46},
Number = {3},

Abstract = {Understanding the impact that employee job performance has on firm value
   creation and capture has been an enduring challenge. Micro management
   scholarship has focused on employee job performance behavior and rarely
   considered the extent to which value created by employees is actually
   appropriable by the employing firm. Simultaneously, macro management
   scholarship has focused on firm value creation and capture without
   explicit attention to the nature and types of individual job performance
   or collective performance processes within firms. Thus, we conceptually
   integrate strategic management theory on value creation and capture with
   psychological theory on employee job performance and collective
   performance, to propose a theory that explains how and when firms will
   capture value from employee job performance. Heterogeneity in value
   created and captured by employee job performance is affected by two
   broad factors: individual (e.g., the type of job performance) and market
   (e.g., labor market constraints). These insights lead to theoretical and
   practical advances for both micro and macro fields, suggesting that the
   relationship between employee job performance and firm value capture is
   more conditional and context-specific than previously recognized.},

Title = {Short-Termist CEO Compensation in Speculative Markets: A Controlled
   Experiment{*}},
Journal = {CONTEMPORARY ACCOUNTING RESEARCH},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {38},
Number = {3},
Pages = {2105-2156},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Bolton, Scheinkman, and Xiong (2006) model a setting where investors
   disagree and short-sales constraints cause pessimistic views of stock
   prices to be less influential, which leads to speculative stock prices.
   A theoretical implication of the model is that existing shareholders can
   exploit the speculative stock prices by (i) designing managerial
   compensation contracts that encourage short-term performance, and (ii)
   subsequently selling their shares to more optimistic investors. We
   document empirical support for this theory by finding that an exogenous
   removal (Regulation SHO) of short-sales constraints curbs the provision
   of short-term incentives, an effect reflected in longer CEO compensation
   duration. The effect is concentrated among stocks with high investor
   disagreement and short-term-oriented institutional ownership. Consistent
   with prior work, we also find that longer CEO compensation duration
   leads to longer CEO investment horizons, less overinvestment, and less
   earnings management. Collectively, our results speak to the contributing
   role of speculative stock prices in corporate short-termism. Finally,
   our study implies that effective policies to curb corporate
   short-termism should address stock market speculation and promote
   mechanisms that tie executive compensation to longer-term stock price
   performance.},

Title = {Immoral Entrenchment: How Crisis Reverses the Ethical Effects of Moral
   Intensity},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ETHICS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {180},
Number = {1},
Pages = {71-89},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Moral intensity theory is used to explain how characteristics of moral
   issues affect ethical decision-making. According to moral intensity
   theory, individuals and firms will make more ethical decisions when
   moral intensity is present, such as greater negative consequences,
   including harm to customers. However, evidence suggests this does not
   always happen in crisis situations. For example, Fisher Price waited
   until 30 babies died before recalling its Rock'n Play Sleeper in 2019.
   In this article, the concept of immoral entrenchment is introduced to
   address how crises affect the expected firm responses to morally intense
   ethical issues. Immoral entrenchment suggests that firms experience
   threat-rigidity responses to crises that lead to collective moral
   disengagement. Immoral entrenchment results in firms' denial of
   responsibility and unethical behavior, instead of ethical behavior, in
   the face of highly negative consequences. The study in this article
   tests immoral entrenchment in the context of the speed to recall 843
   consumer products. Supplemental qualitative evidence illustrates the
   collective moral disengagement dimension of immoral entrenchment.
   Contributing to the literature on ethics and crisis, the findings
   demonstrate that crises can generate immoral entrenchment in firms,
   which reverses the expected ethical response of those firms to issues
   with high moral intensity.},

Title = {Hype cycles during socio-technical transitions: The dynamics of
   collective expectations about renewable energy in Germany},
Journal = {RESEARCH POLICY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {50},
Number = {9},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The literature on socio-technical change describes the widely
   acknowledged, important roles of collectively shared expectations in
   shaping the trajectories of novel technologies. However, in previous
   studies on these technological expectations, researchers have mainly
   emphasised early innovation stages, paying little attention to
   technologies that have already begun to challenge and transform the
   established socio-technical system. In this study, we use the example of
   the German energy transition to address this gap. By conducting a
   content analysis of nearly 12,000 newspaper articles, we examined the
   nature and dynamics of expectations that were circulating in Germany's
   wider public from 1992 to 2017 regarding wind power, solar
   photovoltaics, and biogas. Our findings reveal patterns of hype and
   disillusionment for all three technologies and illustrate the important
   roles of frame expectations in shaping these hype cycles. Furthermore,
   the findings shed new light on processes that contribute to the
   emergence and dynamics of widely shared expectations and indicate that
   the associated hype patterns are manifestations of unfolding transition
   dynamics rather than the result of frustrated expectations. In
   theoretical terms, we integrated insights from (transition) research on
   discourse and framing into the sociology of expectations, initiating a
   promising dialogue between scholars in these two fields.},

Abstract = {Building on a historical case study on the first two stock exchanges to
   adopt the now globally dominant for-profit organizational form, the
   Stockholm Stock Exchange in 1993 and the Helsinki Stock Exchange in
   1995, we argue that interaction among socially proximate peers
   contributes to pioneering organizational form adoption within an
   industry, particularly when such forms are introduced by established
   organizations. Peer interaction can induce a search for technically
   efficient organizational forms through the sharing of collective
   experiences, the establishment of collective assumptions, and a joint
   search for solutions. Together, these factors contribute to the
   legitimization of novel organizational forms in the local setting before
   the adoption of the first instantiation of those forms. We propose a
   context-sensitive multilevel model of peer-interaction-induced
   pioneering organizational form adoption that considers shared macro
   environmental drivers, idiosyncratic local environmental drivers, and
   peer interaction as central social mediators between the two.},

Abstract = {Why would an academic project incentivized towards scientific
   publications be repurposed to become a medical platform for responsible
   innovation? Patient Innovation, a non-profit medical platform that
   focuses on the sharing and dissemination of innovations to find
   solutions for rare and chronic diseases, was initially set up as an
   academic research project. However, team members reframed their core
   purpose from conducting research on user innovation to providing global
   access to these innovations and creating societal impact. Using a
   framing lens to understand organizational repurposing, we illuminate how
   serendipitous inspiration, moral emotions and the power of socially
   conscious users and catalysts drove this emergent reframing of core
   purpose and develop a model of organizational repurposing. We show how a
   frame drift towards a change in purpose occurs spontaneously in
   interactions, as actors frame and reframe situations and feel inspired
   and morally motivated to transcend their immediate self-interests and
   serve collective goals.},

Title = {The association between supply chain structure and transparency: A
   large-scale empirical study},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {67},
Number = {7},
Pages = {803-827},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {An emerging body of work acknowledges the challenges focal firms face in
   gathering material information about their extended supply chains and
   begins to point to the role of supply chain structure in influencing
   supply chain transparency. Still, large-scale empirical evidence on this
   complex association remains elusive, especially at the supply chain
   level of analysis. We begin to bridge this empirical gap by examining
   whether supply chain structure systematically associates to supply chain
   transparency in the context of the collective public environmental,
   social, and governance (ESG) disclosures made by a focal firm's
   customers, suppliers, and subsuppliers. To shed light on this
   underexplored empirical phenomenon, we gather Bloomberg SPLC data and
   Bloomberg ESG data about 4803 firms and 20,504 contractual ties
   organized in 187 extended supply chains. We find that supply chain
   density positively associates with supply chain transparency, whereas
   supply chain clustering holds a negative association. We also find that
   supply chain geographical heterogeneity positively associates with
   supply chain transparency. Our results significantly expand the
   literature on supply chain transparency and are relevant to supply chain
   professionals because they emphasize the central role of supply chain
   structure in enabling or constraining supply chain transparency.},

Title = {Long waves in the geography of innovation: The rise and decline of
   regional clusters of creativity over time},
Journal = {RESEARCH POLICY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {50},
Number = {9},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {We explain the rise and decline of regional clusters of creativity over
   time. We argue that this dynamic is the result of the interplay of
   individually rational decision-making processes with collective
   externalities of unplanned social encounters; migration to particular
   places at particular times interacts with a preference to engage with
   similar others. This interplay leads to the rise and subsequent decline
   of opportunities for encounters between people who operate in different
   domains, a basic requirement for radical innovative change. The
   consequent decline of formerly innovative regions creates opportunities
   for new innovative regions to emerge. We test this theory using three
   independently curated datasets. The first includes the geocoded places
   and years of the births and deaths of 124,860 notable individuals who
   lived in Europe between 1000 and 1900 CE, used to measure opportunities
   for domain-diverse encounters in regions and regions' time-varying
   attractiveness in global mobility networks. The second and third
   datasets consist of the geocoded locations and founding years of 3,165
   Catholic monasteries and of 16,596 publishing houses. We use these
   organizational innovations as robust, independent indicators for a
   region's capacity to foster incremental and radical change. Our paper
   aims to open a broader social network perspective on the rise and
   decline of regional clusters of creativity over time.},

Title = {Exploring collective consumer innovation in health care: Cases and
   formal modeling},
Journal = {RESEARCH POLICY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {50},
Number = {8},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Research on consumer innovation in health care has shown that patients
   are important sources of new or improved treatments, care services and
   diagnostic tools. This paper points to another hitherto overlooked class
   of consumer innovation in health care, which we call collective consumer
   innovation. These self-organized service innovations emerge under
   regulatory constraints, occur on the system level, are collaborative,
   and tend to cause institutional change. We use historic and contemporary
   cases from the field of health care in order to document the importance
   of collective consumer innovation and devise a model to analyze their
   economic role.
   Collective consumer innovation is more likely under stricter regulation
   and when the production cost disadvantage of consumers vis-`a-vis the
   formal sector is smaller. The role of market size and the scale of
   technological change is more complex. If either is large, innovation
   will be undertaken by the formal sector, while no innovation at all
   takes place if either is small. The model demonstrates that consumer
   innovations can enhance social welfare by improving the tradeoff between
   safety and experimental leeway, though they under certain conditions can
   lower welfare. Empirically, there are numerous cases where collective
   consumer innovations in the form of novel health services, policies and
   governance systems were adapted by public or corporate health care
   providers.},

   designers in creating novel board games},
Journal = {RESEARCH POLICY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {50},
Number = {8},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {This study adds to the literature on household sector (HHS) innovation
   by investigating how user and professional designer teams differ in
   their ability to translate knowledge diversity into collective creative
   output. We test our hypotheses on a unique data set of more than 5,000
   board game design projects conducted by either teams of professional
   game designers or by hobbyist (user) designers. Our study lends support
   for the notion that knowledge diversity is a double-edged sword that has
   opposing effects on the two dimensions of team creativity, novelty and
   usefulness. We argue and find that teams composed of self-rewarded users
   in the household sector are better able than teams of professionals to
   translate the informational benefits of knowledge diversity into novel
   concepts and game designs. Finally, we find that user teams are in
   general more likely to create truly creative (i.e. novel and useful)
   game designs. This particular result emphasizes the relevance of
   research on HHS innovation and shows that user designers from the HHS
   are able to conduct collective development work more effectively than
   teams of professional designers.},

Abstract = {We exploit the expiring nature of hedge fund lockups to create a new
   measure of funding liquidity risk that varies within funds. We find that
   hedge funds with lower funding risk generate higher returns, and this
   effect is driven by their increased exposure to equity-mispricing
   anomalies. Our results are robust to a variety of sampling criteria,
   variable definitions, and control variables. Further, we address
   endogeneity concerns in various ways, including a placebo approach and
   regression discontinuity design. Collectively, our results support a
   causal link between funding risk and the ability of managers to engage
   in risky arbitrage.},

Title = {PERFORMANCE BENEFITS OF RECIPROCAL VICARIOUS LEARNING IN TEAMS},

Volume = {64},

Abstract = {Team members' vicarious learning from other members' knowledge and
   experience is a critical component of learning and performance in
   interdependent team work contexts. Yet, our understanding of vicarious
   learning among individuals in teams is still quite limited, as this
   learning is often oversimplified (as one-way knowledge-sharing) or
   aggregated (as a collective, team-level property), resulting in
   incomplete and inconsistent findings. In this paper, I extend these
   views by exploring the underlying distribution of dyadic vicarious
   learning relationships in teams, specifically using a network approach
   to examine the consequences of reciprocity in team members' vicarious
   learning with one another (i.e., where both individuals in a given dyad
   learn vicariously from each other's knowledge and experience). Using a
   novel method for calculating weighted reciprocity in networks in a study
   of MBA consulting project teams, I demonstrate that greater team
   vicarious learning reciprocity is associated with greater team
   performance, and also moderates the performance consequences of teams'
   external learning efforts, offering a potential reconciliation of
   conflicting results in prior research. In doing so, this paper advances
   research on vicarious learning in teams, while also providing conceptual
   and empirical tools for studying learning and other interpersonal
   workplace interactions from a network perspective.},

Abstract = {Regular for-profit companies might claim social and environmental goals,
   beyond their primary economic objectives, but sustainability-driven
   for-profit hybrids explicitly design and implement their organizational
   activities to pursue social, environmental and economic goals
   equivalently, which typically generates tensions, inherent to their
   hybrid nature. The ability to address these tensions is key to these
   organizations' success, yet the manner in which they do so remains
   poorly understood. In this case-based qualitative study, the authors
   explicate how specific individual and collective practices contribute
   continuously to alleviating hybridity-related tensions among for-profit
   hybrids and allow them to achieve success. With a micro-foundational
   perspective on for-profit hybrids' dynamic capabilities, this study's
   findings identify four central, dynamic capabilities of for-profit
   hybrids, supported by respective sets of micro-foundations. Nine of
   these micro-foundations contribute specifically to addressing central
   tensions, to different extents. This study thus highlights how
   for-profit hybrids embrace hybridity-related tensions to foster the
   creation of sustainable value.},

Abstract = {This paper examines whether investor learning about profitability (i.e.,
   the mean of earnings distribution) leads to persistence in disclosure
   decisions. A repeated single-period model shows that persistent investor
   beliefs about profitability lead to persistent disclosure decisions.
   Using earnings forecast data, I structurally estimate the model and
   perform several counterfactual analyses. I find that, when investors are
   assumed to know profitability, the persistence of management forecast
   decisions significantly declines by 17\%-27\%. About 24\% of firms would
   have disclosed differently, resulting in 3.9\% net change in the amount
   of information (i.e., posterior variance) provided to the capital
   market. Collectively, the results indicate the importance of learning
   profitability in understanding disclosure decisions and the capital
   market consequences of disclosures.},

Volume = {107},
Number = {3},

Abstract = {We present an integrative conceptual review that reconciles the
   organizational support, social exchange, and social support literatures.
   In particular, we argue that the prevailing, singular conceptualization
   of organizational support is misaligned with contemporary perspectives
   on social exchange-which has served as the bedrock for organizational
   support theory since organizational support theory's inception-and is
   inconsistent with the social support literature-which has long
   recognized that support takes several forms. Thus, we draw on both the
   social exchange and social support literatures to develop four unique
   forms of organizational support: Teleological, Personalized,
   Collectivistic, and Monistic Organizational Support. With this enlarged
   framework for understanding organizational support in hand, we then
   detail the various research opportunities that the integration of these
   literatures affords. Specifically, we explain that this framework
   warrants future research related to the development of new measures, the
   differential prediction of outcomes, and the discovery of organizational
   support profiles. We also invoke the social support literature to
   highlight the potential opportunities in applying optimal matching
   theory to organizational support, examining relationships between
   received and perceived organizational support, and identifying the
   consequences of excessive organizational support.},

Pages = {346-369},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The study of first impressions, which consistently demonstrate
   meaningful and surprisingly durable impacts on attitudes, behaviors, and
   cognitions, is pervasive across psychological disciplines. In this
   integrative conceptual review, we focus on first impressions within the
   organizational psychology literature, which have been explored across an
   impressive variety of topical domains (e.g., selection, socialization,
   leader-subordinate relationships, job performance, and teams) though
   largely in fragmented ways. Our review attempts to resolve major
   differences in how researchers have approached first impression effects
   to build consensus on what first impression effects are, how they occur,
   and how long they take to develop. In synthesizing this seemingly
   disparate body of research, we develop an integrative framework of first
   impression effects comprising four fundamental elements-cues, motives,
   processes, and outcomes-that must be considered both individually and
   collectively to understand first impression effects in organizational
   settings in their entirety. Using this framework, we take stock of the
   existing literature and identify important through lines, including the
   focus on displayer- or perceiver-centric effects and whether first
   impression effects are presumed to be biased or valid. Our fundamental
   elements framework can be used to systematically catalog and reconcile
   prior work, as well as develop stronger, more theoretically cohesive
   studies in the future. We outline major implications for theory and
   practice on first impressions in the workplace.},

   among MNEs in exposure to these risks, proposing that information flow

Abstract = {Basu's {[}{''}The Conservatism Principle and the Asymmetric Timeliness
   of Earnings.{''} Journal of Accounting and Economics 24 (1997): 3-37]
   measurement of conditional conservatism as the asymmetric timeliness of
   earnings underlies hundreds of studies. However, many subsequent studies
   cast doubt on the extent to which Basu's measure captures conditional
   conservatism versus statistical biases or alternative constructs
   (collectively, ``biases{''}), thereby questioning the validity of the
   inferences that empirical researchers draw from analyses using the
   measure. We modify Basu's measure in four simple ways to remove these
   biases. Our key modification is the inclusion of interactive controls
   for return variance, a volatility proxy that captures Patatoukas and
   Thomas' {[}{''}More Evidence of Bias in Differential Timeliness
   Estimates of Conditional Conservatism.{''} The Accounting Review 86
   (2011): 1765-1794] return variance effect and various sources of
   economic optionality and adjustment costs. This inclusion captures
   volatility-related effects on both the level of earnings and the
   sensitivity of earnings to returns, and it allows the magnitudes of
   these effects to vary with the sign of returns. We conduct validation
   analyses using placebo-dependent variables, synthetic returns, and
   nonconditionally conservative earnings components that show our modified
   Basu measure is largely free of known biases. We further show that our
   measure is associated with contracting and other economic variables as
   predicted by theory. Our findings suggest that researchers can rely on
   our modified Basu measure to identify the determinants and effects of
   conditional conservatism.},

Title = {The Roar of the Crowd: How Interaction Ritual Chains Create Social
   Atmospheres},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MARKETING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {86},
Number = {3},
Pages = {121-139},

Abstract = {Atmospheres are experiences of place involving transformations of
   consumers' behaviors and emotions. Existing marketing research reveals
   how atmospheric stimuli, service performances, and ritual place-making
   enhance place experiences and create value for firms. Yet it remains
   unclear how shared experiences of atmosphere emerge and intensify among
   groups of people during collective live events. Accordingly, this
   article uses sociological interaction ritual theory to conceptualize
   ``social atmospheres{''}: rapidly changing qualities of place created
   when a shared focus aligns consumers' emotions and behavior, resulting
   in lively expressions of collective effervescence. With data from an
   ethnography of an English Premier League football stadium, the authors
   identify a four-stage process of creating atmospheres in interaction
   ritual chains. This framework goes beyond conventional retail and
   servicescape design by demonstrating that social atmospheres are mobile
   and cocreated between firms and consumers before, during, and after a
   main event. The study also reveals how interaction rituals can be
   disrupted and offers insight as to how firms can balance key tensions in
   creating social atmospheres as a means to enhance customer experiences,
   customer loyalty, and communal place attachments.},

Title = {Shedding Light on the Dark Side of Firm Lobbying: A Customer Perspective},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MARKETING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {86},
Number = {3},
Pages = {79-97},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Firms spend a substantial amount on lobbying-devoting financial
   resources on teams of lobbyists to further their interests among
   regulatory stakeholders. Previous research acknowledges that lobbying
   positively influences firm value, but no studies have examined the
   parallel effects for customers. Building on the attention-based view
   (ABV) of the firm, the authors examine these customer effects. Findings
   reveal that lobbying negatively affects customer satisfaction such that
   the positive relationship between lobbying and firm value is mediated by
   losses to customer satisfaction. These findings suggest a dark side of
   lobbying and challenge current thinking. However, several
   customer-focused moderators attenuate the negative effect of lobbying on
   customer satisfaction, predicted by ABV theory, including the chief
   executive officer's background (marketing vs. other functional area) and
   the firm's strategic use of resources (advertising spending, R\&D
   spending, or lobbying for product market issues). These moderators
   ensure consistency between lobbying and customer priorities or direct
   firm attention toward customers even while firms continue to lobby.
   Finally, the authors verify that lobbying reduces the firm's customer
   focus by measuring this focus directly using text analysis of firm
   communications with shareholders. Collectively, the research provides
   managerial implications for navigating both lobbying activities and
   customer priorities, and public policy implications for lobbying
   disclosure requirements.},

Title = {Under the Umbrella: Goal-Derived Category Construction and Product
   Category Nesting},
Journal = {ADMINISTRATIVE SCIENCE QUARTERLY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {66},
Number = {4},

Abstract = {Categories are organized vertically, with product categories nested
   under larger umbrella categories. Meaning flows from umbrella categories
   to the categories beneath them, such that the construction of a new
   umbrella category can significantly reshape the categorical landscape.
   This paper explores the construction of a new umbrella category and the
   nesting beneath it of a product category. Specifically, we study the
   construction of the Quebec terroir products umbrella category and the
   nesting of the Quebec artisanal cheese product category under this
   umbrella. Our analysis shows that the construction of umbrella
   categories can unfold entirely separately from that of product
   categories and can follow a distinct categorization process. Whereas the
   construction of product categories may be led by entrepreneurs who make
   salient distinctive product attributes, the construction of umbrella
   categories may be led by ``macro actors{''} removed from the market. We
   found that these macro actors followed a goal-derived categorization
   process: they first defined abstract goals and ideals for the umbrella
   category and only subsequently sought to populate it with product
   categories. Among the macro actors involved, the state played a central
   role in defining the meaning of the Quebec terroir category and
   mobilizing other macro actors into the collective project, a finding
   that suggests an expanded role of the state in category construction. We
   also found that market intermediaries are important in the nesting of
   product categories beneath new umbrella categories, notably by
   projecting identities onto producers consistent with the goals of the
   umbrella category. We draw on these findings to develop a process model
   of umbrella category construction and product category nesting.},

Abstract = {We examine social movements that arise from tensions between countries.
   From a neo-institutional view, we posit that social movements targeting
   another country generate powerful pressures on firms doing business with
   the targeted country. Although informal and non-governmental, these
   pressures may coerce firms into curtailing their business activities
   with the targeted country. Empirically, we analyzed the 2012
   anti-Japanese social movement in China using a panel dataset of
   Chinese-listed firms from 2006 to 2017. Through a quasi-experimental
   design and difference-in-difference method, we found that this social
   movement was associated with a significant reduction in Chinese firms'
   import from Japan, as well as export and FDI activities. Furthermore, we
   found that animosity against the targeted country and firms' network
   connectivity exacerbated this effect, while firms' political capital
   weakened it. We also found that the impact of this social movement
   existed for four years after the movement subsided. We contribute by
   showing that social movements have significant impacts on firms'
   international business activities. Firms need to pay attention to
   informal pressures from social movements, and proactively adapt their
   cross-border business activities. In today's digital era, opinions and
   sentiments can quickly snowball into massive collective forces in the
   virtual and actual worlds.},

Abstract = {Virtue accounts of innovation ethics have recognized the virtue of
   creativity as an admirable trait in innovators. However, such accounts
   have not paid sufficient attention to the way creativity functions as a
   collective phenomenon. We propose a collective virtue account to
   supplement existing virtue accounts. We base our account on Kieran's
   definition of creativity as a virtue and distinguish three components in
   it: creative output, mastery and intrinsic motivation. We argue that all
   of these components can meaningfully be attributed to innovation groups.
   This means that we can also attribute the virtue of creativity to group
   agents involved in innovation. Recognizing creativity as a collective
   virtue in innovation is important because it allows for a more accurate
   evaluation of how successful innovation generally happens. The innovator
   who takes a collective virtue account of creativity seriously will give
   attention to the facilitation of an environment where the group can
   flourish collectively, rather than only nurturing the individual genius.},

Year = {2021},

Number = {4},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Research on opportunity evaluation is flourishing but we know little
   about how teams evaluate opportunities rather than individuals.
   Conceptualizing opportunity evaluation as a collective process, we
   develop an agent-based model to investigate how the social cognitive
   mechanisms of team formation affect the ability of entrepreneurial teams
   to choose good opportunities and forgo bad ones. We find that
   opportunity evaluation decisions depend on the cognitive status of the
   lead entrepreneurs who found the team and the team formation strategy
   they use, i.e., whether they select team members based on interpersonal
   similarity (i.e., cognitive homophily) or complementary knowledge (i.e.,
   cognitive heterophily). Moreover, we show that learning moderates the
   effects of team formation on opportunity evaluation. Overall, our work
   provides a new view of opportunity evaluation as a dynamic social
   process contingent upon entrepreneurs' networks and team founders'
   characteristics and their choices of who to turn for judgments of an
   opportunity's potential.},

Abstract = {This counterpoint examines the relevance of Trevino and Doh's proposed
   new discourse-based view of internationalization for the field of
   International Business (IB). Trevino and Doh introduce their framework
   to address gaps in Internationalization Process Theory (IPT), which does
   not account for the underlying processes that lead to the initial
   managerial decision to internationalize. Framing our counterpoint around
   recent debates on how interdisciplinary research fields determine which
   new ideas to adopt, we explore whether the introduction of the
   discourse-based view adds sufficient novelty to justify the risk of
   fragmentation within IB. To stimulate debate around this question, we
   explore a number of issues, such as (1) whether the constructs found in
   the discourse-based view are distinct from pre-existing IB concepts, (2)
   the relative value of isolating the initial decision to internationalize
   within the broader internationalization process, and (3) the degree to
   which Trevino and Doh have isolated discourse as a primary mechanism
   driving the decision to internationalize. We conclude with a call for
   more dialog around the questions of how IB can embrace greater openness
   while still maintaining coherence and advancing collective knowledge.},

Title = {The effects of board expertise-risk misalignment and subsequent
   strategic board reconfiguration on firm performance},
Journal = {STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT JOURNAL},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {42},

Pages = {2162-2191},

Abstract = {Research Summary Boards are unlikely to be effective if they do not have
   sufficient collective expertise to understand, monitor, and address
   future risks. This begs the question, does the board, in fact, have this
   expertise? If not, can they reconfigure their expertise to address those
   risks? Building on agency theory, we analyze the alignment between the
   board's expertise and the firm's future risks, with the expectation that
   board composition will change over time to reflect the firm's future
   risks-strategic reconfiguration. Our results show that misalignment has
   negative implications for firm performance, misalignment also motivates
   appropriate board reconfiguration, and that this reconfiguration
   positively effects firm performance.
   Managerial Summary Our study illustrates the need for board expertise to
   be aligned with firm risks. While there has been increasing pressure for
   firms to assess their directors' expertise (i.e., skill matrices),
   simply identifying expertise which is present or absent does not speak
   to whether that expertise is actually needed (or not) by the firm given
   the risks faced. We analyze boards' collective expertise, compare that
   with the risks that firms are facing, and identify the gaps which may
   detrimentally impact the monitoring ability of the board and cause firm
   performance to suffer. Consequently, understanding the degree of
   (mis)alignment is of paramount importance for boards to be effective
   monitors and positively influence firm performance.},

Abstract = {This study examines how meritocracy as a collective social imaginary
   promoting social justice and fairness reproduces class and caste
   inequalities and fosters ethical violence. We interrogate discourse of
   merit in the narratives of the professional-managerial class-in-making
   at an Indian business school. Empirically, we draw on interviews,
   full-text responses to a qualitative questionnaire, and a student's
   poem. We describe how business school students articulate merit as a
   neoliberal ethic, emphasizing prudential, enterprising attitudes, and
   responsibility. However, this positive, aspirational facade of merit
   masks practices of ethical violence, wherein individuals invoke an
   ethical principle as grounds for moral condemnation and linguistic
   injuries. These practices of ethical violence desubjectify disadvantaged
   students and result in silence as a form of inequality. We contribute to
   organizational research on inequalities by foregrounding ethical
   violence and desubjectification. We detail the possibilities of
   discursive agency in contesting and interrupting ethical violence.},

Journal = {REVIEW OF ACCOUNTING STUDIES},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {26},
Number = {4},
Pages = {1456-1491},

Abstract = {Research suggests that earnings-disclosure-related litigation causes
   managers to reduce subsequent disclosure, perhaps stemming from a belief
   that even their good faith disclosures will cause them trouble. This
   paper considers unexplored dimensions of disclosure and alternative
   channels of disclosure to provide additional evidence that speaks to how
   litigation shapes managers' disclosure strategies. Consistent with
   Skinner (1994)'s classic legal liability hypothesis, we find that, while
   managers reduce and delay forecasts of positive earnings news following
   litigation, they increase the frequency and timeliness of their bad news
   forecasts. Moreover, many managers who were nonguiders prior to facing
   legal scrutiny begin guiding following litigation. Managers also
   maintain (if not increase) the information they provide via press
   releases and during conference calls following litigation. Supporting
   the notion that managers use disclosure to walk down expectations,
   additional analyses document an increase in the likelihood that lawsuit
   firms report earnings that beat consensus forecasts in the post-lawsuit
   period. Collectively, our evidence suggests that following litigation
   managers continue to view disclosure as a valuable tool that shapes
   their firms' information environments and reduces expected legal costs.
   In so doing, it supports an important alternative viewpoint of how firms
   respond to litigation as well as the effectiveness of litigation as a
   disciplining mechanism.},

Title = {The Influence of Nation-Level Institutions on Acquisition Premiums: A
   Cross-Country Comparative Study},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {48},
Number = {4},
Pages = {878-904},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {We build on neo-institutional theory to examine the manner in which
   nation-level institutions systematically affect domestic
   acquisitions-that is, acquisitions involving acquirers and targets from
   the same country. Specifically, we study in what way premiums are
   influenced through a set of cognitive, normative, and regulatory forces.
   In terms of cognitive pressures, we theorize that prior premium
   decisions of industry peers in the same country influence focal
   acquisition premiums, since prior premium decisions serve as reference
   frames for firms. In addition, we posit that normative forces in the
   form of the national cultural values of uncertainty avoidance, future
   orientation, and in-group collectivism affect bid premiums, as these
   factors influence the manner in which firms deal with the uncertainty,
   payoff time, and merger of groups inherent to acquisitions. Furthermore,
   we propose that a country's regulatory pressures through its disclosure
   requirements influence premiums, since they reduce information
   asymmetries and affect a firm's confidence in assessing its potential
   gains from acquisitions. Using a sample of domestic acquisitions, we
   find support for several of the hypotheses. Our work offers a
   cross-country comparative study of how nation-level institutions affect
   domestic bid premiums and makes theoretical contributions to acquisition
   premium research and institutional theory.},

Journal = {HUMAN RELATIONS},

Volume = {75},

Abstract = {Narcissism is widely considered to be a trait that is commonly found in
   leaders, but also a characteristic that is frequently a source of
   problems for their organizations. However, there is accumulating
   consensus in the organizational literature that, rather than a necessary
   evil, narcissism can potentially be a mixed blessing for leaders. The
   present study sets out to reconcile the paradoxical effects of leader
   narcissism by exploring when and how leader narcissism hampers or helps
   follower job performance. Utilizing a social cognitive approach to
   leadership and drawing upon the inferential model of leadership
   perceptions, we propose that leader effectiveness can shape followers'
   dual collective leadership perceptions in response to leader narcissism
   and that these shared perceptions in turn influence follower job
   performance in opposing manners. The results of multi-wave,
   multi-source, and multilevel data showed that when leader narcissism was
   accompanied by low levels of leader effectiveness, followers
   collectively tended to perceive their leaders as being more
   narcissistic. However, when leader narcissism was accompanied by high
   levels of leader effectiveness, followers collectively tended to
   perceive their leaders as more charismatic. Followers' dual collective
   leadership perceptions then mediated the joint effects of leader
   narcissism and leader effectiveness on follower job performance.},

Title = {Value, rent, and profit: A stakeholder resource-based theory},
Journal = {STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT JOURNAL},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {44},
Number = {6, SI},
Pages = {1488-1513},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Research Summary This article goes back to first principles to develop a
   stakeholder resource-based theory grounded in a team production view of
   the firm. First, the firm is conceptualized as a governance structure to
   facilitate stakeholder cooperation in team production and innovation.
   Second, value creation, value appropriation, rent, and profit are
   defined in ways that explicitly acknowledge the collective and dynamic
   nature of value creation. The resulting framework is used to explain how
   economic profit and stakeholder payments emerge in the interplay of
   value creation and appropriation. One fundamental insight is that above
   normal returns to shareholders result from their (privileged) position
   in governance structures, as opposed to a competitive market logic.
   Implications for resource-based theory and the notion of shareholder
   primacy are discussed.
   Managerial Summary How do firms generate profit? And what determines who
   appropriates this profit? These questions are answered by
   conceptualizing the firm as a coalition of stakeholders who provide
   resources to engage in team production and team innovation. Once the
   firm is seen in this way, two fundamental things become clear. First,
   profit is the result of how resource bundles are managed: profit depends
   on management's ability to assemble, develop, and deploy resource
   bundles that are unique in terms of novelty, complementarities, and/or
   scale. Second, appropriation of profit is the result of pure bargaining:
   who appropriates the profit generated by the firm is not determined by
   markets, but depends on the formal and informal governance rules that
   guide the bargaining over profit among the firm's stakeholders.},

Title = {Order from Chaos: How Networked Activists Self-Organize by Creating a

Abstract = {Collectives attempting to self-organize without relying on managerial
   control can leverage open, digital networks to foster information
   exchange and agility. But, as collectives grow, the open boundaries that
   enable the mobilization of participants and rapid exchange of ideas can
   give rise to new organizing challenges that make collective action
   untenable. We examine this tension by exploring how networked activists
   self-organize through open, digital networks to achieve shared aims
   without belonging to a common organization that supports their cause.
   With a seven-year, inductive field and archival study, we capture how
   activists from the Anonymous collective organized 70 protest actions
   while struggling to integrate newcomers and coordinate increasingly
   complex activities. Rather than succumb to chaos or managerial control,
   Anonymous learned to self-organize, gradually abandoning normative forms
   of control in favor of forms of architectural control. By creating a
   participation architecture-a sociotechnical framework that empowered
   technical experts and unobtrusively channeled newcomers to designated
   forums-networked activists enhanced their collective ability to
   coordinate complex, interdependent actions at scale. Our grounded
   theoretical model reveals how the challenges of self-organizing emerge
   with rapid growth and how these can be overcome by configuring
   architectural control.},

Abstract = {Why do the majority of (White) academics within management and
   organization studies (MOS) endorse discourses of equality, diversity and
   inclusion on the one hand yet ignore the epistemic injustice suffered by
   Black scholars on the other? We demonstrate how White supremacy within a
   historically racist academia marginalizes non-White bodies from
   knowledge production and dissemination by embedding epistemic injustice
   in MOS, and diminishing their utility globally. To expose the
   multifaceted harm caused by White supremacy, we reflect on Black
   scholars' experiences of epistemic injustice, conceptualizing their work
   (i.e. Black scholarship) as underpinned by epistemic struggle and
   epistemic survival. We conceptualize epistemic struggle as striving to
   produce and disseminate knowledge in the face of difficulties and
   resistance generated by structural and agential powers. Epistemic
   survival denotes the sustained presence of Black scholarship through
   compromise, collusion and radicalism. Subsequently, we propose
   collective intellectual activism based on cross-racial coalitions to
   eliminate epistemic injustice and locate Black scholarship at the center
   of MOS.},

Volume = {69},
Number = {3},
Pages = {841-858},
Month = {MAY-JUN},
Abstract = {We investigate analytical and empirical properties of the
   Heteroscedastic Exponomial Choice (HEC) model to lay the groundwork for
   its use in theoretical and empirical studies that build demand models on
   a discrete choice foundation. The HEC model generalizes the Exponomial
   Choice (EC) model by including choice-specific variances for the random
   components of utility (the error terms). We show that the HEC model
   inherits some of the properties found in the EC model: closed-form
   choice probabilities, demand elasticities, and consumer surplus; optimal
   monopoly prices that are increasing with ideal utilities in a
   hockey-stick pattern; and unique equilibrium oligopoly prices that are
   easily computed using a series of single-variable equations. However,
   the HEC model has several key differences with the EC model, which show
   that variances matter: the choice probabilities ( market shares) as well
   as equilibrium oligopoly prices are not necessarily increasing with
   ideal utilities; and the new model can include choices with
   deterministic utility or choices with zero probability. However, because
   the HEC model uses more parameters, it is harder to estimate. To justify
   its use, we apply HEC to grocery purchase data for 30 product categories
   and find that it significantly improves model fit and generally improves
   out-of-sample prediction compared with EC. We go on to investigate the
   more nuanced impact of the variance parameters on oligopoly pricing. We
   find that the individual and collective incentives differ in
   equilibrium: firms individually want lower error variability for their
   own product but collectively prefer higher error variability for all
   products-including their own-because higher error variability softens
   the price competition.},

Title = {Popping the Positive Illusion of Financial Responsibility Can Increase

Abstract = {People around the world are not saving enough money. The authors propose
   that one reason people undersave is because they hold the positive
   illusion of being financially responsible. If this conjecture is
   correct, then deflating this inflated self-view may increase saving, as
   people should become motivated to restore perceptions of financial
   responsibility. After establishing that people do hold the illusion of
   financial responsibility, the authors developed an intervention that
   combats this self-enhancing bias by triggering people to recognize their
   frequent engagement in superfluous spending. This superfluous-spender
   intervention increased saving by enhancing people's motivation to
   restore their diminished perceptions of financial responsibility.
   Consistent with theorizing, the intervention increased saving only when
   superfluous spending was under one's control and among those who were
   motivated to perceive themselves as financially responsible. In addition
   to increasing saving in Western countries, the superfluous-spender
   intervention increased saving of earned income and a financial windfall
   over time among chronically poor coffee growers in rural Uganda.
   Collectively, this work shows that people view their financial
   responsibility through rose-colored glasses, which can undermine their
   financial well-being. It also endows stakeholders with a simple,
   practical, and inexpensive intervention that offsets this bias to
   increase personal savings.},

Abstract = {Online communities bring together participants from diverse backgrounds
   and often face challenges in aggregating their opinions. We infer
   lessons from the experience of individual contributors to Wikipedia
   articles about U.S. politics. We identify two factors that cause a
   tendency toward moderation in collective opinion: Either biased
   contributors contribute less, which shifts the composition of
   participants, or biased contributors moderate their own views. Our
   findings show that shifts in the composition of participants account for
   80\%-90\% of the moderation in content. Contributors tend to contribute
   to articles with slants that are opposite their own views. Evidence
   suggests that encountering extreme contributors with an opposite slant
   plays an important role in triggering the composition shift and changing
   views. These findings suggest that collective intelligence becomes more
   trustworthy when mechanisms encourage confrontation between distinct
   viewpoints. They also suggest, cautiously, that managers who aspire to
   produce content ``from all sides{''} should let the most biased
   contributors leave the collective conversation if they can be replaced
   with more moderate voices.},

Abstract = {This article investigates the effects of development projects on
   economic networks. To this end, we study the impact that a randomly
   allocated Community-Driven Development program in The Gambia has on
   economic interactions within rural villages. The program provides an
   exogenous source of variation to village-level stocks of productive
   capital and to village-wide collective activities. Based on detailed
   data on economic and social networks, we find a significant reduction of
   transfers in these networks in treatment villages. Guided by a
   theoretical framework, we investigate several possible mechanisms and
   find evidence that is consistent with two channels. First, the evidence
   points to modest wealth effects and a village-level transformation
   process towards a more formal economy. Second, we also find evidence
   that is consistent with elite capture, favouritism, and unequally
   distributed benefits leading to reductions in social capital and thus
   economic transactions. Overall, our findings suggest changes in networks
   as an avenue through which development interventions may have unintended
   consequences.},

Abstract = {Organizations often learn vicariously by observing what other
   organizations do. Our study examines vicarious learning-related
   communication through which individuals share their observations with
   other organizational members. Most students and members of present-day
   organizations would expect that this communication is driven by a
   prodevelopment logic-that communication serves the purpose of
   organizational improvement and competitiveness. Our unique historical
   evidence on learning-related communication over multiple decades shows
   that the subjective and collective attitude toward prodevelopment
   communication may be ideologically conditioned. Prodevelopment
   communication is the norm in capitalist organizations, but competing
   ideologies may emphasize other goals higher than organizational
   development. Consequently, increasing challenges to capitalism as the
   ideological basis of economic organization can have deep impacts on how
   organizations learn and produce innovations in the future. Copyright (C)

   highlighting how conflicting and thus ambiguous outcomes across multiple
   goals make interpretation a critical aspect of organizational learning
   processes. In early work in the Carnegie tradition, interpretation
   played a role in the demarcation between what constituted success or
   failure on a given outcome metric. However, in March's latter writings,
   learning and decision making produce an arena or even an opportunity for
   generating interpretations and broader meanings regarding roles, values,
   and identities. We explore how the two interpretive approaches in
   March's work play out across three modes of responses to ambiguity.
   First, the process of selfenhancement whereby participants interpret
   conflictual outcomes so that they, the participants, appear in a
   positive light. Second, an explicit political process regarding the
   contestation of how to interpret conflicting outcomes. Third, from the
   perspective of the organizations' literature on wisdom, participants may
   embrace ambiguity either to enhance learning or simply to enrich
   individuals' interpretation of their experiences. Although these three
   modes of response do not offer a complete set of responses for learning
   in a world of ambiguity, they constitute valuable touchstones for the
   perspective we wish to put forward and, collectively, help enrich our
   understanding of the role of learning, ambiguity and interpretation
   within the Carnegie School.},

Month = {MAY-JUN},
Abstract = {Despite growing engagements between firms and nonmarket
   stakeholders-such as local communities and nongovernmental
   organizations-research has yet to examine the emergence of formal
   contracts between them. Given that a very large number of such contracts
   are theoretically possible but only a small number exist, we seek to
   understand what factors explain the use of contracts to govern some
   relationships between firms and nonmarket stakeholders but not others.
   We draw on transaction cost economics to study transactions wherein a
   nonmarket stakeholder provides a firm access to a valuable resource and
   to understand when these transactions are governed by formal contracts.
   We propose that, when a firm makes site-specific investments, a
   stakeholder's use rights to the resource sought by the firm, the
   negative externalities generated by its use, and the stakeholder's
   capacity for collective mobilization increase holdup risk for the firm
   and therefore the probability of a contract. We collect novel data on
   the location of indigenous communities and mines in Canada to identify a
   plausible exhaustive set of indigenous communities ``at risk{''} of
   signing a contract with a mining firm. We test our hypotheses by
   relying, respectively, on historically assigned property rights over
   lands, the mine-community colocation in a watershed and proximity on
   transportation routes, and archival records of community mobilization
   events. We find support for our propositions by examining which of the
   5,342 dyads formed by 459 indigenous communities and 98 firms signed 259
   contracts between 1999 and 2013.},

Pages = {989-1036},

Abstract = {Negotiations over professional boundaries are often contests about
   controlling technical expertise and authority. Less is known about the
   role of moral judgments in such contests because well-trained
   professionals often silence their moral commitments or engage moral
   debates outside the boundaries of their profession. Drawing on an
   ethnographic study of a science laboratory at the forefront of moral
   controversy, this article shows how professionals manage moral
   challenges by reconfiguring their conventional domain of expert
   authority to include moral as well as technical expertise. Scientists
   drew on their plural moral views to develop, apply, and mobilize
   abstract knowledge about morals as resources to claim authority in
   debates over the moral definition of their work. Collective learning and
   collaboration ensured the cohesion of the professional community
   throughout the process of developing authority despite continued moral
   pluralism. By unpacking one mechanism for the pursuit of moral
   authority, the study elaborates our understanding of the moral
   foundations of professionalism and of the emergence of morally complex
   work activities.},

Abstract = {We examine whether resource adjustment costs, such as installation and
   disposal costs for fixed assets, or hiring and firing costs for
   employees, impede value creation in mergers and acquisitions (M\&A). We
   focus on M\&A deals because they are major corporate investment
   decisions. As a proxy for adjustment costs, we use a firm-level measure
   of cost stickiness. We predict that acquirers with high adjustment costs
   have less flexibility in restructuring resources following the
   acquisition and will find it more costly to merge the target firm's
   operations. Consistent with this prediction, we find that the acquirer's
   adjustment costs are negatively associated with abnormal returns around
   the acquisition announcement. Additionally, adjustment costs are also
   negatively associated with deal synergies. Relatedly, we find that
   acquirers with high adjustment costs purchase targets with high
   adjustment costs. In accordance with this finding, we show that
   acquirers with high adjustment costs purchase intangible-intensive
   targets. Collectively, our results highlight the important implication
   of adjustment costs in M\&A deals for managers and capital market
   participants.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {48},
Number = {4, SI},
Pages = {541-561},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The most consequential consideration of brands arises during
   preferential decision-making. This article proposes that as a
   consequence of the repeated pairing of brands and preferential
   decisions, exposure to brands initiates a cognitive state of readiness
   for preferential decisions (which we term decision readiness) that
   subsequently makes preferential decisions easier. Using both real and
   fictitious brands across a variety of choice contexts, seven experiments
   demonstrate that consumers find preferential decision-making easier when
   it occurs in the presence (vs. absence) of brands. Consistent with the
   details of our framework, this effect: (i) is explained by the
   activation of decision readiness, (ii) leads to outcomes such as
   increased outcome satisfaction and decreased decision delegation, and
   (iii) is attenuated when exposure is to only one brand. Collectively,
   these findings demonstrate the importance of exposure to brands for
   decision-making which, in turn, offers novel insight into existing
   literatures on brand exposure, decision difficulty, and brand roles.},

Journal = {HUMAN RELATIONS},

Volume = {75},

Abstract = {Policies can fail when frontline staff feel they have limited influence
   on policy implementation (powerlessness) or that policy has little or no
   personal meaning (meaninglessness) - they become alienated from the
   policy - but how does this alienation develop? In this article we ask
   whether policy alienation might be viewed as a process that develops
   over time: a process that ebbs and flows, interacting with the policy
   landscape as it shifts, rather than a psychological state. Feelings of
   alienation can be shared across groups of actors, as they collectively
   shift and initiate change. This study uses participant observation and
   interviews with front-line employees as they navigate a UK government
   policy introducing telehealthcare to improve health management of
   patients with chronic conditions. We find that: (i) cumulative
   misalignment between different policy implementation contexts allows
   policy alienation to develop over time; (ii) the shared experience of
   alienation in co-worker groups contributes to further misalignment; and
   (iii) front-line staff use their discretion to respond to policy
   alienation, which has the power to enhance or destroy policy
   implementation. We offer an alternative perspective for understanding
   how policy alienation can be prevented and policy implementation can be
   enhanced.},

Abstract = {Prior research finds that women receive lower salaries than men.
   Similarly, we show that female audit partners in Belgium receive
   significantly lower compensation than male partners. However, there are
   alternative explanations for the pay gap other than gender
   discrimination. For example, the gap in compensation could reflect that
   men are paid more because they have higher levels of productivity. We
   provide new predictions and tests of gender discrimination by comparing
   the fees generated by audit partners (a measure of partner productivity)
   and the types of clients assigned to partners. Consistent with our
   prediction of female partners having to meet higher performance
   thresholds than male partners, we show that female partners generate
   larger fee premiums, but they are less likely to be assigned to
   prestigious clients. To test whether these patterns are attributable to
   gender discrimination, we examine whether the results are stronger in
   male-dominated offices, because this is where we would expect to find
   the most discrimination against women. We find the fee premiums
   generated by female partners are larger in male-dominated offices, while
   the negative association between prestigious clients and female partners
   is stronger in male-dominated offices. Collectively, our combined
   predictions and tests are consistent with female partners facing gender
   discrimination in audit offices that are dominated by male partners.},

Abstract = {How do labor organizations with a movement orientation arise in an
   authoritarian regime? How do they organize workers collectively in a
   repressive society? What movement roles do they play? What challenges do
   they face? To answer these questions, I use synthesized social movement
   theories to examine movement-oriented labor non-governmental
   organizations in China. Based on qualitative data collected through
   triangulated sources, I find that movement-oriented labor
   non-governmental organizations use political opportunities to promote
   one type of modular collective labor action, which consists of three
   tactics, namely the election of worker representatives, collective
   negotiation, and protest. They guide workers to build mobilizing and
   connective structures, formulate collective action frames, and amass
   movement resources. However, the movement roles of this type of labor
   non-governmental organization have weakened, owing to diminishing
   political opportunities caused by changes in government administration.
   This research contributes to our understanding of social movement
   theories, labor organizations in China, labor non-governmental
   organizations and worker centers generally, and state-society relations
   in non-democracies.},

Abstract = {The authors study the phenomenon of strategic group polarization, in
   which members take more extreme actions than their preferences. The
   analysis is relevant for a broad range of formal and informal group
   settings, including social media, online platforms, sales teams,
   corporate and academic committees, and political action committees. In
   the model, agents with private preferences choose a public action (voice
   opinions), and the mean of their actions represents the group's realized
   outcome. The agents face a trade-off between influencing the group
   decision and truth-telling. In a simultaneous-move game, agents
   strategically shade their actions toward the extreme. The strategic
   group influence motive can create substantial polarization in actions
   and group decisions even when the preferences are relatively moderate.
   Compared with a simultaneous game, a randomized-sequential-actions game
   lowers polarization when agents' preferences are relatively similar.
   Sequential actions can even lead to moderation if the later agents have
   moderate preferences. Endogenizing the order of moves (through a
   first-price sealed-bid auction) always increases polarization, but it is
   also welfare enhancing. These findings can help group leaders, firms,
   and platforms design mechanisms that moderate polarization, such as the
   choice of speaking order, the group size, and the knowledge members have
   of others' preferences and actions.},

Abstract = {This paper examines the effect of languages on corporate tax avoidance.
   We hypothesize and find that managers of firms in countries with
   languages that grammatically distinguish the future from the present
   (languages with a strong future time reference or FTR) perceive the
   potential future tax repayments and penalties to be more distant and
   therefore engage in more tax avoidance. Further tests exploiting the
   variation in language FTR within Switzerland and Belgium, which have
   different official languages in different regions but a single tax
   system, suggest that our findings are not driven by country-level
   differences in the tax system. We also provide evidence that U.S. firms
   with CEOs born in countries with strong FTR languages avoid more taxes
   than those with CEOs born in weak FTR countries, indicating that it is
   the CEO's native tongue that affects tax avoidance. Collectively, our
   findings highlight the importance of social norms in understanding
   corporate tax strategies.},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Recent literature shows that the spike in uncertainty during political
   elections harms firms' investment. Bridging insights from international
   business and political science, we argue that the effect of political
   elections on firms' investment activities is contingent on the country's
   electoral system. In particular, we expect the negative effect of
   elections on corporate investment to be smaller for firms operating in
   plurality systems. We test our theory using a panel dataset of listed
   firms around the world, and a panel of US multinationals. Our results
   confirm that during an election period, firms in countries with a
   plurality system reduce investment less than firms in other countries.
   Additionally, we show that multinationals' foreign investment is
   affected by elections abroad: their investment in a host country
   declines during an election in that country, though to a lesser extent
   if the election is held with a plurality system. Collectively, our
   findings provide new evidence on the role of political institutions for
   firms' investment decisions.},

Title = {Resources for What? Understanding Performance in the Resource-Based View
   and Strategic Human Capital Resource Literatures},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT},

Volume = {47},
Number = {7, SI},
Pages = {1771-1786},

Abstract = {Barney's presentation of the resource-based view (RBV) profoundly shaped
   the trajectory of management scholarship. This article considers the
   RBV's impact specifically on the field of strategic human capital
   resources. Although Barney is still highly relevant, I suggest that
   research has not sufficiently appreciated the role that individual and
   collective performance behavior and outcomes play in linking human
   capital resources to competitive advantage. An alternative, what might
   be called RBV2.0, posits that research needs to recognize that human
   capital resources are distinct from performance behavior and outcomes.
   Such an observation raises the question, ``Resources for what?{''}
   Answering this question leads to several important insights. First, a
   given type of human capital resource is only important to the extent it
   is related to performance behavior and outcomes that contribute to
   competitive advantage. Second, performance behavior is largely
   strategy-specific and thus firm-specific. Third, firm specificity is not
   a characteristic of human capital resources but rather a function of the
   proximity of the resource to firm-specific performance behavior and
   outcomes. Consequently, ``Performance{''} is the answer to the question,
   ``Resources for what?{''} This emphasis on understanding human capital
   resource-performance relationships adds considerable precision into the
   RBV, helps resolve puzzles in the strategic human capital literature
   relating to firm specificity and performance mobility, and promotes a
   deeper understanding hiding latent within Barney's original view.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF ACCOUNTING RESEARCH},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {59},
Number = {2},
Pages = {613-655},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {We hypothesize that, in weak-institution countries, firms adjust the
   `timing' of dividend payments by committing to distribute a percentage
   of current earnings as dividends, revealing the extent of firm-level
   agency conflicts to future investors and facilitating the raising of
   external capital. Consistent with this hypothesis, we find that, on
   average, firms in weak-institution countries have a higher speed of
   adjustment (SOA) to their target payout ratio, pay dividends earlier in
   the life cycle, and are more likely to disclose a dividend policy
   committing to pay a minimum percentage of earnings. Within-country tests
   show that, in weak-institution countries, the firms with the highest SOA
   dividend policies have fewer agency problems and an increased ability to
   raise external capital. Finally, returns tests around earnings
   announcements show that high-SOA dividend policies are associated with
   larger market reactions to earnings in weak-institution countries.
   Collectively, our findings suggest that dividend policy helps to
   alleviate agency conflicts in weak-institution countries between firms
   and (future) investors.},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {What is the impact of rhetorical history on employees? We address this
   question by interviewing 29 workers in two organizations. Our critical
   interpretation of the findings suggests that managers willfully craft
   historical narratives to regulate workers' identity and, ultimately,
   advance the organization's agenda. Managers achieve this by peddling
   historical narratives that instill certain logics in workers. These
   logics, in turn, influence workers' identification and involvement with
   the organization. The first logic, reflected glory, exploits the idea
   that what is historical is prestigious and coaxes workers into basking
   in their organization's historical glory through identification. The
   second logic, preservation, exploits the idea that what is historical
   must be preserved and urges workers to be involved in their work to
   stave off the demise of the organization's legacy. We further contend
   that organizations reinforce these logics using narrative
   resources-concepts that lend historical narratives more
   persuasiveness-such as place or longevity. Nevertheless, workers do not
   remain passive. While some engage in traditional resistance tactics,
   others leverage their collective memory as a counter-narrative to the
   organization's narratives. While much has been said about the strategic
   uses of rhetorical history, we conclude by discussing its limitations
   and hitherto overlooked moral implications.},

Volume = {64},

Abstract = {Building on uncertainty management theory, we develop and test a model
   explicating how and when secrecy in pay communication may affect
   employee turnover-related outcomes (i.e., employee turnover intentions
   and firm voluntary turnover rates). Underlying this model is the notion
   that employees triangulate perceptions of pay secrecy (i.e., a
   pay-related procedural justice cue that also reflects uncertainty) with
   their own or others' perceptions of distributive justice as a basis for
   assessing organizational trustworthiness, with the latter serving as an
   important driver of voluntary turnover intentions and behavior. Results
   of two studies (Study 1 at the individual level and Study 2 at the firm
   level) indicate that, rather than being universal, the relationship
   between pay secrecy and turnover is contingent upon perceptions of
   distributive justice, with turnover intentions (at the individual level
   via organizational trustworthiness) and voluntary turnover rates (at the
   firm level) differentially affected by pay secrecy under conditions of
   higher and lower levels of distributive justice. These findings suggest
   an important extension to organizational justice theories; namely that,
   when procedural justice cues are confounded with uncertainty (as they
   are with pay secrecy), the assumed compounding interaction between
   procedural and distributive justice cues may be replaced by a more
   antagonistic interaction.},

Abstract = {Linguistics research shows that languages differ as to how they
   differentiate future from present events. Economics research finds that
   when the grammatical structure of a language disassociates the future
   from the present, speakers of the language also disassociate the future
   from the present in their behaviors. This study examines how
   linguistically induced time perception relates to cross-country
   variation in investment efficiency. We find that underinvestment is less
   prevalent in countries where there is a weaker time disassociation in
   the language. The results from both a within-country analysis based on
   firms headquartered in different regions of Switzerland and an analysis
   based on the birthplace information of U.S. firms? chief executive
   officers confirm the relation between languages and investment
   efficiency. Collectively, the results suggest that time encoding in
   languages influences speakers? cognition and their investment decisions.},

Abstract = {We examine whether economic conditions have a long-term impact on the

   that financial advisors who start their career in recessions are less

   compared with their colleagues working in the same firm, at the same
   location, and at the same point in time. We show that this relation
   between early economic conditions and advisor misconduct remains after
   controlling for differences in hiring firms, advisor characteristics,
   and opportunities to commit misconduct. Collectively, our evidence

Volume = {64},

Abstract = {Social movement scholars have typically focused either on how social
   movements strategically use collective action frames to confront targets
   and mobilize supporters or on how targets respond to social movements.
   Few have captured the interactional dynamics between the two. This
   oversight tends to obscure how an extant collective action frame may
   shift or how a new one may arise during such interactions. To address
   this issue, we focus on movement-target interactions and illuminate the
   microfoundations of framing that produce a new collective action frame.
   Drawing on real-time participant observations, we examine how an
   unintended collective action frame emerged and escalated during a
   year-long interaction between the Occupy London movement and St. Paul's
   Cathedral, Church of England. Occupy protesters shifted from a
   ``capitalism is crisis{''} frame targeting the U.K.'s financial
   establishment to a ``what would Jesus do?{''} frame targeting the Church
   of England. We develop a process model based on the interplay of frame
   laminations and three situational mechanisms-emotional attachment to a
   frame, frame sacralization, and frame amplification-derived from an
   analysis of framing in movement-target interactions to explain the
   emergence and escalation of an unexpected collective action frame.},

Title = {Making the World a Better Place: How Crowdfunding Increases Consumer
   Demand for Social-Good Products},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {58},
Number = {2},
Pages = {363-376},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Crowdfunding has emerged as an alternative means of financing new
   ventures wherein a large number of individuals collectively back a
   project. This research specifically examines reward-based crowdfunding,
   in which those who take part in the crowdfunding process receive the new
   product for which funding is sought in return for their financial
   support. This work illustrates that consumers make fundamentally
   different decisions when considering whether to contribute their money
   to crowdfund versus purchase a product. Six studies demonstrate that
   compared with a traditional purchase, crowdfunding more strongly
   activates an interdependent mindset and, as a result, increases consumer
   demand for social-good products (i.e., products with positive social
   and/or environmental impact). The research further highlights that an
   active involvement in the crowdfunding process is necessary to increase
   demand for social-good products: when a previously crowdfunded product
   is already to market, the effect is eliminated. Finally, it is
   demonstrated that crowdfunding participants exhibit an increased demand
   for social-good products only when collective efficacy (i.e., one's
   belief in the collective's ability to bring about change) is high.},

   Governance of Digital Technology for Mutually Beneficial Role
   Reconfiguration in Organizations},
Journal = {ORGANIZATION SCIENCE},

Volume = {33},

Abstract = {This 1.5-year ethnographic study of a U.S. medical center shows that
   avoiding loss of autonomy and work intensification for less powerful
   actors during digital technology introduction and integration presents a
   multisited collective action challenge. I found that technology-related
   participation problems, threshold problems, and free rider problems may
   arise during digital technology introduction and integration that enable
   loss of autonomy and work intensification for less powerful actors.
   However, the emergence of new triangles of power allows for novel
   coalitions between less powerful actors and newly powerful third-party
   actors that can help mitigate this problem. I extend the political
   science perspective of experimentalist governance to examine how a
   digital technology focused, iterative collective action process of local
   experimentation followed by central revision can facilitate mutually
   beneficial role reconfiguration during digital technology introduction
   and integration. In experimentalist governance of digital technology,
   local units are given discretion to adapt digital technologies to their
   specific contexts. A central unit composed of diverse actors then
   reviews progress across local units integrating similar digital
   technology to negotiate a new shared understanding of mutually
   beneficial technology-related tasks for each group of actors. The
   central unit modifies both local routines and the technology itself in
   response to problems and possibilities revealed by the central revision
   process, and the cycle repeats. Here, accomplishing mutually beneficial
   role reconfiguration occurs through an experimentalist, collective
   action process rather than through a labor-management bargaining process
   or a professional-led tuning process.},

Abstract = {Does empathy merely take place in leaders' minds? How does it help us

   philosophy to communication, the article first offers a constructionist
   view of empathy, based on which empathic leadership practice is
   conceptualized. The article explicates how leadership practice of
   empathy construction is rooted in relational ethics and takes place in
   both synchronic dyadic interaction through conversation as well as
   diachronic narrative practice with a collective other. By
   conceptualizing empathic leadership practice through a social

Abstract = {Grand societal challenges such as forced displacement are extreme and
   complex issues that are challenging to individuals and might seem
   insurmountable. How do local actors make sense of, position themselves
   in and act on such challenges? We conducted a case study of the
   collective sensemaking narratives of 71 actors involved in the refugee
   crisis on Lesbos, Greece. We elaborate how actors make sense of their
   role in the local response to this grand challenge and explain why some
   ultimately chose to cooperate to address the plight of refugees while
   others distributed tasks or avoided responding altogether. We identify
   three collective sensemaking narratives that actors use to validate such
   action strategies aimed at alleviation, personal recovery or structural
   change; and as characterized by different forms of interaction and
   emergent collective sensemaking. We contribute with our article to the
   study of responses to grand challenges by showing how a collective
   sensemaking framework can be used to understand local responses. We also
   contribute to extant theorizing on collective sensemaking by showing how
   actors make sense of grand challenges through interactions with other

Abstract = {Heirlooms are often created out of objects laden with sentimental value.
   This research asks whether specific subtypes of sentimental value are
   stronger catalysts for heirloom creation than others. We find that
   objects associated with achievements are perceived to be more suitable
   as heirlooms than those associated with enjoyment, even when controlling
   for the overall positivity of the association. Process evidence suggests
   this happens because heirloom creators (i.e., givers) have a primary
   motive to inspire their offspring to strive for accomplishments in their
   own right. In this regard, such heirlooms appear to be less about
   creators ensuring their personal achievement legacies are never
   forgotten, but more about creators leveraging their achievements to
   motivate the creation of larger, collective legacies by their families
   by those in following generations. Such findings have implications for
   both firms wishing to extend the life of the objects they produce and
   heirloom recipients who may stronger connect with the underlying
   intentions of the original possessing ancestors.},

Abstract = {Research has demonstrated how ignorance is made, manipulated and called
   upon; how it is the result of strategies, activities and structures.
   This article extends the literature on ignorance by exploring actors'
   own explanations of their self-inflicted ignorance following acts of
   ignoring. By means of a case analysis, we explore how actors explain and
   justify ignoring data they themselves produced. We provide a
   multifaceted model of how ignoring actors' own rationales, facilitated
   by contextual conditions, enables persistent acts of ignoring the
   content and dysfunction of collectively upheld systems. We contribute to
   the understanding of ignorance by demonstrating how self-inflicted
   ignorance is made possible by the combination of ignoring rationales and
   their facilitators, which configures buffers against knowledge-seeking
   efforts.},

Abstract = {This paper highlights the dark side of power imbalance regarding its
   consequences in agri-food supplier-buyer relationships. We report on
   findings from two studies. The first study is based on a sample of 105
   key informants, while study 2 is based on a sample of 444 key
   informants, all from the cocoa agri-food supply market of Ghana. While
   the first study focuses on the antecedents of power imbalance and its
   consequences, the second study explores the role of
   cooperatives/collective action in minimizing supplier exploitation. Data
   from these studies were analysed using the partial least squares
   technique (SmartPLS). Analysis of these findings shows switching costs'
   impact on power imbalance to be curvilinear, while power imbalance has a
   curvilinear relationship with opportunism. The negative consequences of
   power imbalance are further exacerbated by dependency and the lack of
   joint action. Furthermore, we found the negative impact of power
   imbalance on financial performance to be stronger for non-cooperative
   members than for cooperative members, while, counterintuitively, we
   found the positive impact of economic satisfaction on financial
   performance to be stronger for non-cooperative members than for
   cooperative members.},

Abstract = {Humility is increasingly recognized as an essential attribute for
   individuals at top management levels to build successful organizations.
   However, research on CEO humility has focused on how humble chief
   executive officers (CEOs) shape collective perceptions through their
   interactions and behaviors with other organizational members while
   overlooking CEOs' critical role in making strategic decisions. We
   address this unexplored aspect of CEO humility by proposing that humble
   CEOs influence decision-making decentralization at the top management
   team (TMT) and subsequently promote an organizational ethical culture.
   Using a sample of CEOs and TMT members from 120 small- and medium-sized
   enterprises, we find strong support for our hypotheses. We discuss
   important implications for research on CEO humility and strategic
   leadership.},

Abstract = {Consumer feedback platforms offer consumers tools to provide feedback on
   their market and consumption experiences. Beyond broad prior
   characterizations, little is known about the specific means by which
   platforms affect empowerment. Elements of empowerment identified in
   extant studies include voice, choice, justice, inclusion, catalysis, and
   consciousness-raising. We research a popular Brazilian platform to learn
   how platforms facilitate and constrain consumer empowerment. Our
   approach is immersive, a more-than-human netnography of the platform
   involving depth interviews with twenty-one of its consumer and corporate
   users. Findings show same-side and cross-side network effects driving
   the ability of the platform to offer consumers empowerment. Furthermore,
   affordances are critically important. Affordances provide opportunities
   for consumer choice, voice, justice, and inclusion. However, platforms'
   cross-side network effects create economic considerations that limit
   those opportunities in theoretically and practically important ways.
   Although other feedback platforms might offer catalysis and
   consciousness-raising elements of empowerment, our focal platform does
   not. Earlier studies of consumer empowerment on the Internet may have
   been overly general and exuberant because they failed to recognize the
   constraining impacts of network effects, affordances, and algorithms.
   Consumer-citizenry, collective action, and consumer power are thoroughly
   transformed in the age of the platform, opening up new spaces for
   further investigation.},

Abstract = {It is widely believed that ride sharing, the practice of sharing a car
   such that more than one person travels in the car during a journey, has
   the potential to significantly reduce traffic by filling up cars more
   efficiently. We introduce a model in which individuals may share rides
   for a certain fee, paid by the rider(s) to the driver through a
   ride-sharing platform. Collective decision making is modeled as an
   anonymous nonatomic game with a finite set of strategies and payoff
   functions among individuals who are heterogeneous in their income. We
   examine how ride sharing is organized and how traffic and ownership are
   affected if a platform, which chooses the seat rental price to maximize
   either revenue or welfare, is introduced to a population. We find that
   the ratio of ownership to usage costs determines how ride sharing is
   organized. If this ratio is low, ride sharing is offered as a
   peer-to-peer (P2P) service, and if this ratio is high, ride sharing is
   offered as a business-to-customer (B2C) service. In the P2P case, rides
   are initiated by drivers only when the drivers need to fulfill their own
   transportation requirements. In the B2C case, cars are driven all the
   time by full-time drivers taking rides even if these are not motivated
   by their private needs. We show that, although the introduction of ride
   sharing may reduce car ownership, it can lead to an increase in traffic.
   We also show that traffic and ownership may increase as the ownership
   cost increases and that a revenue-maximizing platform might prefer a
   situation in which cars are driven with only a few seats occupied,
   causing high traffic. We contrast these results with those obtained for
   a social welfare-maximizing platform.},

Title = {When Cause-Marketing Backfires: Differential Effects of One-for-One
   Promotions on Hedonic and Utilitarian Products},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CONSUMER PSYCHOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {31},
Number = {3, SI},
Pages = {532-550},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {A remarkable cause-marketing (CM) strategy has emerged in the
   marketplace: businesses promise to donate an identical product for each
   product sold (i.e., a ``one-for-one{''} promotion). Yet despite
   prosocial tendencies, consumers hesitate when uncertain about others'
   preferences, which poses the question of whether one-for-one promotions
   are perceived to meet recipients' preferences. Five experiments (one
   field experiment and four laboratory experiments) reveal that the
   efficacy of in-kind, one-for-one promotions varies as a function of
   product type. Specifically, one-for-one promotions enhance purchase
   intentions for utilitarian products but undermine purchase intentions
   for hedonic products. Moreover, this difference is due to certainty
   regarding recipients' utilitarian preferences and uncertainty regarding
   recipients' hedonic preferences. Importantly, hedonic products'
   backfiring effects are attenuated when recipients' preferences are
   perceived as homogeneous or the recipient is familiar to the donor.
   Collectively, these findings emphasize the importance of consumer
   inferences regarding recipients' preferences in determining the efficacy
   of CM promotions that leverage in-kind benefits while elucidating the
   role of product type in the effectiveness of these promotions.},

Title = {Street versus GAAP: Which Effective Tax Rate Is More Informative?},
Journal = {CONTEMPORARY ACCOUNTING RESEARCH},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {38},
Number = {2},
Pages = {1310-1340},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {This study investigates how sophisticated market participants use
   tax-based information by examining whether analysts' street effective
   tax rates (ETRs) are informative. When assessing firm performance,
   analysts exclude items they believe do not reflect current performance,
   resulting in ``street{''} metrics such as street ETR. However, evidence
   on the properties of the components of street earnings is limited.
   Examining the informativeness of street ETRs is important because taxes
   are a significant component of earnings, and the extent to which
   analysts understand taxes and incorporate them into their analyses is
   not clear. Using a hand-collected sample of analyst reports, we find
   that while approximately 35\% of street ETRs have at least one
   tax-specific exclusion, over 90\% reflect the tax effects of pre-tax
   exclusions. Further, both tax-specific exclusions and the tax effects of
   pre-tax exclusions significantly contribute to differences between GAAP
   and street ETRs. Consistent with analysts' understanding of the
   implications of tax and nontax exclusions, our results suggest that
   street tax metrics exhibit greater predictive ability about future tax
   outcomes and provide more information to investors than GAAP tax
   metrics. We also find that ETR exclusions are of higher quality when the
   magnitude of the potentially excluded item is greater and when managers
   disclose pro forma earnings. Collectively, our findings suggest that
   analysts understand taxes, but selectively exert effort to incorporate
   tax-based information into their assessment of firm performance. Our
   study should be informative to regulators and users of financial
   information because it provides evidence regarding the usefulness of
   street earnings metrics.},

Abstract = {International business and management (IB/IM) scholars are increasingly
   calling for more research attention to subject matter that incorporates
   global-scale issues (Buckley, Doh, \& Benischke, 2017). These calls have
   frequently focused on societal ``grand challenges{''} that transcend
   discrete geographical locations and well-defined (typically short) time
   periods. The present long-term energy transition (LTE), characterized by
   a shift away from hydrocarbons and towards renewables, represents an
   important example of a multi-level, multi-actor global challenge that
   unfolds at the interface of business and society, and requires employing
   multiple conceptual lenses to process and understand. Researchers
   addressing such multi-faceted complex problems face a range of
   challenges related to theorizing, framing, modeling, and ultimately
   conducting empirical studies. Based on our collective work as IB
   scholars and journal editors, in this Perspective article we identify
   some of the challenges long-term energy transitions pose, reflect on how
   those challenges can be conceptualized, offer potential responses, and
   propose a future research agenda.},

Abstract = {Recent events, most notably the Global Financial Crisis and the COVID-19
   pandemic, have made it increasingly apparent that liquidity is
   synonymous with corporate survival. In this paper, we explore how
   governments can fulfill an important need as suppliers of liquidity.
   Building on the financing advantage view of state ownership, we theorize
   how state-owned enterprises (SOEs) may provide capital by offering trade
   credit to customer firms. The data indicate a positive relation between
   the level of state ownership and the provision of trade credit. Using an
   institution-focused framework, we further determine that the nation's
   institutional environment systematically affects the opportunities and
   motivations for SOEs to grant trade credit. Specifically, we find that
   SOEs grant more trade credit in countries with less developed financial
   markets, weaker legal protection of creditors, less comprehensive
   information-sharing mechanisms, more collectivist societies, left-wing
   governments, and higher levels of unemployment. Firm-level factors also
   influence the credit-granting decisions of SOEs, with SOEs with lower
   levels of state ownership and higher extents of internationalization
   offering lower amounts of trade credit. Overall, our study offers novel
   insights regarding the important role of state-owned firms as providers
   of liquidity.},

Title = {Back to the future: The effect of returning family successions on firm
   performance},
Journal = {STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT JOURNAL},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {42},
Number = {8},
Pages = {1432-1458},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Research Summary We study successions from a non-family CEO back to a
   family CEO, which we label ``Type-R{''} successions. In our sample of
   489 Italian family firms experiencing the departure of non-family CEOs,
   these successions represent 42\% of all cases. Our
   difference-in-differences results indicate that family firms undertaking
   Type-R successions experience an 18\% superiority in profitability.
   Exploring the heterogeneity underlying this result, we find that Type-R
   successions produce weaker results in contexts that are highly volatile
   and that rely on innovative inputs before succession. Finally, in
   studying the drivers of the performance increase, we find that Type-R
   successions reduce labor costs and spur efficiency. Collectively, our
   evidence suggests that Type-R successions improve performance by
   leveraging family assets while avoiding dysfunctional nepotism and other
   parochial family priorities.
   Managerial Summary How does CEO succession affect family business
   performance? In this article, we study an unexplored yet common
   succession pattern in mature family firms-the appointment of a family
   member following the tenure of an outside CEO. Surprisingly, we find
   that when, after a period of professional leadership, a family CEO
   returns to lead the company; the firm exhibits an 18\% advantage in
   profitability. This result is more prevalent in stable industries, where
   traditional family assets prove especially valuable. A key takeaway of
   our study is that family leadership can enhance performance in companies
   that have already professionalized their governance, and thus have
   learned to reconcile meritocratic principles with family-based assets.},

Journal = {MANAGEMENT SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {67},
Number = {3},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {We develop a model of voluntary disclosure and production decisions and
   use it to establish that firms will tacitly collude by disclosing when
   current market demand is low and when the decision horizon is long. Low
   demand helps sustain tacit collusion, because deviation from tacit
   collusion yields only a limited increase in profit when demand is low.
   Similarly, longer decision horizons give firms incentive to receive the
   benefits of collusion over a longer period. Using monthly production
   forecasts issued by the Big Three U.S. automobile manufacturers, we show
   that the frequency, horizon, and accuracy of the production forecasts
   increase when demand decreases and when the firms focus more on
   long-term profit. Collectively, the evidence suggests that firms use
   voluntary disclosures to tacitly collude.},

Volume = {45},

Abstract = {In this paper, we analyze the choice of interoperability approach for
   the provision of disaster management systems (DMS) when resources are
   distributed across districts, and in times of disaster resources can be
   shared. The degree to which sharing (a spillover) can be coordinated
   efficiently depends on resource interoperability. In this public sector
   setting, we model the provisioning of DMS as the choice between
   interoperability approaches; in decreasing order of centralization they
   are integrated, unified, and federated. A unique feature of our setting
   is that the interoperability approach is a collective decision by
   districts. Districts choose their own DMS resources and interoperability
   effort, and face different interoperability efficiency and technology
   misfit costs depending on the interoperability approach.
   We find that any approach can be an equilibrium depending on
   interoperability efficiency, and that when the social optimum deviates
   from the equilibrium the socially optimal approach is more centralized.
   When subsidies and taxes are implemented, the socially optimal
   interoperability approach can be achieved with budget balance. When only
   subsidies can be used, the socially optimal approach can be achieved but
   only under certain interoperability efficiency and misfit cost
   conditions is there a net social gain. Having an initial level of
   interoperability causes the equilibrium interoperability approach to
   shift toward a less centralized one. Our results generalize to other
   settings characterized by interoperability concerns, collective
   decisions, and spillovers.},

Abstract = {In this study, we examine how team diversity contributes to team
   productivity in nascent ventures depending on family relations.
   Specifically, we explore how bio-demographic diversity influences team
   productivity using data from a panel of 285 nascent venture teams over 5
   years. Results suggest that age and gender diversity have negative
   impacts on team productivity, but that family relationships positively
   moderate these effects. To explain the phenomena, we relied on social
   identity theory and the discussion of the identity confirmation process.
   Through this novel theoretical framework, we describe how identity
   confirmation, through identification with a collective (i.e., family),
   and cross-categorization of family roles mitigate the negative impact of
   bio-demographic diversity. Our findings provide valuable insights to
   scholars interested in bio-demographic team diversity, family
   relationships, and the new venture creation process.},

Abstract = {This paper argues that some of the major theories in current business
   ethics fail to provide an adequate account of moral responsibility for
   the creation of systemic financial risk. Using the trading of credit
   default swaps (CDS) during the 2008 financial crisis as a case study, I
   will formulate three challenges that these theories must address: the
   problem of risk imposition, the problem of unstructured collective harm
   and the problem of limited knowledge. These challenges will be used to
   work out key shortcomings of stakeholder approaches and Integrative
   Social Contracts Theory. I will argue that pluralist connection models
   used in political theory can help to overcome these shortcomings.
   Adopting an approach based on these models shows that financial
   institutions incur obligations in five main areas: managing their own
   risk profile; remedying some of the harms caused by financial crises;
   supporting the development of better epistemic methods; curbing the
   transmission and amplification of initial losses; and instigating
   structural reforms.},

Journal = {ORGANIZATION STUDIES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {43},
Number = {3},
Pages = {369-394},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Emotional energy is key to disruptive institutional work, but we still
   know little about what it is, and importantly, how it is refuelled. This
   empirical paper presents an in-depth case study of `No More Page 3'
   (\#NMP3), an Internet-based feminist organization which fought for the
   removal of sexualized images of women from a UK newspaper. Facing online
   misogyny, actors engage in `emotional energy replenishment' to sustain
   this disruptive institutional work amid emotional highs and lows. We
   introduce `affective embodiment' - the corporeal and emotional
   experiences of the institution - as providing emotional energy in
   relation to disruptive institutional work. Affective embodiment is
   surfaced through alignment or misalignment with others' embodied
   experiences, and this mediates how actors replenish emotional energy.
   Alignment with others' embodied experiences, often connected to online
   abuse, means emotional energy is replenished through `affective
   solidarity' (movement towards the collective). Misalignment, surfaced
   through tensions within the movement, means actors seek replenishment
   through `sensory retreat' (movement away from the collective). This
   study contributes to theorization on institutional work and emotional
   energy by recentring the importance of the body alongside emotions, as
   well as offering important lessons for online organizing.},

Title = {Identities in and around organizations: Towards an identity work
   perspective},
Journal = {HUMAN RELATIONS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {75},
Number = {7},
Pages = {1205-1237},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {There is an emergent identity work perspective that draws on multiple
   intertwined streams of established identities theorizing and
   identities-related research. This perspective is characterized loosely
   by five broad sets of assumptions: (i) selves are reflexive and
   identities actively worked on, both in soliloquy and social interaction;
   (ii) identities are multiple, fluid and rarely fully coherent; (iii)
   identities are constructed within relations of power; (iv) identities
   are not helpfully described as either positive or authentic; and (v)
   identities are both interesting per se and integral to processes of
   organizing. Recognition of an emergent identity work perspective is
   valuable in part because this may act as a counterbalance to centrifugal
   tendencies - fed by myopia, insularity and ethnocentrism - which might
   otherwise lead to blinkered research and fragmentation. The contribution
   of this article is to provide a baseline for identity work scholars, and
   to promote collective critical reflection on identities in and around
   organizations.},

Abstract = {Analyzing qualitative case-study data from two emerging market
   multinational corporations (MNCs) from the Indian pharmaceutical
   industry, we develop two theoretical frameworks based on goal-setting
   and cognitive evaluation theories along with indigenous Indian
   management theories, including the principles of Ayurveda for analyzing
   performance management systems in an indigenous and modern
   pharmaceutical MNC. Data were analyzed from multiple data sources, such
   as interviews, non-participant observation, multiple site visits,
   organizational documents, policies, client testimonials, and publically
   available information through the website and annual reports. The
   indigenous firm offered a holistic approach to managing multiple
   stakeholders. Its overarching performance goal focused on all
   stakeholders collectively contributing to the patient' and others'
   holistic well-being. All employees' and stakeholders' unified and
   singular efforts dovetailed to achieve physical, mental, emotional,
   spiritual, and environmental well-being as a proxy for performance.
   Organizational values, culture, and contextual influences of informal
   learning, empowerment, and task variability helped achieve its
   overarching goals. The Western pharmaceutical firm focused on atomistic,
   granulated, and an objective way of assessing and evaluating
   performance, wherein cost-effectiveness, innovation, and
   high-performance were vital performance outcomes. Performance coaching
   and task invariability adversely affected individual outcomes.
   Implications for research and practice are discussed.},

Pages = {289-308},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Consumer research has focused on the various resources and tactics that
   help movements achieve a range of institutional and marketplace changes.
   Yet, little attention has been paid to the persistence of movement
   solidarity, in particular its regeneration, despite a range of threats
   to it. Our research unpacks mechanisms that help consumer movement
   solidarity to overcome threats. Drawing on a 6-year ethnographic study
   of consumer movements in Exarcheia, a neighborhood in central Athens,
   Greece, we find that consumer movement solidarity persists despite a
   cataclysmic economic crisis that undermines their prevalent ideology and
   the emotional fatigue, that is, common in such movements. Three key
   mechanisms serve to overcome these threats: performative staging of
   collectivism, temporal tactics, and the emplacement of counter-sites.
   Overall, our study contributes to consumer research by illuminating how
   threats to solidarity are overcome by specific internal mechanisms that
   enable the regeneration of consumer movement solidarity.},

Abstract = {Conceptualized as a meta-construct, operations-related structural flux
   (ORSF) refers to appointments and exits-voluntary or involuntary-of
   operations-related executives, to and from the firm. This research
   leverages the contingency theory perspective to show that ORSF's
   influence on firm performance is contingent on contextual circumstances
   of such executive changes, specifically, appointments and
   exits-voluntary or involuntary. Examining executive turnover data from
   North American public firms between 2000 and 2016, the authors find that
   the firm-level context of operations executives' turnover is
   consequential for firm performance. On average, operations appointments
   are adaptive, but operations exits, including those due to both
   voluntary and involuntary reasons, disrupt firm performance. However,
   parallel effects are not evident for marketing- and finance-related
   appointments and exits. Furthermore, our study reveals that exit of one
   operations executive hurts firm performance (measured in terms of
   Tobin's q) by 3.3\%. A post-hoc analysis finds that firm performance of
   the sample firms that witness involuntary operations-related exits
   (IVOpE)is, on average, 9.2\% lower than that of the sample firms that do
   not witness IVOpE. These results indicate the outsized influence of
   operations-related executives, who collectively are generally
   responsible for much of a firm's budget, workforce, resources,
   structures, and capabilities.},

Abstract = {Movements seeking to infuse markets with moral values often end up
   utilizing the market mechanism and support from mainstream actors to
   scale up, even if it comes at the cost of diluting their founding ethos.
   But this process can be particularly challenging for movements that are
   explicitly opposed to using a market mechanism as a means of scaling up.
   Our analysis of yoga between 1975 and 2016 reveals how a countercultural
   movement fundamentally opposed to a capitalist market economy but
   seeking to grow can paradoxically become syncretic with or infiltrated
   by concepts and beliefs that are core to the market system but
   incompatible with the movement's original ethos. We show how, before
   such a movement can be commodified, it must be de-essentialized, a
   process that requires stripping away key aspects of its history,
   context, and religious commitments and transforming collective goals
   into individual ones. This process involves not only external
   entrepreneurs looking to mine the movement but also movement leaders
   seeking wider enrollment of resource-rich actors to scale the movement
   up. We show how codes borrowed from parallel movements and templates
   borrowed from markets can be instrumental in driving such a movement's
   transformation. Through this extreme case of the yoga movement, we
   advance understandings of how movements can become syncretic with values
   and practices they fundamentally oppose.},

Abstract = {High levels of economic inequality are widely viewed as a key challenge
   facing both advanced industrial and developing economies. Country-level
   studies have consistently shown a negative link between income
   inequality and trust in others. This is typically attributed to greater
   social distance within unequal societies. Do we observe similar
   relationships within organisations? This is an important question
   because employee trust is associated with important outcomes for workers
   and organisations. We answer it by investigating the relationship
   between pay inequality and employee trust in managers at the workplace
   level using large-scale nationally representative matched
   employer-employee data from Britain. The article uses innovative machine
   learning methods to demonstrate a curvilinear relationship between pay
   inequality and trust. When pay inequality is at low to moderate levels,
   increasing inequality is associated with increasing employee trust but
   when pay inequality passes a certain threshold the relationship turns
   negative. The relationship is mediated by employees' perceptions of
   manager fairness and moderated by employee collective voice. The
   implications of these findings for theory, research methodology,
   practice and future studies are discussed.},

Abstract = {\#MeToo has inspired the voices of millions of people (mostly women) to
   speak up about sexual harassment at work. The high-profile cases that
   reignited this movement have revealed that sexual harassment is and has
   been shrouded in silence, sometimes for decades. In the face of sexual
   harassment, managers, witnesses and targets often remain silent,
   wittingly or unwittingly protecting perpetrators and allowing harassment
   to persist. In this integrated conceptual review, we introduce the
   concept of network silence around sexual harassment, and theorize that
   social network compositions and belief systems can promote network
   silence. Specifically, network composition (harasser and male
   centrality) and belief systems (harassment myths and valorizing
   masculinity) combine to instill network silence around sexual
   harassment. Moreover, such belief systems elevate harassers and men to
   central positions within networks, who in turn may promote problematic
   belief systems, creating a mutually reinforcing dynamic. We theorize
   that network silence contributes to the persistence of sexual harassment
   due to the lack of consequences for perpetrators and support for
   victims, which further reinforces silence. Collectively, this process
   generates a culture of sexual harassment. We identify ways that
   organizations can employ an understanding of social networks to
   intervene in the social forces that give rise to silence surrounding
   sexual harassment.},

Title = {A Framework for Analyzing Influencer Marketing in Social Networks:
   Selection and Scheduling of Influencers},
Journal = {MANAGEMENT SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {68},
Number = {1},
Pages = {75-104},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Explosive growth in the number of users on various social media
   platforms has transformed the way firms strategize their marketing
   activities. To take advantage of the vast size of social networks, firms
   have now turned their attention to influencer marketing wherein they
   employ independent influencers to promote their products on social media
   platforms. Despite the recent growth in influencer marketing, the
   problem of network seeding (i.e., identification of influencers to
   optimally post a firm's message or advertisement) neither has been
   rigorously studied in the academic literature nor has been carefully
   addressed in practice. We develop a data-driven optimization framework
   to help a firm successfully conduct (i) short-horizon and (ii)
   long-horizon influencer marketing campaigns, for which two models are
   developed, respectively, to maximize the firm's benefit. The models are
   based on the interactions with marketers, observation of firms' message
   placements on social media, and model parameters estimated via empirical
   analysis performed on data from Twitter. Our empirical analysis
   discovers the effects of collective influence of multiple influencers
   and finds two important parameters to be included in the models, namely,
   multiple exposure effect and forgetting effect. For the short-horizon
   campaign, we develop an optimization model to select influencers and
   present structural properties for the model. Using these properties, we
   develop a mathematical programming based polynomial time procedure to
   provide near-optimal solutions. For the long-horizon problem, we develop
   an efficient solution procedure to simultaneously select influencers and
   schedule their message postings over a planning horizon. We demonstrate
   the superiority of our solution strategies for both short-and long
   horizon problems against multiple benchmark methods used in practice.
   Finally, we present several managerially relevant insights for firms in
   the influencer marketing context.},

Abstract = {The idea of economic peace is a ``counterpoint{''} to a warlike view of
   the economy. Viewing things in terms of economic peace makes it possible
   to develop a different economic anthropology. The idea of economic peace
   is used to think about a fundamental revision of the relationships to
   self and between actors. It sits at the intersection of peace studies(,)
   social and cognitive psychology, institutional conventionalist
   approaches, postmodernist philosophy and sinology. By employing the
   inchoate concept of economic peace, this article explores the
   opportunity to extend and deepen the relationship between individual and
   collective responsibility. The article describes individual and
   collective practices or avenues which could be useful when reacting to
   complex situations.},

   Risk{*}},
Journal = {CONTEMPORARY ACCOUNTING RESEARCH},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {38},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Prior research documents that information transmitted via director
   networks affects firms' policies and real economic activities. Given a
   manager's potential monopoly over firm information, it is important to
   analyze whether information transmission through director social
   networks undermines the manager's control. Specifically, we explore
   whether information flow through director networks influences managers'
   ability to hoard bad news. We predict and find that the extent of
   external connections of the board of directors is negatively associated
   with future stock price crash risk. Additional analysis implies that
   this evidence is driven by firms with more powerful executives, with
   weaker auditor monitoring, or subject to strong investor protection, and
   by directors with greater monitoring incentives or responsibilities and
   directors with less firm-specific knowledge. Collectively, our research
   lends empirical support for the monitoring view under which
   better-informed directors narrow the scope for bad news hoarding evident
   in stock price crash risk. In another series of tests, we fail to find
   evidence consistent with the information leakage view under which
   directors pass sensitive firm-specific information to connections that
   trade on the information before its public release. Other analysis helps
   dispel the concern that the endogenous match between directors and
   companies is spuriously responsible for our core results. Our empirical
   findings have important implications on how social networks affect the
   proper functioning of capital markets.},

Volume = {64},

Abstract = {We advance resource dependence theory (RDT) by answering calls for
   theorizing on both how being dependent on external entities for
   resources affects firms and the heterogeneous nature of such
   dependencies. Specifically, we theorize how internal firm dynamics and
   performance are affected by resource dependence by integrating resource
   orchestration (RO) into RDT. Building on RO, we argue that as the degree
   to which a firm is dependent upon a single source of revenue increases
   (a core tenet of RDT), the firm adjusts internally by reducing
   investments and the market responds negatively as well. Further, we
   argue that the heterogeneous nature of such dependence-namely,
   dependence scope (the spread of dependence throughout the entity with
   which the dependence relationship resides), dependence supplementation
   (the addition of new relationships within the prior dependence
   relationship), and dependence stability (the expected length of the
   dependence relationship)-moderates the relationship between the level of
   dependence and these outcomes. We find broad support for our theorizing
   in a longitudinal sample of manufacturing firms' dependence upon
   governmental contracts for revenue. Collectively, we advance
   understanding of RDT by adding nuance to both explanatory mechanisms
   underlying dependence and conceptualizations of firms' external
   dependence relationships, posing theoretical and practical implications.},

Abstract = {Communication facilitates cooperation by ensuring that deviators are

   to threaten one another, and we identify ways that organizations can

   trust games with a sequence of short-run agents who communicate with
   each other. An agent can shirk and then extort pay by threatening to
   report that the principal deviated. We show that these threats can
   completely undermine cooperation. Investigations of agents' efforts, or
   dyadic relationships between the principal and each agent, can deter
   extortion and restore some cooperation. Investigations of the
   principal's action, on the other hand, typically do not help. Our
   analysis suggests that collective punishments are vulnerable to misuse

Abstract = {Using administrative payroll data from the largest US payroll processing
   company, we measure the extent of nominal wage rigidity in the United
   States. The data allow us to define a worker's per-period base contract
   wage separately from other forms of compensation such as overtime
   premiums and bonuses. We provide evidence that firms use base wages to
   cyclically adjust the marginal cost of their workers. Nominal base wage
   declines are much rarer than previously thought with only 2 percent of
   job-stayers receiving a nominal base wage cut during a given year.
   Approximately 35 percent of workers receive no base wage change year
   over year. We document strong evidence of both time and state dependence
   in nominal base wage adjustments. In addition, we provide evidence that
   the flexibility of new hire base wages is similar to that of existing
   workers. Collectively, our results can be used to discipline models of
   nominal wage rigidity.},

Abstract = {With the outbreak of COVID-19, there have been growing reports of racial
   harassment targeting Asian Americans. We study one such manifestation of
   racial harassment that Asian employees may face in the workplace:
   Leaders' use of stigmatizing labels for COVID-19 such as the ``Chinese
   Virus{''} and ``Kung Flu.{''} Integrating organizational justice
   theories with research on racial harassment in the workplace, we
   theorize that leaders' use of stigmatizing COVID-19 labels reduces
   employees' perceptions of interpersonal justice, which subsequently
   impact employees' emotional exhaustion and work engagement. We further
   theorize that while such effects will be stronger among Asian employees
   who experience both moral anger and reduced public collective
   self-esteem, that the effects will also be present among non-Asian
   employees who experience moral anger. Using one survey (Study 1) and one
   experiment (Study 2), we find support for our predictions. We find that
   leaders' use of stigmatizing language to depict COVID-19 leads to
   deleterious workplace experiences for employees, and especially for
   Asian employees. The current research thus deepens our understanding of
   the relatively understudied work experiences of Asian Americans and
   brings to light the underlying psychological mechanisms linking racial
   harassment and employee work outcomes for both targeted employees and
   employees not targeted.},

Volume = {47},

Abstract = {Drawing on institutional theory and discursive psychology, this article
   elucidates how actors use emotion discourse to undermine the legitimacy
   of consumer practices. Based on an empirical investigation of the
   bullfighting controversy in Spain, our work shows how activists engage
   in the production and circulation of compelling emotional prototypes of
   their adversaries. Such emotional prototypes constitute the discursive
   foundations of a pathic stigma, which, once established, taints the
   identity of the social groups associated with the practice. Our work
   frames the centrality of pathic stigmatization as a cultural mechanism
   mediating the relationship between emotion discourse and the subsequent
   delegitimization of consumer practices. We make three key contributions
   to the literature: we advance a rhetorical perspective on emotions and
   their role in deinstitutionalization processes; we further develop the
   theory of marketplace sentiments by showing how sentiments operate
   downstream; and we provide evidence of the sociocultural mechanisms
   underpinning the emotional vilification, stereotyping and stigmatization
   of consumer collectives.},

Abstract = {The paper focuses on affective resistance with an emphasis on the
   context in which resistant action emerges, and on the liberating power
   of laughter. It adopts the approach of `affective ethnographic history'
   to examine the activities of the Polish oppositional artistic
   collective, the Orange Alternative (OA), between 1986 and 1989. The OA
   organized interventions in the streets of Polish cities which engaged
   the general public as participants. The focus of the interventions was
   on the creation of affective atmospheres leading to affective
   transitions in the participants from fear to the lack of fear. The paper
   contributes to scholarly debates on resistance in three ways: (1) it
   proposes that resistance and its efficacy should be assessed not in
   terms of the form of resistance, but through consideration of resistant
   action in relation to the context of its emergence; (2) it demonstrates
   how affective resistance operates through affective atmospheres that
   result in affective transitions to the state of lack of fear; and (3) it
   reconsiders the significance of laughter as an affective force that has
   liberating consequences both within a particular resistance assemblage
   and beyond it.},

   legitimacy. We identify three key legitimation processes-discursive

Abstract = {It is widely acknowledged that subgroup bias can influence hiring
   evaluations. However, the notion that bias still threatens equitable
   hiring outcomes in modern employment contexts continues to be debated,
   even among organizational scholars. In this study, we sought to
   contextualize this debate by estimating the practical impact of bias on
   real-world hiring outcomes (a) across a wide range of hiring scenarios
   and (b) in the presence of diversity-oriented staffing practices. Toward
   this end, we conducted a targeted meta-analysis of recent hiring
   experiments that manipulated both candidate gender and qualifications to
   couch our investigation within ongoing debates surrounding the impact of
   small amounts of bias in otherwise meritocratic hiring contexts.
   Consistent with prior research, we found evidence of small gender bias
   effects (d = -0.30) and large qualification effects (d = 1.61) on hiring
   managers' evaluations of candidate hireability. We then used these
   values to inform the starting parameters of a large-scale computer
   simulation designed to model conventional processes by which candidates
   are recruited, evaluated, and selected for open positions. Collectively,
   our simulation findings empirically substantiate assertions that even
   seemingly trivial amounts of subgroup bias can produce practically
   significant rates of hiring discrimination and productivity loss.
   Furthermore, we found contextual factors can alter but cannot obviate
   the consequences of biased evaluations, even within apparently optimal
   hiring scenarios (e.g., when extremely valid assessments are used).
   Finally, our results demonstrate residual amounts of subgroup bias can
   undermine the effectiveness of otherwise successful targeted recruitment
   efforts. Implications for future research and practice are discussed.},

Journal = {ORGANIZATION STUDIES},

Volume = {42},
Number = {2, SI},
Pages = {301-326},

Abstract = {This study theorizes on the sociomateriality of food in
   authority-building processes of partial organizations by exploring
   alternative food networks (AFNs). Through the construction of arenas for
   food provisioning, AFNs represent grassroots collectives that
   deliberately differentiate their practices from mainstream forms of food
   provisioning. Based on a sequential mixed-methods analysis of 24 AFNs,
   where an inductive chronological analysis is followed by a qualitative
   comparative analysis (QCA), we found that the entanglements between
   participants' food provisioning practices and food itself shape how
   authority emerges in AFNs. Food generates biological, physiological and
   social struggles for AFN participants who, in turn, respond by embracing
   or avoiding them. As an outcome, most AFNs tend to bureaucratize over
   time according to four identified patterns while a few idiosyncratically
   build a more shared basis of authority. We conclude that the
   sociomateriality of food plays an important yet indirect role in
   understanding why and how food provisioning arenas re-organize and forge
   their forms of authority over time.},

Abstract = {How can individual scientists most effectively spread the adoption of
   open science practices? Engaging in open science practices presents a
   social dilemma because they are individually costly (given the current
   incentive schemes in academia) but collectively beneficial (due to
   production of higher quality and more accessible science). Mechanisms
   for promoting cooperation in social dilemmas typically rely on
   normativity-but open science practices are still comparatively rare.
   Further, individuals may be tempted to dishonestly ``virtue signal{''}
   due to growing support for open science. We formulate a solution based
   on the theory of credibility-enhancing displays: advocates who are known
   to themselves practice the behavior they are advocating for
   (particularly if they are prestigious) are more effective at convincing
   others-specifically because their actions provide an honest signal of
   their belief in the behavior's value. Thus, advocates for open science
   practices should find ways to engage in those practices visibly and
   often.},

Abstract = {Auditors increasingly employ technologies to improve audit quality.
   Using a design science approach, we examine whether using drones and
   automated counting software can improve audit quality and thus financial
   reporting. We assess three dimensions of audit quality-efficiency,
   effectiveness, and quality of documentation. We show that auditors can
   perform inventory counts with these technologies much more efficiently
   than they can with manual techniques, decreasing count time in our study
   from 681 h to 19 h. Similarly, auditors can maintain or improve audit
   effectiveness, decreasing error rates in our study from 0.15\% to 0.03\%
   while providing higher-quality audit documentation. Interviews with
   national-level partners and audit standard setters highlight impediments
   to adopting these technologies, including firm concerns about being
   first movers combined with inability of standard setters to provide
   guidance at a pace that matches the pace of technological development.
   Collectively, our results suggest that technology-enabled inventory
   audits can improve audit quality and further regulatory guidance on
   using such technologies would enhance adoption.},

Abstract = {Over the past two decades, a growing body of research on human resource
   management (HRM) has analyzed the relationship between international HRM
   and institutions. This work has primarily been informed by two leading
   streams of theory-organizational institutionalism and comparative
   institutionalism. However, these two dominant streams have seen much
   juxtaposition, but little logical integration. Moreover, scholars have
   paid little attention to the dynamics of contextualization (more
   specifically, institutional development and evolution), which limits the
   relevance of extant research. In this article, we review the extant
   literatures and their intellectual origins and develop an integrative
   research agenda that emphasizes the multilevel nature of HRM and
   evolution under external institutional change.},

Abstract = {Social movements, such as Black Lives Matter, surge when support grows
   for their social justice goals. At their core, social movements advance
   when people act collectively by rising in solidarity with a shared
   purpose to address injustice and inequality. Drawing on insights from
   consumer psychology, this review investigates how social movements
   succeed in creating social change. We build on an established
   21(st)-century framework for how social movements succeed to outline the
   promising practices of successful social movements. For each of these
   practices, we identify the consumer psychology mechanisms that motivate
   collective action and encourage people to transform from bystanders to
   upstanders, those who provide the grassroots momentum for successful
   social movements. We illustrate this framework with examples from the
   growth of the Black Lives Matter movement. Finally, we highlight
   insights from consumer psychology that promote an understanding of
   social movements, and we raise research questions to encourage more
   consumer psychologists to investigate how social movements succeed.},

Abstract = {The literature shows that earnings have come to explain less stock price
   movement over time, suggesting that firm fundamental information has
   become less important. In this paper, we replace earnings with earnings
   announcement returns as a measure of firm fundamental news and find that
   these firm fundamentals have come to explain more price movement over
   time. In the years after 2003, earnings announcement returns explain
   roughly 20\% of the annual return-almost twice as much as they did
   before, indicating that fundamental information has become more
   important, not less, in explaining stock returns. This pattern occurs
   for other forms of firm fundamental information. Collectively, the
   returns around earnings announcements, management guidance, analyst
   forecasts, analyst recommendations, and 8-K filings went from explaining
   17\% of annual returns on average in the late 1990s to 39\% on average
   in the early 2010s. In exploring possible explanations for the increase
   in the explanatory power of fundamental information, we find evidence
   consistent with regulatory changes, such as new 8-K filing requirements
   and Sarbanes-Oxley, collectively making disclosures more informative.},

Abstract = {Advances in Information and Communication Technology (ICT) and the
   distributed nature of innovation in a culturally heterogeneous world
   raise an important question about how ICT and culture jointly influence
   innovation. We argue that ICT shapes the influence of culture dimensions
   on national innovation in nuanced ways, depending on the nature of the
   dimensions. In particular, cultural dimensions that pertain to norms,
   formality, and structure (e.g., power distance and uncertainty
   avoidance) are often considered detrimental to innovation, whereas
   culture dimensions that pertain to the pursuit of goals and achievement
   (e.g., individualism, masculinity, and long-term orientation) are often
   considered conducive for innovation. We hypothesize that ICT amplifies
   the positive effects of individualism, masculinity, and long-term
   orientation on national innovation-and, attenuates the negative effects
   of power distance and uncertainty avoidance on national innovation. Our
   analyses of data on 66 countries from 2007 to 2015 broadly support our
   hypotheses about ICT amplifying the positive effects of individualism
   and long-term orientation, as well as our hypotheses about ICT
   attenuating the negative effects of power distance and uncertainty
   avoidance on national innovation. The findings suggest that ICT
   amplifies the effects of culture dimensions related to the pursuit of
   goals and helps overcome barriers to innovation that arise from a
   culture's focus on norms, formality, and structure. In turn, these
   findings can help managers and policy makers to make judicious decisions
   regarding ICT investments to transcend or leverage the country's
   cultural characteristics for innovation.},

Abstract = {This paper examines how board gender diversity affects corporate risk
   disclosure. We exploit an exogenous shock on firms' risk environment
   created by the United Kingdom's vote to leave the European Union
   (Brexit) and analyze related risk disclosure in annual reports of public
   firms in the UK. Using this unique setting, we mitigate concerns about
   omitted variables in concurrent studies. The findings suggest that board
   gender diversity is positively related to corporate risk disclosure.
   However, our results also indicate that the proportion of female
   directors needs to reach a critical mass to impact the risk disclosure
   decision. Moreover, we find lower bid-ask spreads immediately after the
   referendum date for those firms that disclosed Brexit-related risks in
   their annual reports prior to the vote. Collectively, our results are
   consistent with board gender diversity promoting the disclosure of
   decision-relevant information through improved board group dynamics.},

   Interlocks},

Abstract = {We use a social learning perspective to extend our understanding of
   information technology (IT) investment and return. Specifically, we
   investigate social learning in the context of interlocks between
   corporate boards, which allow firms to share knowledge and experiences
   with respect to their IT investments. Using a large data set of
   firm-years from 2001-2008, we find (a) a positive relationship exists
   between a focal firm's IT investment and that of its interlocked firms;
   (b) this positive relationship is amplified by the interlocked firms' IT
   capability but only if the focal firm has an active board, which devotes
   time to allow sufficient communication among directors; and (c) the
   component of the focal firm's IT investment that is attributable to
   board interlock influence is positively related to the firm's
   performance but only if the firm has an active board. Collectively,
   these findings support our central thesis: social learning through board
   interlocks can play a significant role in influencing a firm's IT
   investments and enhancing their payoff. That said, attaining such
   benefits requires boards to incorporate those firms with high IT
   management capability and to strengthen board activity so interlocked
   members can substantively share their knowledge and experiences with IT
   investments.},

Title = {Making Space for Emotions: Empathy, Contagion, and Legitimacy's
   Double-Edged Sword},
Journal = {ORGANIZATION SCIENCE},

Volume = {32},

Abstract = {Legitimacy is critical to the formation and expansion of nascent fields
   because it lends credibility and recognizability to once overlooked
   actors and practices. At the same time, legitimacy can be a double-edged
   sword precisely because it facilitates field growth, attracting actors
   with discrepant practices that may lead to factionalization and
   undermine the coherence of the field's collective identity. In this
   paper, we investigate how organizations can mitigate the downside of
   legitimation by eliciting emotions that align increasingly discrepant
   actors and celebrate an inclusive collective identity. We leverage
   fieldwork and computational text analysis to examine the relationship
   between legitimation, collective identity coherence, and emotions in the
   context of the Makers, a nascent field of do-it-yourself hobbyists and
   technology hackers. In our quantitative analysis we show that
   legitimation was associated with increased field heterogeneity, but that
   collective events countered the diluting effects of legitimation. In the
   qualitative analysis of our interview data we demonstrate that
   activities at these events-demonstrations and hands-on
   experiences-elicited emotional contagion and empathy among actors. These
   emotions reconciled tensions among increasingly heterogeneous actors and
   bolstered the coherence of the Maker collective identity. We conclude by
   discussing our contribution to research on legitimacy, collective
   identity, and field-configuring events.},

Title = {Does an Asset Owner's Institutional Setting Influence Its Decision to
   Sign the Principles for Responsible Investment?},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ETHICS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {168},
Number = {2, SI},
Pages = {389-414},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {From a simple idea to unite asset owners in their quest for responsible
   investment (RI) at its launch in April 2006, the United Nations
   supported Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI) have grown in just
   one decade into an initiative with more than 1500 fee-paying
   signatories. Jointly, the PRI's signatories hold assets worth more than
   \$80 trillion, making it one of the more prevalent not-for-profit
   organizations worldwide. Furthermore, the PRI's ambitious mission to
   transform the financial system at large into a more sustainable one
   makes it a worthwhile subject of inquiry from an institutional
   perspective. We undertake an empirical investigation of the adoption of
   the PRI by asset owners during five crucial years of the association's
   emergence: 2007-2011. Following a tripartite view of institutional
   theory proposed by Scott (Institutions and organizations. Foundations
   for organizational science, A Sage Publication Series, London, 1995), we
   explore if regulative, normative, and cultural-cognitive factors
   influence an asset owner's decision to subscribe to the PRI. Applying
   both parametric and non-parametric survival analysis, we find that asset
   owners are indeed significantly affected by normative,
   cultural-cognitive, and regulative aspects. In particular, (i) public
   service employee and labor union pension funds (ii) from social
   backgrounds more culturally aligned with values represented by the RI
   movement (iii) with historically more voluntary legislation on
   environmental, social, and governance (ESG) issues are most likely to
   sign the PRI. In contrast, institutional environments with a higher
   number of pre-existing mandatory ESG regulation decrease the likelihood
   of signing the PRI. Our results indicate that normative and
   cultural-cognitive factors were crucial contributors to the PRI's
   growth. With respect to the regulative environments, our results imply
   that some asset owners may use the PRI as a collective industry
   initiative to substitute for mandatory legislation. Conversely, a high
   level of historical mandatory legislation may constrain organizational
   resources that could otherwise be dedicated to voluntary initiatives
   such as PRI. Our findings are robust to relevant controls and
   econometric concerns.},

Title = {Moving Violations: Pairing an Illegitimate Learning Hierarchy with
   Trainee Status Mobility for Acquiring New Skills When Traditional
   Expertise Erodes},
Journal = {ORGANIZATION SCIENCE},

Volume = {32},
Number = {1},

Month = {JAN-FEB},
Abstract = {We explore how members of a community of practice learn new tools and
   techniques when environmental shifts undermine existing expertise. In
   our 20-month comparative field study of medical assistants and
   patient-service representatives learning to use new digital technology
   in five primary care sites, we find that the traditional
   master-apprentice training model worked well when established practices
   were being conferred to trainees. When environmental change required
   introducing new tools and techniques with which the experienced members
   had no expertise, third-party managers selected newer members as
   trainers because managers judged them to be agile learners who were less
   committed to traditional hierarchies and more willing to deviate from
   traditional norms. This challenged community members' existing status,
   which was based on the historical distinctions of long tenure and
   expertise in traditional tasks. In three sites, the introduction of this
   illegitimate learning hierarchy sparked status competition among
   trainees and trainers, and trainees collectively resisted learning new
   tools and techniques. In the other two sites, managers paired the new,
   illegitimate learning hierarchy with the opportunity for trainee status
   mobility by rotating the trainer role; here, trainees embraced learning
   in order to exit the lower-status trainee group and join the
   higher-status trainer group. Drawing on ideas of status group legitimacy
   and mobility, we suggest that managers' pairing of an illegitimate
   learning hierarchy with the opportunity for trainee status mobility is a
   mechanism for enabling the situated learning of new techniques when
   traditional expertise erodes.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ETHICS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {176},
Number = {1},
Pages = {127-139},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Prior research has demonstrated a strong relationship between team
   performance and team members' team efficacy beliefs and perceptions of
   social integration. Performing well increases the feelings of collective
   ability that comprise team efficacy and the feelings of psychological
   connectedness that make up social integration, while performing poorly
   erodes them. In this article, we draw from the social cognitive base of
   ethical leadership theory to argue that ethical leadership moderates the
   relationship between team performance and team efficacy beliefs, and
   between team performance and social integration, such that these
   important team attitudes are buffered against the negative effects of
   poor performance when leaders act ethically. Alternatively, when leaders
   act less ethically, team efficacy and social integration break down
   following poor performance. We test our hypotheses in a field study of
   U.S. military teams actively engaged in competition. The data support
   our arguments. We find that ethical leadership weakens the relationships
   among team performance and team efficacy and social integration,
   respectively, such that ethical leaders preserve team efficacy and
   social integration when their teams do not perform well.},

Volume = {32},
Number = {1},
Pages = {233-255},
Month = {JAN-FEB},
Abstract = {We analyze the relationship between the actions and interactions of
   secondary stakeholders with an interest in corporate social performance
   (CSP) and variation in firm-level CSP across countries. Our work
   represents a significant theoretical shift in research exploring
   comparative CSP, which, to date, has focused on cross-national variation
   in institutions. We propose that stakeholders can also drive
   cross-country heterogeneity in CSP by influencing the salience of the
   issues for which they advocate. Stakeholders raise salience of CSP
   issues through their interactions with important sociopolitical actors
   within a country, signaling their collective ability to change
   expectations on CSP. CSP issue salience is also heightened where
   heterogeneous stakeholder groups advocate for CSP issues, signaling that
   issues have garnered widespread acceptance or legitimacy. Managers are
   also more attuned to the urgency of issues through the direct actions
   that stakeholders take against firms in the country. We also argue and
   find that these effects are moderated by interstakeholder interactions,
   which signal the degree of consensus among stakeholders on issues and
   their ability to mobilize repeatedly against firms. Wedraw on a novel
   data set of 250 million media-reported events to identify secondary
   stakeholders with interests in the environmental and social issues that
   constitute CSP, their direct actions against firms, and their
   interactions with important sociopolitical actors and each other. We
   show empirically that variation in secondary stakeholder actions and
   interactions between countries, and within countries over time, is
   associated with differences in firm-level CSP among a sample of 2,852
   firms spanning 36 countries from 2004 to 2013.},

Abstract = {Focal firms are struggling to improve their environmental performance
   for several reasons, including a scarcity of internal and external
   environmental resources. This study suggests that coopetition provides a
   boost to a focal firm's environmental performance. In particular, this
   research theorizes that a coopetitor firm's environmental performance
   has a spillover effect on a focal firm's environmental performance. This
   study also investigates the moderating role of a focal firm's financial
   slack, financial leverage, and inventory leanness on this relationship.
   The empirical analysis indicates that coopetitor firms' environmental
   performance significantly influences a focal firm's environmental
   performance. This relationship is weaker for firms with higher financial
   slack, and stronger for firms that have lower financial leverage and
   higher leanness. Collectively, these findings provide important
   managerial and research implications regarding the consequences of
   coopetition on a focal firm's environmental performance.},

Title = {A meta-analysis of agglomeration and venture performance: Firm-level

Abstract = {Research summary Agglomeration theory has long explored and asserted
   that similar firms locate in close geographic proximity for
   performance-related benefits. However, no study has systematically
   assessed the literature to determine whether the relationship between
   agglomeration and firm performance holds. Through a meta-analysis of 42
   studies and nearly 200,000 firm-level observations, our study estimates
   the relationship between agglomeration and performance, showing the
   importance of knowledge spillovers in this relationship. Specifically,
   we find although agglomeration confers innovation benefits, it does not
   consistently offer financial performance benefits. We also highlight
   several important conditions, including firm age, industry technology
   intensity, and economic development level that impact the
   agglomeration-performance relationship. Together, our work advances
   agglomeration theory by suggesting when, and to what extent,
   agglomeration holds the most promise for organizations.
   Managerial summary All firms must address a fundamental question before
   launching their firms-where to locate? Existing thought largely suggests
   that locating near similar firms offers certain advantages, such as
   reducing search costs for skilled employees or gaining access to
   knowledge spillovers. By examining the body of literature on this topic,
   our study analyzes the collective evidence of the performance benefits
   of co-location. We find that co-location generally enhances firm
   innovation, but we discover it fails to increase firm financial
   performance, on average. And, in some cases, co-location is detrimental
   to financial performance. Ultimately, we offer a variety of
   contingencies that help explain when co-locating might be advantageous
   or disadvantageous to firms, thereby providing firm leaders and
   entrepreneurs with clear guidance on when (and when not) to co-locate.},

Title = {Do Auditors Accurately Predict Litigation and Reputation Consequences of
   Inaccurate Accounting Estimates?},
Journal = {CONTEMPORARY ACCOUNTING RESEARCH},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {38},
Number = {1},
Pages = {276-301},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {To effectively manage audit risk, auditors must correctly predict the
   potential litigation and reputation consequences associated with
   inaccurate accounting estimates. Accurate predictions are critical
   because underestimation of negative consequences leads to excess legal
   exposure and overestimation leads to overauditing. Our paper examines
   whether auditors correctly anticipate these litigation and reputation
   outcomes. We provide manager- and partner-level auditors with case facts
   from an auditor negligence lawsuit and ask them to predict the
   proportion of juries that will return verdicts against their firm. We
   then compare auditors' predictions to the actual verdicts we observe
   when we provide the same set of case facts to mock jurors who deliberate
   as part of juries. We find that auditors overestimate the likelihood of
   negligence verdicts, especially when audit quality is relatively high.
   Our supplemental measures help explain the reasons for this
   overestimation: auditors tend to underestimate jurors' perceptions of
   audit quality and willingness to attribute inaccurate estimates to
   situational factors. Finally, we examine auditors' predictions about how
   a news article about the litigation will affect their reputation with
   the general public. Similar to our litigation results, we find that
   auditors tend to overestimate the article's negative impact on auditor
   reputation. Collectively, our findings suggest that auditors
   overestimate litigation and reputation consequences resulting from
   inaccurate accounting estimates. This overestimation is consequential as
   it leads to inefficient allocation of audit resources.},

Volume = {47},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Despite assumptions that counterproductive work behavior (CWB) leads to
   detrimental outcomes for organizations, most of the existing CWB
   research focuses on outcomes for the individual employee. In the present
   study, we clarify fundamental issues regarding unit-level CWB, including
   its definition and how it is distinct from individual-level CWB. We then
   use social information-processing (SIP) theory as a lens to articulate
   our hypotheses regarding the factors associated with unit-level CWB's
   emergence (e.g., collective attitudes, human resources practices,
   leadership) as well as its relationship with unit-level performance
   (e.g., profit, customer satisfaction). We use meta-analysis
   (representing 7,110 units and over 391,000 employees) to test our
   hypotheses. Our results show that unit-level CWB is significantly
   related to antecedents such as collective job attitudes, the use of
   strategic human resource management practices (e.g., staffing, training,
   rewards), and collective perceptions of the work environment (e.g.,
   unit-level fairness perceptions). Moreover, we demonstrate that
   unit-level CWB is empirically linked to unit-level productivity (rho =
   -.23), turnover (rho = .22), customer satisfaction (rho = -.26), and
   profit (rho = -.31), which verifies the detrimental consequences of CWB
   at the strategic level. We conclude with a detailed discussion of the
   theoretical and practical implications of this study as well as a clear
   plan for future research.},

Journal = {CONTEMPORARY ACCOUNTING RESEARCH},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {38},
Number = {2},
Pages = {1434-1464},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {We examine the causal effects of corporate governance on earnings
   management using shareholder-sponsored proposals that pass or fail by a
   small margin of votes in annual shareholder meetings. This setting
   provides a causal estimate that overcomes concerns of endogeneity.
   Specifically, compared with firms whose shareholder proposals fall just
   short of a majority threshold, firms whose shareholder proposals
   narrowly pass have similar characteristics but a discretely higher
   likelihood of implementing improvements in governance. As such, we
   expect that firms whose shareholder proposals pass the threshold by a
   small margin exhibit a significantly lower level of earnings management.
   Employing a regression discontinuity design, we find results that
   support our expectation based on the propensity to just meet or beat
   analysts' forecasts by one cent as a proxy for earnings management. In
   addition, we show that the results are driven by governance changes that
   increase directors' monitoring. Our results are robust to using
   discretionary accruals as an alternative measure of earnings management.
   Collectively, the results suggest that improvements in corporate
   governance curtail earnings management, and support the underlying
   premise of regulators that improvements in corporate governance would
   improve financial reporting.},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Throughout its history, the industrial engineering/operations management
   (IE/OM) field has relied heavily on axiomatic models and empirical
   studies of individual systems. But, unlike other engineering and
   management disciplines, it lacks a clear foundation in a descriptive
   science. Exceptional results like the famous ``bullwhip effect{''} paper
   by Lee et al. (1997) hint at the powerful potential for a descriptive
   science of operations. But the very fact that such works are exceptional
   suggests that they are held to a high bar in the publishing process.
   This may be symptomatic of the cultural norms that have prevented our
   field from producing a rigorous scientific foundation. In this study, we
   make a case for why developing a unified science of operations is
   essential for IE/OM education, practice and research. We provide
   examples and a tentative framework to illustrate what such a science
   might look like and use this framework to generate a testable hypothesis
   about a powerful relationship between variability buffers in and
   operations system. We conclude with suggestions of measures we can take
   collectively to promote development of the science of operations.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {48},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Recent meta-analytic studies imply that groups often find ways of
   neutralizing turnover's harmful effects and that important moderators of
   the turnover-performance relationship must be missing from the
   literature. Building on theory and findings related to the
   threat-rigidity effect, we suggest that groups tend to respond
   maladaptively to turnover when group norms promote the idea that
   turnover is threatening. Specifically, we suggest that prevention
   climate-that is, a climate focused on minimizing mistakes and
   costs-largely determines the degree to which group norms encourage
   members to view turnover as threatening and, in turn, the degree to
   which groups become less adaptive and perform worse in response to
   turnover. Across a sample of 232 groups, we found evidence that turnover
   is indeed more negatively related to performance for those groups with a
   strong prevention climate. Further, in a controlled laboratory context
   where we manipulated turnover and prevention climate, we found causal
   evidence supporting our full conceptual model. Our work advances
   research on turnover by identifying an important moderator and an
   underlying mechanism of the turnover-performance relationship.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {67},
Number = {3},
Pages = {360-381},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Stakeholders increasingly put pressure on firms to ensure their
   suppliers' adherence to corporate social responsibility principles and
   standards. A firm's supplier monitoring activities (SMA) are, thus,
   central to achieving supply chain transparency. In an effort to help
   build a business case for SMA, this research explores the effect of SMA
   disclosures on consumers' attitude toward the firm and purchase
   intention. In so doing, we also examine how consumer attitude and
   purchase intention vary as a function of SMA disclosure characteristics.
   The results of three behavioral studies reveal more positive consumer
   attitude and higher purchase intention when a firm discloses that its
   supplier monitoring extends to lower-tier suppliers (SMA depth) and the
   firm monitors its lower-tier suppliers directly rather than relying on
   its first-tier suppliers or third parties to do so (lower-tier supplier
   monitoring mechanism). Greater SMA breadth-monitoring both suppliers'
   social and environmental activities-in turn, is not associated with more
   positive consumer attitude and higher purchase intention. Further,
   attitude toward the firm mediates the relationship between SMA
   disclosure characteristics and purchase intention. Collectively, these
   findings underline that consumers value firms' SMA and point toward an
   economic rationale for a firm's transparency regarding its supplier
   monitoring efforts.},

Title = {The track one pilot program: Who benefits from prioritized patent

Volume = {15},

Abstract = {Research Summary Speed is often critical for successful
   commercialization of a new technology, and patents help entrepreneurs
   secure funding, enter the market, and avoid expropriation of their
   ideas. In this article, we employ a recent change to U.S. patent law-the
   introduction of an elective program accelerating patent examination-to
   investigate the role of patent examination speed in strategic
   entrepreneurship. We find that small firms with limited patent
   portfolios are the most likely to expedite their patent applications.
   Moreover, accelerated patents are cited and litigated at higher rates
   than other patents, and these outcomes are more sensitive to exogenous
   changes to patent scope. Our results suggest that providing the option
   to accelerate patent examination may help increase incentives for
   innovation by strategic entrepreneurs.
   Managerial Summary Patents are essential to high-tech businesses,
   helping them to secure funding and exclude competitors from the
   marketplace. We evaluate a USPTO pilot program that allowed patent
   applicants to accelerate patent examination, yielding a patent in less
   than 1 year when typically 3 or more years are required. We find that
   entrepreneurs are more likely to use the program than large firms.
   Moreover, patents examined under the program tend to be strategically
   important. They are litigated and cited at higher rates than other
   patents, and the scope of the patents' claims plays a key role in these
   outcomes. Collectively our results suggest that multi-track patent
   examination programs are likely to have a positive effect on generating
   new ideas, increasing value capture for entrepreneurs, and facilitating
   the growth of small businesses. Our results also suggest that the USPTO
   has implemented the program successfully by accelerating examination
   without sacrificing quality.},

Abstract = {We exploit the staggered introduction of CPA Mobility provisions in the
   United States to study the effects of spatial licensing requirements on
   the labor market for accounting professionals. Specifically, we examine
   whether the removal of licensing-induced geographic barriers affects CPA
   wages and employment levels, as well as the pricing and quality of
   professional services. We find that, subsequent to the adoption of CPA
   Mobility provisions, wages of accounting professionals decrease, whereas
   employment levels are unaffected. The documented wage effect stems from
   smaller CPA firms, is more pronounced for CPAs holding senior positions,
   and persists over time. We also find that service prices decline and
   that this effect is concentrated in local CPA firms. Moreover, we
   document that the increased wage and price pressure is not associated
   with deteriorating service quality. Collectively, our results suggest
   that the removal of occupational licensing barriers has sizable effects
   on labor supply and service prices. Our findings inform the current
   regulatory debate on occupational licensing.},

Abstract = {Promoting contribution of content is a key challenge for platforms that
   support the collective creation or transfer of knowledge. We use a field
   experiment on a massive open online course to study the role of forum
   size (number of people in a forum) in the contribution of content per
   person. We find that larger forums elicit more contributions per person.
   The number of questions and other help-seeking threads posted per person
   was unchanged by forum size, but replies and other more conversational
   posts increased sharply. Most of the positive effect of size was in a
   subset of socially responsive subjects. The implication of social
   responsiveness driving our results is that the unequal distribution of
   contribution in online platforms is unlikely to be easily changed: if
   more contributions are elicited from infrequent contributors, the
   greatest contributors would contribute even more because there would be
   more to respond to.},

   contestation in the field. Second, we identify four different
   perspectives that have been developed in OMS (functional, interpretive,
   critical and performative) and expand upon each perspective by
   showcasing articles published over the past decade. In particular, we
   examine four papers previously published in Organization Studies to show
   the distinctiveness of each perspective. Finally, we identify a number

Abstract = {The digitization, digitalization, and datafication of work and
   communication, coupled with social and technical infrastructures that
   enable connectivity, are making it increasingly easy for the behaviors
   of people, collectives, and technological devices to see and be seen.
   Such digital connectivity gives rise to the important phenomenon of
   behavioral visibility. We argue that studying the antecedents,
   processes, and consequences of behavioral visibility should be a central
   concern for scholars of organizing. We attempt to set the cornerstones
   for the study of behavioral visibility by considering the social and
   technological contexts that are enabling behavioral visibility,
   developing the concept of behavioral visibility by defining its various
   components, considering the conditions through which it is commonly
   produced, and outlining potential consequences of behavioral visibility
   in the form of three paradoxes. We conclude with some conjectures about
   the kinds of research questions, empirical foci, and methodological
   strategies that scholars will need to embrace in order to understand how
   behavioral visibility shapes and is shaped by the process of organizing
   as we catapult, swiftly, into an era where artificial intelligence,
   learning algorithms, and social tools are changing the way people work.},

Volume = {44},
Number = {4},
Pages = {1733-1772},

Abstract = {The scholarly information-seeking process for behavioral research
   consists of three phases: searching, accessing, and processing of past
   research. Existing IT artifacts, such as Google Scholar, have in part
   addressed the searching and accessing phases, but fall short of
   facilitating the processing phase, creating a knowledge inaccessibility
   problem. We propose a behavioral ontology learning from text (BOLT)
   design framework that presents concrete prescriptions for developing
   systems capable of supporting researchers during their processing of
   behavioral knowledge. Based upon BOLT, we developed a search
   engine-TheoryOn-to allow researchers to directly search for constructs,
   construct relationships, antecedents, and consequents, and to easily
   integrate related theories. Our design framework and search engine were
   rigorously evaluated through a series of data mining experiments, a
   randomized user experiment, and an applicability check. The data mining
   experiment results lent credence to the design principles prescribed by
   BOLT. The randomized experiment compared TheoryOn with EBSCOhost and
   Google Scholar across four information retrieval tasks, illustrating
   TheoryOn `s ability to reduce false positives and false negatives during
   the information-seeking process. Furthermore, an in-depth applicability
   check with IS scholars offered qualitative support for the efficacy of
   an ontology-based search and the usefulness of TheoryOn during the
   processing phase of existing research. The evaluation results
   collectively underscore the significance of our proposed design
   artifacts for addressing the knowledge inaccessibility problem for
   behavioral research literature.},

Abstract = {Multiple theories addressing firms' reactions to exchange partner
   misconduct coalesce to depict a trade-off. On the one hand, maintaining
   commitments to transgressors poses negative spillover risks, so theories
   posit firms are more likely to avoid such risks by ending commitments as
   negative spillover rises. On the other hand, exchange relationships
   often create embedded value, so theorizing also posits firms are more
   likely to avoid risking loss by maintaining commitments as relationships
   are more embedded. We argue this ``maintain or end{''} choice
   oversimplifies a complex situation in which there are mixed gambles
   (i.e., choices offering both positive and negative outcomes). We
   integrate theorizing on mixed gambles and negative spillover to develop
   a broader conceptualization of alternative strategies for firms to
   reconcile these risk trade-offs beyond a binary ``maintain or end{''}
   reaction, theorizing firms may: (a) increase or decrease commitments to
   transgressors, (b) hedge against risks by adding new partners while
   maintaining existing ones, or (c) ``boomerang{''} by restarting exchange
   after previously ending commitments. Using firms' relationships with
   politicians accused of misconduct to test our arguments, findings
   support our theorizing. Collectively, we offer a more complete
   understanding of firms' reactions to exchange partner misconduct,
   extending theory and practical knowledge in multiple ways.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we examine the relationships between three of the Big 5

   agreeableness) and willingness to justify unethical behavior. We also
   consider the moderating relationship of four of the GLOBE cultural
   dimensions (institutional collectivism, humane orientation, performance
   orientation, and assertiveness) on the above relationship. We tested our
   propositions on a sample of 38,655 individuals from 23 different
   countries obtained from the latest data available from the World Values
   Survey Group's survey (WVS 2014). We found that conscientiousness and
   agreeableness were both negatively associated with willingness to
   justify unethical behavior. We also conducted Hierarchical Linear
   Modeling and found significant interaction effects of selected GLOBE
   cultural dimensions (humane orientation, assertiveness, institutional
   collectivism, and performance orientation) on the relationships between
   personality traits and willingness to justify unethical behavior. We
   provide managerial implications of our findings, as well as suggestions

Abstract = {High investor sentiment has been linked with opportunistic managerial
   behavior in the face of more optimistic investors and analysts. We
   extend this line of work by documenting that the likelihood of
   misstatements is higher when sentiment is high. Although this would
   suggest elevated audit risk, we posit that a contemporaneous reduction
   in auditors' litigation cost could drive down audit fees and going
   concern opinion (GCO) reporting conservatism in order to please
   clientele. Consistent with this notion, we document that auditors charge
   lower fees and report GCOs less conservatively when sentiment is high.
   However, this reduction in reporting conservatism is unwarranted;
   results reveal that auditors are less likely to issue GCOs to clients
   which subsequently file for bankruptcy during high sentiment periods. We
   conduct additional tests to examine whether auditors' litigation costs
   indeed vary with sentiment and document that auditors are less likely to
   be sued and the market reacts less negatively to misstatement
   announcements when sentiment is high. Collectively, our findings suggest
   that, although misstatement risk is increasing with sentiment, auditors'
   litigation risk actually declines.},

Abstract = {The growing relevance of improvisation for successful organizing calls
   for a better understanding of how individuals develop improvisation
   skills. While research has investigated the role of training and
   simulations, little is known about how individuals develop improvisation
   skills when formal training is not an option and how individual-level
   factors shape development trajectories. We explore these issues in a
   longitudinal qualitative analysis of live action role-playing. Our
   findings reveal a three-stage process of improvisation development
   shaped by the presence of task and social structures, which act as both
   constraints and resources. Moreover, our findings illuminate how
   collaborative and competitive orientations shape whether improvisers
   perceive these structures as a resource that they need to nurture and
   renew (i.e., collaborative) or to seize and exploit (i.e., competitive).
   We also show that individual orientations are not always enduring but
   can change over time, engendering four types of improvisation
   development trajectories. Our work provides a longitudinal account of
   how individual orientations shape the process of improvisation
   development. In so doing, we also explain why individuals who are
   skilled improvisers do not necessarily improvise effectively as a
   collective, and we reconcile different conceptualizations of
   improvisation.},

Abstract = {The Sharing Economy (SE) has demonstrated unprecedented capability in

   rise of digital applications and changes in consumption attitudes, the
   effectiveness of this governance structure is not uniform across
   contexts. We analyse the roles of disparate actors in the SE and the
   relationships among them, in order to identify the contexts under which
   the SE is most likely to be the effective governance structure compared
   with traditional governance structures such as markets and firms, and
   new governance structures such as other platform economies and
   collaborative ecosystems. Two comparison frameworks are developed to
   illustrate the contextual factors that determine the effectiveness of
   the SE vis-a-vis other governance structures.},

Abstract = {Practitioners often claim that takeover pressure induces managerial
   myopia (short-termism), but academic research provides limited empirical
   evidence supporting this assertion. Our study fills this void by
   investigating how takeover threat influences managers'
   resource-adjustment decisions. Specifically, we exploit the staggered
   enactments of merger and acquisition laws across countries as exogenous
   shocks that facilitate takeover transactions and increase takeover
   threat. While we find some evidence that takeover laws deter managers
   from acquiring and retaining excess resources (market discipline), we
   find more prevailing evidence that such law enactments induce managers
   to pursue short-term profits through underinvesting in resources meant
   to create long-term value (managerial myopia). Cross-country analyses
   reveal that the effect of takeover legislation on resource adjustments
   is concentrated in countries with weak investor protection and in
   countries with short-term-oriented culture. Consistent with managerial
   myopia, we also find that corporate resources contribute less to the
   long-term value in the post-enactment period, and that firm
   profitability improves immediately after the enactment, but then
   gradually reverts to the pre-enactment level. Collectively, our evidence
   suggests that policymakers, corporate boards, investors, and
   researchers, when assessing the net effects of takeover threats, should
   consider both the downside of inciting myopic behavior and the upside of
   tightening managerial discipline.},

Abstract = {Despite substantial scholarly attention to workforce demographic
   diversity, existing research is limited in understanding whether or in
   what contexts firm-level racial diversity relates to performance and
   workforce outcomes of the firm. Drawing on social interdependence theory
   along with insights from social exchange and psychological ownership
   theories, we propose that the use of broad-based stock options granted
   to at least half the workforce creates the conditions supporting a
   positive relationship between workforce racial diversity and firm
   outcomes. We examine this proposition by analyzing panel data from 155
   companies that applied for the ``100 Best Companies to Work For{''}
   competition with responses from 109,314 employees over the five-year
   period from 2006 to 2010 (354 company-year observations). Findings
   revealed that racial diversity was positively related to subsequent firm
   financial performance and individual affective commitment and was not
   significantly associated with subsequent voluntary turnover rates, when
   accompanied by a firm's adoption of broad-based stock options. However,
   under the nonuse of broad-based stock options, racial diversity was
   significantly related to higher voluntary turnover rates and lower
   employee affective commitment, with no financial performance gains. By
   documenting the beneficial effects of financial incentives in diverse
   workplaces, this paper extends theory asserting the value of incentives
   for performance.},

Abstract = {A crucial challenge for organizations is to pool and aggregate
   information effectively. Traditionally, organizations have relied on
   committees and teams, but recently many organizations have explored the
   use of information markets. In this paper, the authors compared groups
   and markets in their ability to pool and aggregate information in a
   hidden-profiles task. In Study 1, groups outperformed markets when there
   were no conflicts of interest among participants, whereas markets
   outperformed groups when conflicts of interest were present. Also,
   participants had more trust in groups to uncover hidden profiles than in
   markets. Study 2 generalized these findings to a simple prediction task,
   confirming that people had more trust in groups than in markets. These
   results were not qualified by conflicts of interest. Drawing on
   experienced forecasters from Good Judgment Open, Study 3 found that
   familiarity and experience with markets increased the endorsement and
   use of markets relative to traditional committees.},

   that is used by the Toquaht Nation to evaluate the potential and actual
   impacts of community-based en-trepreneurial opportunities across
   multiple dimensions of well-being. By elaborating a notion of collective

Abstract = {Although the service-profit chain posits that employees and customers
   are interrelated at the unit level (Heskett, Sasser, \& Schlesinger,
   1997), most theory and practice give primary emphasis to the employee.
   In this study, we sought to draw attention to the relatively neglected
   influence that customers may collectively have on employees.
   Specifically, we examined how collective customer perceptions of service
   quality relate to collective employee job satisfaction, service climate,
   and collective turnover (voluntary and involuntary). Using a sample of
   294 bank branches, 1,975 employees, and 52,920 customers, modeled at the
   branch level over 2 years, we found that collective customer perceptions
   of service quality produced a stronger effect on collective employee job
   satisfaction and service climate than vice versa. We also provided the
   first tests demonstrating that collective customer perceptions of
   service quality significantly and independently influence collective
   voluntary turnover, even while simultaneously modeling collective
   employee job satisfaction and service climate. Further, we showed that
   the effects of collective turnover (voluntary and involuntary) are
   primarily related to collective customer perceptions and service
   climate, but through different paths. Although the turnover base rates
   are modest, these empirical findings highlight the role that collective
   customer perceptions can have in shaping collective employee attitudes,
   climate, and turnover and, thus, should be considered and replicated in
   future theory and research.},

Abstract = {This article develops a search theory of labour unions in which the
   possibility of unionization distorts the behaviour of non-union firms.
   In the model, unions arise endogenously through a majority election
   within firms. As union wages are set through a collective bargaining
   process, unionization compresses wages and lowers profits. To prevent
   unionization, non-union firms over-hire high-skill workers-who vote
   against the union-and under-hire low-skill workers-who vote in its
   favour. As a consequence of this distortion in hiring, firms that are
   threatened by unionization hire fewer workers, produce less and pay a
   more concentrated distribution of wages. In the calibrated economy, the
   threat of unionization has a significant negative impact on aggregate
   output, but it also reduces wage inequality.},

Journal = {ORGANIZATION SCIENCE},

Volume = {31},
Number = {6},
Pages = {1336-1358},

Abstract = {Viewing entrepreneurship as a form of collective action, this paper
   investigates the tension between an entrepreneurial team's reliance on
   collective efforts for achieving success and individual members'
   tendencies to withhold their personal resources. We argue that the
   precarious nature of the early founding stage and the difficulty of
   redeploying some resources for other uses amplify the risk of
   early-stage resource contributions and may lead to team members
   withholding resources or even free riding. Two conditions may help
   overcome such collective action problems: adopting a formal contract to
   specify rewards and sanctions and encouraging reciprocal exchange among
   team members through the lead entrepreneur's voluntary contributions.
   Analyzing a nationally representative multiwave panel study of
   entrepreneurial teams in the United States, we show that early-stage
   team members are reluctant to provide resources tailored to the
   business, even though such resources are critical to venture survival.
   We find that presigned formal contracts and founding entrepreneurs'
   initial contributions make members' contributions of such resources much
   more likely. Lead entrepreneurs' voluntary contributions to their
   businesses, signified by their provision of resources that impose high
   risks on themselves but increase the viability of the business, help
   mitigate collective action problems within entrepreneurial teams.},

Title = {Statistics and Probability Have Always Been Value-Laden: An Historical

Journal = {JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ETHICS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {167},
Number = {1},
Pages = {1-18},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Quantitative researchers often discuss research ethics as if specific
   ethical problems can be reduced to abstract normative logics (e.g.,
   virtue ethics, utilitarianism, deontology). Such approaches overlook how
   values are embedded in every aspect of quantitative methods, including
   `observations,' `facts,' and notions of `objectivity.' We describe how
   quantitative research practices, concepts, discourses, and their
   objects/subjects of study have always been value-laden, from the
   invention of statistics and probability in the 1600s to their subsequent
   adoption as a logic made to appear as if it exists prior to, and
   separate from, ethics and values. This logic, which was embraced in the
   Academy of Management from the 1960s, casts management researchers as
   ethical agents who ought to know about a reality conceptualized as
   naturally existing in the image of statistics and probability (replete
   with `constructs'), while overlooking that S\&P logic and practices,
   which researchers made for themselves, have an appreciable role in
   making the world appear this way. We introduce a different way to
   conceptualize reality and ethics, wherein the process of scientific
   inquiry itself requires an examination of its own practices and
   commitments. Instead of resorting to decontextualized notions of `rigor'
   and its `best practices,' quantitative researchers can adopt more
   purposeful ways to reason about the ethics and relevance of their
   methods and their science. We end by considering implications for
   addressing `post truth' and `alternative facts' problems as collective
   concerns, wherein it is actually the pluralistic nature of description
   that makes defending a collectively valuable version of reality so
   important and urgent.},

Abstract = {We study recycling technology choice, a critical factor that has
   received little attention in the context of extended producer
   responsibility, and its interaction with product design-for-recycling in
   driving the environmental benefits of recycling systems. Collective
   recycling systems have long been criticized for restricting the
   environmental benefits of extended producer responsibility because of
   free riding issues among producers, which can undermine incentives for
   product design-for-recycling. We revisit and refine this assertion by
   analyzing the interaction between recycling technology and product
   design-for-recycling choices. We develop game-theoretic models where
   producers and processors decide on product design-for-recycling and
   recycling technology choices, respectively. We then compare the
   equilibrium benefits of recycling in collective and individual systems.
   The key result in this study is that when recycling technology choice is
   taken into account, collective recycling systems can lead to higher
   environmental and economic benefits than individual recycling systems.
   This is because collective recycling systems provide stronger incentives
   for recycling technology improvements. In turn, these improvements can
   help overcome the drawbacks associated with inferior product
   design-for-recycling outcomes caused by free riding concerns among
   producers in collective recycling systems. In light of these results, we
   posit that an exclusive focus on product design-for-recycling to assess
   the environmental benefits of extended producer responsibility-based
   recycling systems may need scrutiny. Producers and policy makers may
   need to evaluate recycling systems with respect to the incentives they
   provide for both product design-for-recycling and recycling technology
   improvements.},

Title = {The Use and Characteristics of Foreign Component Auditors in US
   Multinational Audits: Insights from FormAPDisclosures},

Abstract = {This paper investigates the common, yet previously opaque, practice of
   using foreign audit firms (component auditors) to conduct portions of
   audit work for U.S. public companies. U.S. regulators have expressed
   concern for the transparency and quality of audits using component
   auditors. Employing data disclosed in the newly mandated PCAOB Form AP,
   we find that component auditor use is largely structural, determined by
   the size and complexity of clients' multinational operations. We do not
   find that the mere use of component auditors is detrimental to audit
   outcomes, but rather theamountof work conducted by component auditors is
   associated with lower audit quality (i.e., higher likelihood of
   misstatement), higher likelihood of nontimely reporting, and higher
   audit fees, which collectively suggest that component auditor
   engagements are associated with adverse outcomes. Furthermore, we find
   that only the work performed by less competent component auditors and
   those facing geographic and cultural/language barriers, including
   significant geographic and cultural distance, weak rule of law, and low
   English language proficiency, is associated with adverse audit outcomes.
   Overall, these findings provide initial archival evidence that the use
   of certain component auditors on U.S. multinational audits is associated
   with audit coordination issues, which suggests that PCAOB Form AP
   disclosures provide relevant information.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF ACCOUNTING RESEARCH},

Volume = {58},

Abstract = {We examine the causal effect of managerial litigation risk on managers'
   disclosure of earnings warnings in the face of large earnings
   shortfalls. Exploring the staggered adoption of universal demand (UD)
   laws as an exogenous decrease in litigation risk, we find that the
   adoption leads to a decrease in managers' issuance of earnings warnings,
   especially among firms facing a higher litigation risk prior to the
   adoption. In contrast, we find no change in managers' tendency to alert
   investors of impending large positive earnings surprises. Collectively,
   our results provide causal evidence that higher litigation risk
   incentivizes managers to issue more earnings warnings. Our results
   differ from Bourveau et al.'s finding of an increase in the frequency of
   management earnings forecasts after the adoption of UD laws. We
   reconcile our findings with theirs by demonstrating that the effect of
   adopting UD laws on management earnings forecasts depends critically on
   forecast horizon: The adoption increases long-horizon forecasts, but
   decreases short-horizon forecasts.},

Abstract = {The upward voicing of ideas is vital to organizational performance. Yet
   power differences between voicers and those with authority may result in
   valuable ideas being overlooked. In this ethnographic, 31-month
   longitudinal study of a multi-disciplinary team in the healthcare
   sector, we examine how upwardly voiced ideas can endure to reach
   implementation. Of 208 upwardly voiced ideas, most were rejected in the
   moment, but 49 reached implementation despite appearing to be initially
   rejected. These ideas were kept alive by other team members who later
   drew upon and revived the initial ideas through what we call the voice
   cultivation process. We detail this process and describe five pathways
   through which voiced ideas stayed alive to reach implementation by
   overcoming different forms of resistance. We illustrate how the allyship
   of others can help voice live on beyond its initial utterance to reach
   implementation and generate change, even when the person who initially
   spoke up is no longer on the team or advocating for the idea. By
   reconceptualizing voice as a collective, interactional process rather
   than a one-time dyadic event, this paper develops new theory on how
   employees can help one another's voice be heard to positively impact
   their teams and organizations.},

Abstract = {We review different streams of social science literature on privacy with
   the goal of understanding consumer privacy decision making and deriving
   implications for policy. We focus on psychological and economic factors
   influencing both consumers' desire and consumers' ability to protect
   their privacy, either through individual action or through the
   implementation of regulations applying to firms. Contrary to depictions
   of online sharing behaviors as careless, we show how consumers
   fundamentally care about online privacy, and present evidence of
   numerous actions they take to protect it. However, we also document how
   prohibitively difficult it is to attain desired, or even desirable,
   levels of privacy through individual action alone. The remaining
   instrument for privacy protection is policy intervention. However, again
   for both psychological and economic reasons, the collective impetus for
   adequate intervention is often countervailed by powerful interests that
   oppose it.},

Abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic and the accompanying economic downturn have
   dramatically impacted the lives of consumers around the world. From a
   conceptual perspective, such health and economic threats can severely
   disrupt consumers' sense of ontological security and elicit adaptive
   responses by both consumers and marketers. Given the opportune timing,
   this issue of the Journal of Consumer Research is focused on articles
   that address questions of consumers' responses to external threats. The
   purpose of this introduction is to provide an organizing ``conceptual
   tapestry{''} to connect the articles appearing in the issue. This
   framework is provided as a tool to help researchers structure their
   particular projects within the broader landscape of consumer threat
   response and to present some potential directions for future research.
   In conjunction with these articles, we hope that this conceptual
   framework will provide a point of departure for researchers seeking to
   enhance the understanding of how consumers and markets collectively
   respond over the short term and long term to threats that disrupt
   consumers' routines, lives, or even the fabric of society.},

Abstract = {Using a novel database that tracks web traffic on the Security Exchange
   Commission's EDGAR server between 2004 and 2015, we show that
   institutional investors gather information on a very particular subset
   of firms and insiders, and their surveillance is very persistent over
   time. This tracking behavior has powerful implications for their
   portfolio choice and its information content. An institution that
   downloaded an insider trading filing by a given firm last quarter
   increases its likelihood of downloading an insider trading filing on the
   same firm by more than 41.3 percentage points this quarter. Moreover,
   the average tracked stock that an institution buys generates annualized
   alphas of over 12\% relative to the purchase of an average non tracked
   stock. We find that institutional managers tend to track top executives
   and to share educational and locational commonalities with the specific
   insiders they choose to follow. Collectively, our results suggest that
   the information in tracked trades is important for fundamental firm
   value and is only revealed following the information-rich dual trading
   by insiders and linked institutions. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {This paper builds on recent calls for a polyphonic approach to study
   rhetorical uses of the past, to account for multiple and diverse voices
   that take part in the construction of collective memories. To this end,
   I explore (multiple) collective memories of a charity's founding story
   by tracing how this story was retold in the organization. My findings
   demonstrate that these recollected stories were localized and
   embellished within two specific mnemonic communities. I show that two
   different renditions of the founding story projected social fantasies
   shared by members of respective mnemonic communities, who used the
   telling of the story to reaffirm what they thought is the core purpose
   of the organization and their role. This finding is used to discuss how
   multiple collective memories sustain different identities in
   organizations. The research further discusses the mutual role of social
   fantasies in maintaining collective memories in organizations and vice
   versa.},

Abstract = {We argue that privacy's political strength rests in its ``economic dark
   matter{''} (p. 27)-its role in protecting individual autonomy, freedom,
   dignity, fairness, the collective value of privacy and the integrity of
   social life. Where privacy construed as diffuse, atomistic interests in
   informational control often fails to motivate political action, privacy
   as constitutive of society and in service of ``important {[}social]
   functions{''} succeeds. While Acquisti et al correctly describe the
   state of our current political economy as having left no space for
   privacy as a lived, intuitive, human practice, we believe those same
   conditions are fostering a resurgence of interest in privacy as a means
   to address the wealth of harms these conditions produce. We close with a
   call for regulatory approaches that develop institutions, tools, and
   actors that can iteratively shape the corporate, social, and political
   landscape to protect the collective, public, and social value of privacy
   in the public interest.},

Journal = {HUMAN RELATIONS},

Abstract = {Leadership is a process whereleaders enact certain behaviors to
   influence followers. Yet, each follower may view the leader's enactment
   differently, owing to differences in disposition and context. Here we
   examine leadership as a propertyattributed by followers to their leader,
   influenced by both the leader and followers' personal attributes and the
   situation in which leaders and followers interact. Guiding this study,
   we asked: how do followers' affect (negative and positive traits),
   motivation (regulatory focus), and cognitions (identity) and their
   congruence with their leader's corresponding attributes influence their
   ratings of transformational leadership? Participants operated in extreme
   situations where their lives were often at risk because of exposure to
   combat. Results based on a sample of 1587 US Army soldiers operating in
   262 units show that when there is a higher congruence between leaders'
   and followers' positive affect, promotion focus, relational identity,
   and collective identity, follower ratings of transformational leadership
   are higher, whereas a higher level of incongruence between followers'
   and leaders' positive and negative affect predicted lower ratings of
   transformational leadership. These findings differed based on the
   soldiers' time spent in deployment and the level of combat exposure they
   experienced.},

Journal = {ORGANIZATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {31},
Number = {5},
Pages = {1220-1247},

Abstract = {This paper explores the everyday practices, forms, and means by which
   employees mobilize national identity as a tool of resistance in opposing
   managerial demands of their dual, global/Western and local/Japanese,
   organizational identity. Drawing on an ethnographic study of a Japanese
   subsidiary of a multinational corporation, we show how employees use
   national identity to invoke three forms of othering in constructing
   various resistant identities: individual employees' resistant identities
   through verbal othering, expressed in employees' talk; departmental
   resistant identities through spatial othering, referring to employees'
   use of space; and subsidiary resistant identity through ritual othering,
   illustrating employees' collective use of ritual practices and symbolic
   artifacts. Our study makes three significant theoretical contributions:
   First, by illustrating the ways and means by which employees take on
   different national identities to construct diverse and often
   contradictory resistant identities to their expected dual organizational
   identity, we highlight the changeable nature of national identity.
   Second, this study contributes to our understanding of contextual
   constituents that shape individuals' identity-related resistance. By
   unraveling employees' various resistance forms, we show how resistance
   dynamically takes on assorted manifestations according to the
   organizational level in which it occurs and the managerial demands being
   resisted. Third, we illustrate the constitutive resources of resistance
   by highlighting the diverse means used by employees to construct their
   resistant identities.},

Title = {Inflexible Repositioning: Commitment in Competition and Uncertainty},
Journal = {MANAGEMENT SCIENCE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {66},
Number = {9},
Pages = {4207-4225},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {We study the value of commitment in a business environment that is both
   competitive and uncertain, in which two firms face stochastic demands
   and compete in positioning and repositioning. If the future demand tends
   to disperse or the demand uncertainty is sufficiently large, one firm
   chooses rigidity (i.e., commits not to change its positions), and the
   other chooses flexibility (i.e., to reposition freely). We find that a
   firm's rigidity can benefit not only itself, but also its flexible
   rival. When uncertainty is larger, rigidity becomes more valuable
   relative to flexibility. These results arise because the asymmetric
   equilibrium generates two collective gains in addition to the usual
   individual gain (in terms of competitive advantages) accrued to the
   committing firm. A firm's rigid repositioning can soften competition and
   generate a commitment value, and the other firm's flexible repositioning
   generates an option value. Both values then spill over to competitors
   within the ecosystem. These results suggest that, when firms compete
   under uncertainty, commitment and options are valuable not only for the
   party that is making the choice, but also for all competing parties
   collectively. Commitment value and option value do not have to be
   mutually exclusive; they can coexist and even strengthen each other
   through unilateral commitment, which achieves the best of both
   strategies.},

Abstract = {Professional service firms (PSFs) are characterized by contingent and
   contested power relations among an extended group of professional peers.
   Studies of such firms can therefore yield important insights for the
   literatures on collective leadership and leader-follower relations. Yet
   to date PSF scholars have neglected the topic of leadership, and
   leadership scholars have neglected the context of PSFs. Based on 102
   interviews across the consulting, accounting and legal sectors, we
   identify three relational processes through which professional peers
   co-construct collective leadership: legitimizing, negotiating and
   manoeuvring. We demonstrate how the relational processes taken together
   constitute an unstable equilibrium, both in the moment and over time,
   emphasizing how leadership in PSFs is inherently contested and fragile.
   Our model contributes to theories of collective leadership and
   leader-follower relations by foregrounding the power and politics that
   underlie collective leadership. We highlight the significance of the
   individual leader within the collective. We challenge assumptions
   concerning the binary nature of leadership and followership, by showing
   how colleagues may grant leadership identities to their peers without
   necessarily granting them leadership authority, and without claiming
   follower identities for themselves.},

Abstract = {Initial coin offerings (ICOs) have emerged as a new mechanism for
   entrepreneurial finance, with parallels to initial public offerings,
   venture capital, and presale crowdfunding. In a sample of more than
   1,500 ICOs that collectively raise \$12.9 billion, we examine which
   issuer and ICO characteristics predict successful real outcomes
   (increasing issuer employment and avoiding enterprise failure). Success
   is associated with disclosure, credible commitment to the project, and
   quality signals. An instrumental variables analysis finds that ICO token
   exchange listing causes higher future employment, indicating that access
   to token liquidity has important real consequences for the enterprise.},

Title = {Collaborative Market Driving: How Peer Firms Can Develop Markets Through
   Collective Action},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MARKETING},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {84},
Number = {5},
Pages = {41-59},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Firms often aim to develop markets as part of their long-term
   strategies. Conventionally, research in marketing has explained this
   complex process by stressing firms' efforts to outdo their peers. While
   this emphasis is valuable, it overlooks the role of another major force
   in market evolution: collective action among peer firms. To address this
   oversight, this article conceptualizes ``collaborative market
   driving,{''} defining it as the collective strategy in which peer firms
   consistently cooperate among themselves and with other actors to develop
   markets in ways that increase their overall competitiveness. This
   conceptualization includes the triggers that lead peer firms to mobilize
   for collective action and coalesce with other market actors; it also
   identifies how this coalition converts collective resources into
   market-driving power. These theoretical contributions, based on a
   multimethod analysis of the rise of U.S. craft breweries, offer an
   alternative course of action for firms interested in driving new markets
   when they lack adequate resources to do so individually.},

Title = {The commons: A model for understanding collective action and
   entrepreneurship in communities},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BUSINESS VENTURING},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {35},
Number = {5},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The creation of commons-resources that are shared, accessible, and
   collectively owned and managed by communities-is increasingly being
   adopted by social entrepreneurs as a way of contributing to community
   development and putting value into economic activities. Yet, little
   research is evident related to the entrepreneurial processes involved in
   the creation and commercialization of these shared resources. Drawing on
   the Institutional Analysis and Development framework developed by Ostrom
   (2005), I explain how commons are entrepreneurially created. Based on a
   comparative study of five community banks in Brazil, I derive two
   ideological principles of collective entrepreneurship that help sustain
   commercialization of commons without commodification, namely
   `self-organization' and `right to access'. I elucidate how these
   principles are enacted across venture levels through downward and upward
   mechanisms of social control facilitated by entrepreneurs who enhance
   collective action. This article contributes to the entrepreneurship
   theory of commons by explaining how commons are entrepreneurially
   created and by adding the collective entrepreneurship principles and
   mechanisms that commons of different types need in order to achieve and
   sustain wealth-creation options without incurring the downsides of
   commodification.},

Title = {Who Calls It? Actors and Accounts in the Social Construction of
   Organizational Moral Failure},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ETHICS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {165},
Number = {4},
Pages = {699-717},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {In recent years, research on morality in organizational life has begun
   to examine how organizational conduct comes to be socially constructed
   as having failed to comply with a community's accepted morals.
   Researchers in this stream of research, however, have paid little
   attention to identifying and theorizing the key actors involved in these
   social construction processes and the types of accounts they construct.
   In this paper, we explore a set of key structural and cultural
   dimensions of apparent noncompliance that enable us to distinguish
   between four categories of actors who engage in constructing the label
   of moral failure: dominant insiders, watchdog organizations,
   professional members, and publics. The analysis further clarifies which
   category of actor is more likely to succeed in constructing the label of
   moral failure under which circumstances, and what accounts they are
   likely to use, namely scapegoating, prototyping, shaming, and
   protesting.},

Title = {The artisans' dilemma: Artisan entrepreneurship and the challenge of
   firm growth},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BUSINESS VENTURING},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {35},
Number = {5},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {An increasing number of entrepreneurial ventures are growing at
   exponential rates despite their founders' professed intentions not to
   grow their firms. We refer to these individuals as artisan
   entrepreneurs. Through an inductive, phenomenon-based research approach,
   we explore how artisan entrepreneurs subscribe to a
   counter-institutional identity yet engage in a divergent set of
   behaviors. We discover that artisans' counter-institutional identity
   contains two sides-promoting the exclusion of `who we are not'
   (oppositional identity) or providing support for `who we are'
   (relational identity). We theorize that artisan entrepreneurs' differing
   views regarding their independence led to very different approaches to
   growth. When artisans either do not see forms of external control as
   impinging on their independence or sense that serving stakeholders is a
   means to perform relational identity work, they embrace growth. Thus,
   artisans may find that growth serves stakeholders, but funding growth
   brings about financial pressures, which may force the artisan down a
   path of growth.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {47},

Abstract = {An organizational coalition consists of individuals who, despite their
   persistent differences, work together to pursue a mutually beneficial
   goal. While central to the political view of the firm, the research on
   organizational coalitions has evoked diverse characterizations of its
   members, their relationship with the rest of the organization, and how
   coalitions balance conflicts and compromise. The result is a fragmented
   literature that has limited the theoretical clarity necessary to
   appreciate one of the most important forms of collective political
   influence in organizations. Drawing on six decades of research, we offer
   a systematic review of organizational coalitions. We anchor our review
   on the actors who are party to a coalition, the structures that
   characterize the boundaries of a coalition, and the processes that lead
   to a coalition's influence. This synthesis reveals significant overlaps
   with regard to the definition of actors, their structural positions, and
   the perpetual nature of conflict and negotiations. Yet we also note
   significant divergence in the interactions between actors, how the
   structure of a coalition maps onto that of an organization, and the
   processes that affect a coalition's bargaining position and outcomes.
   These divergences reveal six distinct streams of research. Using our
   actor-structure-process model, we organize these research streams into a
   framework that identifies the diverse conceptualizations as contextual
   and reconcilable manifestations of a common underlying construct, thus
   yielding a dynamic model of organizational coalitions. Building on this
   framework, we propose an agenda for future research.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS STUDIES},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {52},
Number = {3},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {This study advances our understanding of the contextualization of the
   effects of cultural intelligence (CQ). Drawing from trait activation
   theory and institutional theory, we develop a multi-level model showing
   how host countries' informal and formal openness towards foreigners
   facilitate or constrain the importance of expatriates' CQ in becoming
   embedded in the host organization. Furthermore, this study positions
   organizational embeddedness as a mediator in the association between
   expatriates' CQ and a central element of expatriates' jobs - knowledge
   sharing in the foreign workplace. Results from a cross-lagged survey of
   1327 expatriates from 100 different nations residing in 30 host
   countries combined with secondary data indicate expatriate CQ relates
   positively to organizational embeddedness. Cross-level interaction
   analyses further suggest that in-group collectivism, the proxy for host
   countries' informal openness towards foreigners, facilitates the
   importance of CQ as a predictor of expatriates' organizational
   embeddedness. In contrast, CQ was not found to interact with the proxy
   for host countries' formal openness towards foreigners, i.e. national
   immigration policies. Consistent with predictions, we identified that CQ
   relates positively to knowledge sharing and that organizational
   embeddedness carries an indirect effect. We discuss the implications for

Abstract = {In this research, we simultaneously examined the relative applicability
   of person-environment fit and relative deprivation theories in
   explaining the interactive effects of perceived overqualification and
   collectivism cultural orientations on positive outcomes. We hypothesized
   that the negative (positive) influence of perceived overqualification on
   person-environment fit (relative deprivation) will be weaker among
   employees with high collectivism cultural orientation. We also examined
   which of these two different mechanisms would explain the hypothesized
   interactive effects in predicting these workers' citizenship behavior,
   personal initiative, work engagement, and life satisfaction. We tested
   our hypotheses in two studies. In Study 1, we recruited professional
   staff (n = 852) and their coworkers (n = 301) from 95 universities and
   tested our hypotheses in a matched sample of 190 employees and their
   peers. The moderated mediation results supported the idea of
   person-environment fit (but not relative deprivation) as the mechanism
   explaining why collectivism orientations assuaged the negative effects
   of perceived overqualification on these outcomes. We constructively
   replicated these results in Study 2, which was a time-lagged design with
   full-time employees (n = 224). Study 2's results further supported the
   robustness of our model by testing alternative moderators, mediators,
   and outcomes.},

   Multinationals: Ethical Foundations and Construct Validation},

Volume = {176},

Abstract = {Entry of new organizations, including multinational enterprises from
   emerging markets (EMNEs), raises the ethical question of will they
   benefit society. The concept of legitimacy answers this question because
   it is the overall assessment of the appropriateness of organizational
   ends and means. Moreover, gaining legitimacy enables EMNEs to succeed in
   new host countries. Past work examined collective level indicators of
   the legitimacy of MNEs, but recent research recognizes the importance of
   individuals' perceptions as the micro-foundation of legitimacy. This
   study first uses new pragmatism, deontology, and utilitarianism to
   demonstrate that legitimacy is fundamentally an ethical concept-a
   perspective that has been overlooked in management research. Second,
   this study uses a seven-step procedure to develop and validate a measure
   of individuals' perceptions of the legitimacy of Chinese EMNEs operating
   in The Netherlands, a developed country. Six dimensions of legitimacy
   were identified. The study also finds support for this legitimacy
   judgment process linking the dimensions: validating knowledge ->
   propriety judgments -> generalized judgment. This work provides
   additional micro-foundations to research on legitimacy and contributes
   to the ongoing process of construct validation. Future research could
   use the validated measure in other settings and use specific ethical
   theories in depth to refine the concept of legitimacy.},

Title = {Legitimacy Revisited: Disentangling Propriety, Validity, and Consensus},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT STUDIES},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {58},
Number = {3},
Pages = {749-781},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Recent research has conceptualized legitimacy as a multi-level
   phenomenon comprising propriety and validity. Propriety refers to an
   individual evaluator's belief that a legitimacy object is appropriate
   for its social context, whereas validity denotes an institutionalized,
   collective-level perception of appropriateness. In this article, we
   refine this multi-level understanding of legitimacy by adding a third,
   meso-level construct of `consensus', which we define as the agreement
   between evaluators' propriety beliefs. Importantly, validity and
   consensus are distinct and can be incongruent, given that an
   institutionalized perception can hide underlying disagreement.
   Disentangling validity from consensus is a crucial extension of the
   multi-level theory of legitimacy, because it enables an improved
   understanding of the legitimacy processes that precede sudden and
   unanticipated institutional change. In particular, while previous works
   considered revised propriety beliefs as the starting point for
   institutional change, our account emphasizes that the disclosure of the
   actual (vs. merely assumed) belief distribution within a social context
   may instigate institutional change. To study the interplay of propriety,
   validity, and consensus empirically, we propose a set of experimental
   designs specifically geared towards improving knowledge of the role of
   legitimacy and its components in institutional change.},

Abstract = {We study how social connections between top executives of media and
   listed firms affect the properties of media reporting. We find that
   socially connected media are significantly more likely to cover a firm
   than their unconnected counterparts. Their reporting is significantly
   more optimistically toned and contains significantly less information,
   and both of these effects are significantly mitigated when the firm has
   better information environment as represented by greater analyst
   coverage and larger firm size. Additional analyses show that
   characteristics of the underlying news, firm, or media also affect the
   effects of social connections on media reporting properties.
   Collectively, our evidence suggests the impairment of media independence
   when media and firms have social connections and the importance of
   alternative information sources in mitigating this effect.},

Abstract = {In recent years, business ethics and economic scholars have been paying
   greater attention to the development of commons organizing. The latter
   refers to the processes by which communities of people work in common in
   the pursuit of the common good. In turn, this promotes commons
   organizational designs based on collective forms of common goods
   production, distribution, management and ownership. In this paper, we
   build on two main literature streams: (1) the ethical approach based on
   the theory of the common good of the firm in virtue ethics and (2) the
   economic approach based on the theory of institutions for collective
   action developed by Ostrom's research on common-pool resources to avert
   the tragedy of the commons. The latter expands to include the novel
   concepts of new commons, ``commoning{''} and polycentric governance.
   Drawing on the analysis of what is new in these forms of organizing, we
   propose a comprehensive model, highlighting the integration of two sets
   of organizing principles-common good and collective action - and five
   problem-solving processes to explain the main dimensions of commons
   organizing. We contribute to business ethics literature by exploring the
   convergence between the ethical and economic approaches in the
   development of a commons organizing view.},

Abstract = {We introduce the papers in this special issue by providing an
   overarching perspective on the variety in kinds of commons and the
   ethical issues stemming from their diversity. Despite a long history of
   local commons management, recent decades have witnessed a surge of
   scholarly interest in the concept of ``the commons,{''} including a
   growing management literature. This swell was impelled especially by
   Garrett Hardin's paper of 1968, and the body of work generated by Elinor
   Ostrom and her colleagues. However, the term itself has come to be used
   in a variety of ways. To contextualize its ethical dimensions, we map a
   number of commons-related concepts such as common-pool resources, common
   property regime, excludability and subtractability, common-pool resource
   types and commons or ``commoning{''} as a source of production.
   Following a brief summary of papers in this special issue, the essay
   concludes with an identification of implications for research, practice
   and policy.},

Abstract = {This paper explores how women workers in Bangladeshi garment factories
   are misrecognised and not represented in the apparel industry through
   focussing on two enacted collective compliance measure agreements
   adopted by global brands to improve safety and working conditions. Our
   paper draws on Amartya Sen's rights-based approach to capabilities as a
   means of explaining the narratives of women trade union leaders and the
   experiences of women factory workers' status in their workplace and in
   the industry. Specifically, we examine how a strategy of
   misrepresentation and nonrecognition of the women factory workers is
   being played out in the multi-stakeholder initiatives of compliance
   codes which leads to a lack of consideration for the basic human rights
   of the women workers. Our paper contributes to the discussion regarding
   how the politics of ethical procurement becomes visible through an
   exclusionary approach in managing the apparel global production network
   (GPN) despite the favourable consensus regarding the compliance codes.},

Abstract = {As work and organizational realities become increasingly
   ``post-bureaucratic,{''} the conventional and stable bases of a person's
   authority-their position, their expertise, or the acquiescence of a
   subordinate-are eroding. This evolution calls us to revise our
   understanding of authority, and to consider more deeply how it is
   achieved in contexts that are both fluid and fragmented. Building on a
   six-month autoethnography of a consulting assignment, we show that
   authority is a practical, relational, and situated performance. It
   exists in a tension between two mirroring processes-activation and
   passivation-through which relations are either leveraged or downplayed
   to shape the situation and steer collective action. Our study also
   reveals that the performance of authority involves not just people, but
   also a broader range of actants, including artifacts and abstract
   entities. In line with current research on performativity in
   organizations, our findings contribute to the relational program on
   authority and the revelation of its sociomaterial dimension. Thus, we
   provide an action-based understanding of authority that is better suited
   for the study of post-bureaucratic organizing.},

Abstract = {We analyze the economic and financial impact of right-to-work (RTW) laws
   in the US. Using data from collective bargaining agreements, we show
   that there is a decrease in wages for unionized workers after RTW laws.
   Firms increase investment and employment but reduce financial leverage.
   Labor-intensive firms experience higher profits and labor-to-asset
   ratios. Dividends and executive compensation also increase post-RTW. Our
   results are consistent with a canonical theory of the firm augmented
   with an exogenous bargaining power of labor and suggest that RTW laws
   impact corporate policies by decreasing that bargaining power. (C) 2020

Abstract = {This paper introduces a refined approach to conceptualising the commons
   in order to shed new light on cooperative practices. Specifically, it
   proposes the novel concept of Common-Property Assets (CPAs). CPAs are
   exclusively human-made resources owned under common-property ownership
   regimes. Our CPA model combines quantity (the flow of resource units
   available to members) and quality (the impact produced on the community
   by the members' appropriation of the resource flow). While these two
   dimensions are largely pre-existing in the conventional case of natural
   common-pool resources, they directly depend on members' collective
   action in CPAs. We apply this theoretical framework to farm machinery
   sharing agreements-a widespread grassroots cooperative phenomenon in
   agriculture-using a systematic literature review to generalise the
   findings from a sample of 54 studies published from 1950 to 2018. Our
   findings show that in successful CPAs, members endorse and do not
   deviate from a quantity-quality equilibrium that is collectively agreed
   upon. Despite the existence of thresholds for both quantity and quality
   due to (axiological) membership heterogeneity, qualitative changes in
   respect of the common good are possible in CPAs that promote democratic
   practices. Our study has potentially strong implications for developing
   ethics in cooperatives and the sustainable development of communities
   worldwide.},

   Investigation},

Volume = {47},
Number = {8},
Pages = {2135-2168},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Despite tremendous progress toward understanding trust within teams,
   research has predominately conceptualized team trust as a shared group
   construct, focusing almost exclusively on trust magnitude (i.e., mean
   level of trust) while ignoring trust dispersion (i.e., within-team
   differences in trust). As a result, we know little about this critical
   property of team trust, its determinants, and independent impact on team
   outcomes. We address this limitation by examining ``team trust
   consensus{''}-a configural group construct capturing the extent to which
   team members share their levels of trust in the team-as a variable of
   theoretical and empirical interest in its own right. Cross-sectional
   data from a work team sample (Study 1, N = 120) provide initial support
   for our propositions that national culture diversity negatively affects
   trust consensus and that trust consensus positively affects team
   performance. Expanding on these findings, we propose a contingency model
   in which the negative impact of national culture diversity is mitigated
   by team virtuality and collective leadership. Multiwave data from an MBA
   team sample (Study 2, N = 95) offer support for these propositions and
   replicate the positive direct effect of trust consensus on team
   performance. Our findings indicate trust consensus is an important
   predictor of team performance and provide unique insight into the
   factors that jointly influence trust consensus within teams.},

Title = {Debating Ethics or Risks? An Exploratory Study of Audit Partners' Peer
   Consultations About Ethics},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ETHICS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {175},
Number = {4},
Pages = {741-758},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {This qualitative field study is based on interviews with 20 experienced
   audit partners in France and documents the dialogical dimension of
   ethical deliberation in auditing. We ask: do audit partners consult each
   other when faced with an ethical dilemma at work? Who among their peers
   do they prefer to consult and why? Our analysis provides evidence that
   audit partners do not deliberate alone, contrary to what psychological
   experimental research on audit ethics usually postulates. When faced
   with an uncertain situation in terms of professional ethics, they seek
   reassurance by consulting colleagues. Not just any colleagues, however.
   Whom they consult depends on whether they wish to avoid or take measured
   ethical risks. Overall, we find that audit partners approach ethics as a
   personal and collective risk that must be managed in specific ways. This
   study enriches what we know about auditor ethics by helping to shed
   light on what is usually inaccessible to researchers: the questions that
   audit partners ask their peers when faced with uncomfortable ethical
   issues in client engagements before making a decision they find
   acceptable.},

Abstract = {Examining how new forms of currencies diffuse is important to uncover
   their impact on the organization of communities, and thus motivates our
   study of community currencies. Community currencies provide a medium of
   exchange by using alternative banknotes or electronic money, which
   circulates only within particular communities, allowing members to trade
   goods, increase social cohesion, and achieve collective goals. In this
   study, we examine how community currencies help facilitate social
   commons by serving as a setting for building community relationships and
   a catalyst for other social activities beyond market relations. We
   analyze cases of community banks that provide microfinance and issue
   community currencies in Brazil. We find that microfinance entrepreneurs
   who involve a greater diversity of stakeholders from public, private,
   and nonprofit sectors in decision making even prior to startup, while
   also facilitating the formation of supportive social capital from
   diverse cross-sector stakeholders, increase opportunities for developing
   new community currencies. By exploring the implications of
   entrepreneurial actions that promote inclusive participation of diverse
   stakeholders for accomplishing collective goals, our findings are
   relevant for other activities that create a common pool of resources
   while also developing the vitality of the community, including
   initiatives that use cryptocurrencies and other emerging forms of
   currencies for building social commons.},

Abstract = {In the business ethics literature, a commons paradigm orients theorizing
   toward how civil society can promote collaboration and collectively
   govern shared resources, and implicates the common good-the ethics of
   providing social conditions that enable individuals and collectives to
   thrive. In the context of representative democracies, the shared
   resources of a nation can be considered commons, yet these resources are
   governed in a top-down, bureaucratic manner wherein public participation
   is often limited to voting for political leaders. Such governance,
   however, can be motivated by values of solidarity and stewardship, and a
   bottom-up approach to participation, in ways that are consistent with a
   social commons ethos (Meyer and Hudon in J Bus Ethics 160:277-292,
   2019). We employ an inductive methodology focused on successes and
   possibilities, using data from interviews with 93 policy-makers and
   national-level government leaders in 5 democratic countries, and
   observational and archival data. We reveal how governments can
   operationalize a social commons ethos in decision-making. This approach
   to governance involves stakeholder engagement that is Broad, Deep, and
   Continual (BDC). In this model, leaders engage a wide breadth of
   stakeholders, engage them deeply and meaningfully throughout the

Title = {Concern for the Transgressor's Consequences: An Explanation for Why
   Wrongdoing Remains Unreported},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ETHICS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {173},

Abstract = {In the aftermath of shocking workplace scandals, people are often
   baffled when individuals within the organization were aware of clear-cut
   wrongdoing yet did not inform authorities. The current research suggests
   that moral concern for the suffering that a transgressor might face if a
   crime were reported is an under-recognized, powerful force that shapes
   whistleblowing in organizations, particularly when transgressors are
   fellow members of a highly entitative group (i.e., a group that is
   perceived as highly unified). Two experiments show that group
   entitativity heightens concern about possible consequences that the
   transgressor would face if a crime were to be reported, and that this
   concern reduces the likelihood of reporting wrongdoing in organizations
   to authorities. Further, the studies identify a mechanism through which
   concern about the transgressor is heightened in highly entitative
   groups: potential reporters perceive that the transgressor felt remorse
   for their crime. Thus, when fellow members of highly entitative
   organizations commit crimes, people are more likely to imagine that
   these transgressors felt anxiety or guilt about their actions, and this
   prompts greater concern for transgressors in ways that encourage people
   to let them ``off the hook.{''} We discuss the implications of these
   findings for how reporting to authorities can be encouraged within
   highly entitative organizations.},

Abstract = {People may identify with multiple entities at work, but how are
   different foci of identification related and how do they influence
   extra-role work behaviors? Drawing from social identity theory, our
   article examines: (a) the potential bidirectional relationship between
   leader and organizational identification; (b) the mediating role of
   organizational identification on the relationship between leader
   identification and organizational citizenship behavior
   (organization-targeted, OCBO); and (c) the moderating role of collective
   identity orientation on the indirect relationship between leader
   identification and OCBO via organizational identification. Cross-lagged
   analyses of two-time data in two independent studies provided support
   for identification generalization from leader identification to
   organizational identification and confirmed the hypothesized mediating
   role of organizational identification. Our results also confirmed the
   moderating role of collective identity orientation and showed that the
   relationship between leader identification and organizational
   identification was stronger for employees with low collective identity
   orientation. Support was also provided for moderated mediation. Overall,
   our findings showcase the importance of examining multiple
   identifications foci when studying social identification at work, and
   provide support for spillover effects of lower-order to higher-order
   identifications.},

Abstract = {Explanations for field change emphasize the role of purposeful strategic
   actors, paying little attention to uncoordinated but cohesive social
   groups, despite their profound impacts on fields ranging from autos and
   news to politics. Using a mixed methods approach, we study Millennials'
   driving behaviours, focusing on the role of generation cohorts as field
   actors. Combining in-depth qualitative analysis with an original
   nationwide survey (N = 2,225) we find that Millennials exhibit
   significantly different driving behaviour than earlier generations,
   driving for roughly 8 per cent fewer trips. These differences are
   primarily due to their attitudes, not, as commonly presumed,
   socio-economic factors. Our results contribute to theory on fields and
   collective actors. First, we identify a new field phenomenon,correlated
   groups, uncoordinated actors behaving as collective agents due to shared
   experiences and characteristics. Second, we identify four mechanisms
   through which correlated groups impact fields:correlated imprinting,
   cohorts as conduit, cohort myth apathy,andcohort myth creation.},

Abstract = {Despite the consensus that information security should become an
   important consideration in information technology (IT) governance rather
   than the sole responsibility of the IT department, important IT
   governance decisions are often made on the basis of fulfilling business
   needs with a minimal amount of attention paid to their implications for
   information security. We study how an important IT governance
   mechanism-the degree of centralized decision making-affects the
   likelihood of cybersecurity breaches. Examining a sample of 504 U.S.
   higher-education institutions over a four-year period, we find that a
   university with centralized IT governance is associated with fewer
   breaches. Interestingly, the effect of centralized IT governance is
   contingent on the heterogeneity of a university's computing environment:
   Universities with more heterogeneous IT infrastructure benefit more from
   centralized IT decision making. In addition, we find the relationship
   between centralized governance and cybersecurity breaches is most
   pronounced in public universities and those with more intensive research
   activities. Collectively, these findings highlight the tradeoff between
   granting autonomy and flexibility in the use of information systems and
   enforcing standardized, organization-wide security protocols.},

Abstract = {The technology readiness (TR) index aims to better understand people's
   propensity to embrace and use cutting-edge technologies. The initial TR
   construct considers four dimensions-innovativeness, optimism,
   insecurity, and discomfort-that collectively explain technology usage.
   The present meta-analysis advances understanding of TR by reexamining
   its dimensionality, and investigating mediating mechanisms and
   moderating influences in the TR-technology usage relationship. Using
   data from 193 independent samples extracted from 163 articles reported
   by 69,263 individuals, we find that TR is best conceptualized as a
   two-dimensional construct differentiating between motivators
   (innovativeness, optimism) and inhibitors (insecurity, discomfort). We
   observe strong indirect effects of these dimensions on technology usage
   through mediators proposed by the quality-value-satisfaction chain and
   technology acceptance model. The results suggest stronger relationships
   for motivators than for inhibitors, but also that these TR dimensions
   exert influence through different mediators. Further, the moderator
   results suggest that the strength of TR-technology usage relationships
   depends on the technology type (hedonic/utilitarian), examined firm
   characteristics (voluntary/mandatory use; firm support), and country
   context (gross domestic product; human development). Finally, customer
   age, education, and experience are related to TR. These findings enhance
   managers' understanding of how TR influences technology usage.},

Abstract = {Almost half of missing women in India are of postreproductive ages. Can
   intrahousehold gender inequality and asymmetry in poverty explain a
   portion of these missing women? Using a natural experiment, I link
   women's intrahousehold bargaining power to their mortality risk. Using a
   structural household model, I estimate the age profile of women's
   bargaining power and construct women's relative poverty rates. I find
   that women's bargaining power declines with age, with older women's
   poverty rates closely matching their mortality rates by age. This
   suggests that many missing women might be accounted for by measuring
   poverty at the individual rather than the household level.},

Abstract = {Do new communication technologies, such as social media, alleviate the
   collective action problem? This paper provides evidence that penetration
   of VK, the dominant Russian online social network, led to more protest
   activity during a wave of protests in Russia in 2011. As a source of
   exogenous variation in network penetration, we use the information on
   the city of origin of the students who studied with the founder of VK,
   controlling for the city of origin of the students who studied at the
   same university several years earlier or later. We find that a 10\%
   increase in VK penetration increased the probability of a protest by
   4.6\% and the number of protesters by 19\%. Additional results suggest
   that social media induced protest activity by reducing the costs of
   coordination rather than by spreading information critical of the
   government. We observe that VK penetration increased pro-governmental
   support, with no evidence of increased polarization. We also find that
   cities with higher fractionalization of network users between VK and
   Facebook experienced fewer protests, and the effect of VK on protests
   exhibits threshold behavior.},

Abstract = {Policy makers have time-inconsistent preferences if they fear losing
   power or are endowed with hyperbolic discount factors. Politicians may
   thus seek to influence future policy choices, for example, by investing
   in green technologies that motivate later politicians to act
   sustainably. I show that optimal investment subsidies are larger for
   technologies that are strategic complements to future investments, that
   are further upstream in the supply chain, or that are characterized by
   longer maturity. Time inconsistency can rationalize subsidies at similar
   levels as market failures such as externalities can. Furthermore, the
   two are superadditive: time inconsistency and strategic investments are
   especially important for long-term policies associated with
   externalities.},

Title = {STRATEGIC LEADERSHIP SYSTEMS: VIEWING TOP MANAGEMENT TEAMS AND BOARDS OF

Journal = {ACADEMY OF MANAGEMENT REVIEW},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {45},
Number = {3},

Abstract = {Top management teams (TMTs) and boards of directors (boards) face
   increasingly turbulent environments as they strategically lead firms
   toward superior firm performance. The dominant theoretical lens about
   these two groups is agency theory, which focuses on the need for
   independence. We suggest that the environment in which the TMT and board
   govern is broader than conceptualized by agency theory, and thus
   theories regarding strategic leadership also require expansion. Drawing
   from the multiteam systems literature and broader systems theory, we
   offer a new consideration of the TMT and board as part of a
   strategic-oriented multiteam system, which we refer to as a strategic
   leadership system. The core premise of our theorizing is that TMTs and
   boards that strongly emphasize attention to both working independently
   and interdependently enhance their group and shared task performance,
   and in turn, firm performance. We further nuance this theorizing by
   describing how external environmental characteristics (i.e.,
   munificence, complexity, dynamism) strengthen or weaken the influence of
   attention to working independently or interdependently, thereby shifting
   the zones of system effectiveness. Based on this theorizing, we offer a
   2 x 2 framework combined with practical recommendations for strategic
   leaders. Additional implications, limitations, and directions for future
   research are discussed.},

Title = {Peer Collaboration as a Relational Practice: Theorizing Affective
   Oscillation in Radical Democratic Organizing},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ETHICS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {164},
Number = {4, SI},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Recently, radical democratic initiatives have been undertaken by
   freelancers and founders who come together in a range of alternative
   forms such as ethical entrepreneurial coalitions, urban coworking
   spaces, and open cooperative networks. In this paper, we argue that
   these initiatives to invent alternative, more equal forms of organizing
   engage strongly with relational activities to replace hierarchical
   interaction with distributed peer collaboration. While the literature
   has emphasized the sense of experimentation and reflexivity of these
   alternative forms of organizing, this paper especially draws attention
   to the affective dynamics of everyday peer-to-peer collaboration.
   Drawing on an 18-month ethnography of a cooperative network of social
   entrepreneurs, we use a practice-based approach to study peer
   collaboration as a relational practice formed through a nexus of
   `weaving,' `sharing,' and `caring' activities. Focusing on the affective
   orders enveloping relational practice, we document how the practice of
   peer collaboration is imbued by what we call an `affective oscillation'
   forming contrasting amplitudes between confidence and frustration,
   exuberance and anxiety, and trust and exhaustion. As our core
   contribution, we problematize how the affirmative intent of radical
   democratic organizing is potentially jeopardized by this `cloudy
   affectivity,' and we conclude that the collective pursuit of embodied
   ethical encounters is formed by slowing down and feeling into affective
   oscillation.},

Title = {How Can Pluralistic Organizations Proceed with Strategic Changer A
   Processual Account of Rhetorical Contestation, Convergence, and Partial

Volume = {31},

Month = {JUL-AUG},
Abstract = {This study examines how pluralistic organizations confronting
   fundamental differences in values can proceed with strategic change. By
   drawing on a longitudinal case analysis of strategic change in a Nordic
   city organization, we show how the proponents and challengers play a
   ``rhetorical game{''} in which they simultaneously promote their own
   value-based interests and ideas and seek ways to enable change. In
   particular, we identify a pattern in which the discussion moved from
   initial contestation through gradual convergence to increasing
   agreement. In addition, we elaborate on four rhetorical practices used
   in this rhetorical game: voicing own arguments, appropriation of others'
   arguments, consensus argumentation, and collective we argumentation. By
   so doing, our study contributes to research on strategic change in
   pluralistic organizations by offering a nuanced account of the use of
   rhetoric when moving from contestation to convergence and partial
   agreement. Furthermore, by detailing specific types of rhetorical
   practices that play a crucial role in strategy making, our study
   advances research on the role of rhetoric in strategy process and
   practice research more generally.},

Abstract = {Using two contemporary cases of the global \#MeToo movement and UK-based
   collective Sisters Uncut, this paper argues that a more in-depth and
   critical concern with gendered difference is necessary for understanding
   radical democratic ethics, one that advances and develops current
   understandings of business ethics. It draws on practices of social
   activism and dissent through the context of Irigaray's later writing on
   democratic politics and Ziarek's analysis of dissensus and democracy
   that proceeds from an emphasis on alterity as the capacity to transform
   nonappropriative self-other relations. Therefore, the aims of the paper
   are: (i) to develop a deeper understanding of a culture of difference
   and to consider sexual difference as central to the development of a
   practical democratic ethics and politics of organizations; (ii) to
   explore two key cases of contemporary feminist social movements that
   demonstrate connected yet contrasting examples of how feminist politics
   develops through an appreciation of embodied, intercorporeal
   differences; and (iii) to extend insights from Irigaray and Ziarek to
   examine ways in which a practical democratic politics proceeding from an
   embodied ethics of difference forms an important advancement to
   theorising the connection between ethics, dissent and democracy.},

Abstract = {Globally, standards govern and organise the production and exchange of
   food. This article uses insights from science and technology studies to
   study the translation of multiple standards in the Ghanaian pineapple
   industry. The data demonstrate a translation process that is best
   described asnesting. Nesting is the process through which producers
   translate multiple standards into a locally contingent network of human
   and non-human actors, which is represented materially by the perfect
   fruit. For nesting to take place, producers develop intra-organisational
   collective practices that we call: prioritising standards, enrolling
   additives, and creating residues. The concept of nesting explains how
   food producers translate multiple standards, while simultaneously
   regaining agency. While nesting enables us to speak about what it means
   to implement the multiple standards that materially embody the
   consumers' vision of perfection, it also contributes to the sociology of
   standards, the literature on standards adoption, and organisation
   studies.},

Abstract = {Research summary Resolving governance disputes is of vital importance
   for communities. Gathering data from GitHub communities, we employ
   hybrid inductive methods to study discussions around initiation and
   change of software licenses-a fundamental and potentially contentious
   governance issue. First, we apply machine learning algorithms
   toidentifyrobust patterns in data: resolution is more likely in larger
   discussion groups and in projects without a license compared to those
   with a license. Second, we analyze textual data toexplainthe causal
   mechanisms underpinning these patterns. The resulting theory highlights
   the group process (reflective agency switches disputes from bargaining
   to problem solving) and group property (preference alignment over
   attributes) that are both necessary for the resolution of governance
   disputes, contributing to the literature on community governance.
   Managerial summary Online communities play an increasingly important
   role in how companies innovate across organizational boundaries and
   attract talent across geographic locations. However, online communities
   are no Utopia; disputes abound even (more) when we collaborate
   virtually. In particular, governance disputes can threaten the
   functioning and existence of online communities. Our study suggests that
   governance disputes in online communities either unfold as bargaining
   over which solution is better or searching for a satisfactory solution.
   The latter is more likely to reach a resolution, when there is common
   ground. Companies interested in leveraging the power of online
   communities should (a) identify or train certain participants to
   transform endless bargaining into collective problem solving and (b)
   foster shared knowledge and value basis among participants through
   recruitment and strong organizational culture.},

Title = {Selling your soul to the devil? The importance of independent ownership
   to identity distinctiveness for oppositional categories},
Journal = {STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT JOURNAL},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {41},
Number = {13},
Pages = {2548-2584},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Research Summary Oppositional categories emerge in direct ideological
   opposition to incumbent mass producers. In doing so, these oppositional
   categories, especially craft-based ones, emphasize their size (small),
   ownership (independence), and production methods (traditional) as
   important identity codes-critical for maintaining their distinctiveness
   from the incumbent category. However, we lack theoretical insights into
   how oppositional category members respond as (former) members defect by
   joining the incumbent category they challenge and ideologically oppose.
   Therefore, taking an identity lens, our study explores the following
   research question:As members sell to incumbents,how do the remaining
   members of the oppositional category attempt to maintain the
   distinctiveness of the collective identity?Our findings reveal
   incumbents' acquisitions of oppositional members open the opportunity to
   elevate the importance of ownership (independence) as a distinctive
   identity code. Managerial Summary Craft categories often emerge by
   opposing large, dominant corporations. This David versus Goliath
   mentality helps establish distinct differences between the two groups of
   firms. However, as owners of the craft organizations grow and sell (to
   the opposition), this can erode the core attributes that originally made
   the craft category distinct. We find that as craft brewers sold their
   breweries to mass producers it did just that-led to considerable
   confusion in what constitutes a ``craft brewery.{''} However, the craft
   brewing collective rallied together to identify ``independence{''} as
   the core feature of craft brewers-one that cannot be bought or copied by
   the opposition-in hopes they can maintain their distinctiveness from
   mass producers.},

Abstract = {Using two national culture dimensions, we show that the influence of
   firms' corporate social performance (CSP) on corporate financial
   performance (CFP) hinges on culture. Specifically, CFP is higher in
   those firms where CSR initiatives are congruent with the cultural
   environment. CSP has a negative impact on CFP for those firms domiciled
   in countries which are individualistic and favor flexibility. These
   findings are amplified for those firms with low levels of foreign
   influence in terms of institutional ownership and sales. Using a dataset
   covering 5334 firms from 41 different countries, our results indicate
   that culture and CSR initiatives have a powerful interaction effect in
   determining CFP, suggesting that CSP's impact is dependent upon the
   culture of the country where the firm resides.},

Journal = {HUMAN RELATIONS},

Volume = {74},
Number = {8},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {The historic turn in organization studies has led to greater
   appreciation of the potential contribution from historical research.
   However, there is increasing emphasis on integrating history into
   organization studies, rather than on recognizing how accommodating
   history might require a reorientation. As a result, key conceptual and
   methodological insights from historiography have been overlooked or at
   times misrepresented. We identify four modes of enquiry that highlight
   distinctions from history about `how to conceptualize' and `how to
   research' the past. First, historical organization studies research the
   past primarily through reference to archival sources. Second,
   retrospective organizational history reconstructs the past principally
   from retrospective accounts, such as those generated in oral history.
   Third, retrospective organizational memory uses ethnography and
   interviews to explore the role of memory in the present. Fourth,
   historical organizational memory traces the institutionalization of
   organizational memory through archival research. From the analysis, we
   argue that historical organization studies are increasingly established,
   and interest in `uses of the past' has contributed to the rise of
   retrospective organizational memory. However, historiographical
   reflexivity - a new concept for organization studies - focuses attention
   on engaging with both history and collective memory, and on the distinct
   methodological choices between archival and retrospective methods.},

Title = {Recycling Infrastructure Development under Extended Producer

Abstract = {To tackle the severe pollution caused by electronic waste (e-waste),
   several developing countries have introduced e-waste legislation based
   on Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR). A major challenge to
   implement EPR in developing countries is the lack of formal recycling
   infrastructure. In this paper, we study if a collective form of EPR
   implementation where producers may jointly invest in recycling
   facilities can promote their incentives to do so. We develop a Nash
   bargaining model that captures the decision dynamics underlying joint
   recycling facility investment. We show that despite its advantage in
   reducing producers' fixed investment costs, joint investment in the
   collective system may lead to a worse recycling infrastructure
   development outcome than independent investment in an individual system.
   This can particularly happen when the collective system involves
   products whose recycling costs are highly differentiated. We further
   show that cost sharing based on the principle of Individual Producer
   Responsibility (IPR) may undermine the recycling infrastructure
   development outcome in the collective system compared to simple
   proportional cost sharing rules. In practice, it is generally believed
   that IPR leads to better design incentives than proportional cost
   sharing rules. Accordingly, our result indicates that there exists a
   tradeoff between these two cost sharing rules, and promoting recycling
   infrastructure development via collective systems may come at the
   expense of design incentives and vice versa.},

Abstract = {Through the lens of boundary theory, we systematically examined cultural
   context as a moderator of relationships between work-family conflict and
   its key theoretical predictors (work/family hours and work/family
   demands) and outcomes (job satisfaction, family satisfaction, and life
   satisfaction). We used 2 different approaches to examine cultural
   variation in the strength of work-family conflict relationships: (a)
   individual cultural values (collectivism, power distance, uncertainty
   avoidance); and (b) regional cluster configurations (e.g., Eastern
   Europe, South Asia). Our meta-analytic investigation is based on data
   drawn from 332 studies (2,733 effect sizes) that represent 58 different
   countries. Consistent with prediction, results revealed that
   collectivism moderated WIF/FIW and satisfaction outcomes such that
   relationships were weaker in more collectivistic contexts than in less
   collectivistic contexts. Little evidence was found to support power
   distance or uncertainty avoidance as individual cultural moderators.
   Findings also indicated that work-family conflict relationships differ
   in strength as a function of regional clusters, lending support to the
   use of configural approaches to examine cross-cultural variation.
   Overall, our findings suggest that domain demands are a robust predictor
   of work-family conflict across countries and that affective correlates
   to work-family conflict meaningfully vary in strength as a function of
   cultural context.},

Abstract = {How do individuals and collectives construct and sustain identities that

   counter-institutional identity as involving individual and collective
   constructions of ``who we are{''} that are in strong opposition to
   dominant values and principles in the field, diverge from roles that are
   established through socialization and training, and involve practices
   that are proudly construed in direct contrast to field norms. We draw on
   findings from a comparative case study of Assertive Community Treatment
   teams to theorize about the identity work of groups and individuals that
   enables and constrains counter-institutional identity constructions. We
   develop a cross-level process model of encapsulation in which
   authoritative texts (or prescriptive documents) play a role in
   sanctioning and enhancing counter-institutional identities. The model
   shows how rigorous positioning against ``who we are not{''} (an
   ``identity foil{''}) through practices of oppositional identity work are
   combined with practices of relational identity work that reinforce
   counter-institutional identities by positively valuing ``who we are{''}
   as superior to the foil. These practices are crucial to understanding
   how and why counter-institutional identities are created and sustained.},

Abstract = {We examine the stock market consequences of disclosing accounting
   irregularities for U.S.-listed foreign firms. After controlling for the
   severity of the irregularity and other firm characteristics, we find
   that foreign firms experience significantly more negative short-window
   stock market reactions following irregularity announcements than do U.S.
   firms. Moreover, for a subsample of 64 irregularities of foreign firms
   that are listed on both a U.S. and home country stock exchange, we find
   evidence that restating firms' U.S. investors react more negatively to
   the same irregularity than their home country investors. This
   differential market reaction appears related to firm-specific
   information risks that are greater for foreign firms than U.S. firms.
   Collectively, consistent with the reputational bonding hypothesis in
   prior literature, our results suggest that accounting irregularities
   cause U.S. investors to reassess the information risk associated with
   foreign firms.},

Journal = {ADMINISTRATIVE SCIENCE QUARTERLY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {65},
Number = {2},
Pages = {434-482},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {When a new industry category is predicated on a product or activity
   subject to ``core{''} stigma-meaning its very nature is stigmatized-the
   actors trying to establish it may struggle to gain the resources they
   need to survive and grow. To explain the process of reducing an industry
   category's stigma, we take an inductive approach to understanding how
   actors in the U.S. medical cannabis industry collectively attempted to
   create and disseminate a moral public image based on healing and
   patients' rights. We find that reducing category-level core stigma is a
   phased effort that takes place across different relational spaces. A
   moral agenda based on broadly acceptable values jumpstarts the process,
   and the industry then creates a new moral prototype reflecting these
   values that industry actors can identify with. Category members must
   publicly disidentify with the current, stigmatized prototypes and infuse
   the new moral prototype among their stakeholder audiences through their
   language and practices, creating emotional connections that lead to
   cognitive acceptance. This process is messy, as individual organizations
   often need to continue engaging in stigmatized behaviors to survive,
   even as they publicly disidentify with them. Our process model also
   identifies ways in which category emergence in core-stigmatized
   categories differs from the process for non-stigmatized categories.},

Abstract = {This paper studies the effects of disclosing the audit engagement
   partner's identity on individual and partnership incentives and overall

   individual engagement partners' preferences with the partnership's
   choice of internal quality control. In our model, disclosure of the
   individual engagement partner (on Form AP) influences the probability
   that clients observe individual partners' past performance. While Form
   AP disclosure increases individual partners' incentives to provide
   high-quality audits for a given level of internal quality control within
   the partnership, it may simultaneously decrease the partnership's
   incentives to maintain good internal quality control systems, leading to
   a net degradation in audit quality. Our paper also demonstrates that the
   level of external audit oversight is critical in determining whether
   Form AP disclosure enhances audit quality.},

Title = {Navigating Embeddedness: Experiences of Indian IT Suppliers and
   Employees in the Netherlands},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ETHICS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {164},
Number = {1},
Pages = {95-113},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {In this article, we shift the usual analytical attention of the GPN
   framework from lead firms to suppliers in the network and from
   production to IT services. Our focus is on how Indian IT suppliers embed
   in the Netherlands along the threefold characterization of societal,
   territorial and network embeddedness. We argue that Indian IT suppliers
   attempt to display societal embeddedness when they move to The
   Netherlands. Our findings reveal that the endeavour by Indian IT
   suppliers to territorially dis-embed from the Dutch context is
   reinforced by their peripheral position in the network and their ability
   to offshore work in a bid to contain costs, in addition to the influence
   of client domination. Therefore, territorial embeddedness is considered
   to be secondary to societal embeddedness which is intertwined with
   client interest while neglecting the interest of other network members.
   Nonetheless, the inter-firm relationship is complex, given the tension
   between societal, territorial and network embeddedness. While preferring
   Indian IT suppliers because of their low pricing, Dutch clients also
   insist on compliance with the institutional context of the Netherlands
   especially when it comes to Dutch employees. This results in
   hybridization which means that Indian IT suppliers find ways to adhere
   to the institutional framework for Dutch nationals while simultaneously
   insulating Indian employees from the same. Consequently, a highly unfair
   segmented internal labour market develops, with Dutch nationals being
   treated more favourably as compared to Indian nationals. Nonetheless, to
   address these violations, Indian employees prefer individual strategies
   of resilience and rework rather than a collectivization response.},

Journal = {ORGANIZATION STUDIES},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {41},
Number = {6},
Pages = {799-820},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {This paper explores the processes through which an organizational story
   acquires mythological status within an organizational field. To this
   end, I analyse a story of a successful case of academic technology
   transfer that gained mythological status in the field of higher
   education in Israel: the commercialization of the innovative
   pharmaceutical drug Copaxone. I identify three concurrent processes of
   mythologizing work: organizational storytelling, media diffusion and
   reconstruction, and field-level retelling and countering. I argue that
   myth-making is a collective work, in which an organizational story is
   shaped not only through the strategic rhetorical work of managers but
   also through interpretations and modifications by the media as well as
   other actors in the field. The myth of Copaxone, as it is currently told
   in the field of higher education in Israel, is a complex assemblage of
   the organizational story and various counter-narratives. I further
   suggest that this myth not only serves to naturalize and reinforce
   academic patenting, but also constitutes a discursive space for
   reflections about the ambiguities inherent in academic
   commercialization.},

   INFORMATION SECURITY EFFECTIVENESS},
Journal = {MIS QUARTERLY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {44},
Number = {2},
Pages = {907-931},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Organizations maintain their desired level of cybersecurity by
   evaluating the information security (ISec) effectiveness of their
   organizational units. Numerous ISec studies have delved into examining
   individual compliance, yet studies that develop an understanding about
   achieving the desired effect of the workgroup ISec have been scarce in
   the literature. Against this backdrop, this research note draws on the
   input-process-output framework to take a multilevel approach and
   examines how an individual security factor ({''}individual
   self-efficacy{''}) and two core workgroup mechanisms ({''}workgroup
   collective efficacy{''} and ``security knowledge coordination{''}) can
   together affect workgroup information security effectiveness (WISE).
   Using a survey, data for the independent variables of the study was
   collected from 68 branch offices (with 536 employees in total) of a law
   enforcement agency in South Korea. Separately, for WISE, we obtained the
   branch offices' annual security assessment scores from the organization.
   The results reveal the cross-level nature of WISE, suggesting that group
   mechanisms significantly mediate the relationship between individual
   self-efficacy and WISE. The results support the view that group
   mechanisms are important in ISec management and need to be considered
   alongside the individual-level analysis in the pursuit of workgroup ISec
   performance. The findings provide insightful implications for both
   theory and practice.},

Title = {Inventing Culinary Heritage through Strategic Historical Ambiguity},
Journal = {ORGANIZATION STUDIES},

Volume = {42},
Number = {2, SI},
Pages = {223-243},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Studies have shown how organisations create and use historical
   narratives to `outpast' competing narratives, in attempts to claim
   authenticity through antiquity. We extend this work by exploring how
   organisations deliberately use historical narratives located in a
   vaguely defined past as a tool to craft legitimate historical narratives
   of a common cultural heritage. We theorise a link between strategic
   ambiguity and historical narratives by explaining how organisational
   actors construct a vaguely defined past and how historical narratives
   help these actors invent a cultural heritage. Conducting an in-depth
   case study of a culinary movement based in Istanbul, Turkey, we identify
   three forms of ambiguity that enable the construction of a common
   cultural heritage. These forms include ambiguity of origin, ambiguity of
   artefacts and ambiguity of ownership, and enable actors to concretise
   and perform a vaguely defined past in the present. Our study advances
   understanding of organisational uses of the past and suggests the term
   `strategic historical ambiguity' to capture how ambiguity is
   deliberately used as a tool to craft legitimate historical narratives of
   a common cultural heritage.},

Abstract = {This paper problematises the ways women's leadership has been understood
   in relation to male leadership rather than on its own terms. Focusing
   specifically on ethical leadership, we challenge and politicise the
   symbolic status of women in leadership by considering the practice of
   New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern. In so doing, we demonstrate
   how leadership ethics based on feminised ideals such as care and empathy
   are problematic in their typecasting of women as being simply the other
   to men. We apply different strategies of mimesis for developing feminist
   leadership ethics that does not derive from the masculine. This offers a
   radical vision for leadership that liberates the feminine and women's
   subjectivities from the masculine order. It also offers a practical
   project for changing women's working lives through relationality,
   intercorporeality, collective agency and ethical openness with the
   desire for fundamental political transformation in the ways in which
   women can lead.},

Abstract = {We study whether the effectiveness of corporate governance mechanisms
   varies depending on the characteristics of the executives subject to
   these mechanisms, namely their ``psychological type,{''} as proxied by
   their history of legal infractions. In particular, we examine insider
   trading, where we can compare the trading behavior of different types of
   executives in the same firm. We find that ``recordholder{''} executives,
   that is, those with prior legal infractions, earn significantly higher
   profits from purchases and sales than nonrecordholder executives.
   Furthermore, the profitability of both purchases and sales is
   significantly increasing in the severity of the infraction. Governance
   mechanisms, such as blackout policies, lower profits of executives with
   only traffic infractions; however, profits for executives with serious
   infractions appear insensitive to blackout policies. Insiders with
   serious infractions are also more likely to trade during blackout
   periods and before large information events and are more likely to
   report their trades to the SEC after the filing deadline. Collectively,
   our evidence suggests that while governance mechanisms can discipline
   executives with minor offenses, they appear largely ineffective for
   those with more serious infractions.},

Title = {How Aggressive Tax Planning Facilitates the Diversion of Corporate
   Resources: Evidence from Path Analysis},
Journal = {CONTEMPORARY ACCOUNTING RESEARCH},

Volume = {37},

Pages = {1882-1913},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {In measuring tunneling with intercorporate loans disclosed by Chinese
   listed companies, we analyze the underlying channels through which
   aggressive tax planning facilitates the diversion of corporate resources
   by firm insiders. Using path analysis, we document that the path from
   tax aggressiveness to related loans is mediated by both the additional
   cash flows from tax savings and the increased financial opacity from tax
   planning, and that additional cash flows plays a much more important
   role than opacity in helping controlling shareholders to divert
   corporate resources under the guise of tax aggressiveness. Beyond the
   two mediated paths, we also detect a residual, direct path from tax
   aggressiveness to related loans. After an exogenous shock from the
   government crackdown on diversionary related loans, we find the direct
   path is fully mediated by the two indirect paths, suggesting that
   tunneling via related loans only occurs at firms where insiders can mask
   tunneling under the cover of opacity or can justify related loans on
   grounds of abnormal cash flows from tax savings. Our evidence supports
   the notion that greater outside scrutiny increases the hurdle for, but
   does not entirely eradicate, diversion facilitated by tax
   aggressiveness. Collectively, our research lends some support to recent
   theory on the importance of taxes to corporate governance by
   demonstrating how the agency costs of tax planning allow certain
   shareholders to benefit from firm activities at the expense of others.},

Title = {Can Employee Stock Options Contribute to Less Risk-Taking?},
Journal = {CONTEMPORARY ACCOUNTING RESEARCH},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {37},
Number = {3},
Pages = {1658-1686},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The executive compensation literature presumes that shareholders offer
   risk-averse managers stock options to entice them to take on more risk,
   resulting in riskier investment decisions and thus a greater return on
   investment. However, recent empirical work challenges this assumption,
   and theoretical research even argues that high levels of option-based
   compensation for generally under-diversified managers may actually lead
   to greater risk aversion. We evaluate the incentive structure of
   employee stock options by examining the level of R\&D investment and the
   return on that investment conditional on the portfolio ``vega,{''} which
   captures the sensitivity of option value to stock price volatility. Our
   results suggest that both investment in R\&D and the return on R\&D, as
   measured by future earnings and patent awards, varies concavely with
   vega. That is, low to moderate levels of vega correspond to increasing
   investment in and returns on R\&D, consistent with vega inducing more
   profitable investments, but marginal returns decline as vega increases.
   Collectively, these results, bolstered by several supplemental analyses,
   suggest that this surprising relation between vega and risky investment
   is driven by greater risk aversion at higher levels of vega. Overall,
   our results imply that employee stock options may not always align the
   incentives of managers and shareholders.},

Abstract = {We examine the role of religious identity in promoting strategic renewal

   firms refers to their collective sense of being that reflects their
   founders' and owner family members' espoused religious values and
   beliefs, thereby distinguishing themselves from others in what is
   central, distinct, and enduring about their organization. We propose
   that such a religious identity determines family firms' spiritual
   capital, which influences strategic renewal activities such as conflict
   resolution and resource allocation. Specifically, we argue that
   spiritual capital can be a double-edged sword when family firms pursue
   strategic renewal. We discuss the implications of our work for future

Title = {To share or not to share: The importance of peer firm similarity to
   auditor choice},
Journal = {ACCOUNTING ORGANIZATIONS AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {83},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {A firm's decision on whether to choose the same auditor as a close
   competitor reflects a trade-off between exercising caution to protect
   its proprietary information and pursuing the benefits of auditor
   knowledge derived from providing services to comparable clients. We
   conduct a survey of audit partners whose responses confirm that clients
   weigh these competing incentives when selecting an external auditor.
   Building on our survey evidence from very experienced practitioners, we
   empirically analyze this phenomenon using archival data. Employing a
   pairwise similarity measure based on descriptions from regulatory
   filings, we find that, on average, peer firms are more likely to engage
   the same auditor when their product offerings are more similar. In
   instances when the focal firm shares the same auditor with more similar
   peer firms, the focal firm benefits from enhanced audit quality while
   also paying lower audit fees. Despite these benefits, we find that peer
   firms are less likely to share auditors with rivals in settings with
   greater perceived costs of information leakage as well as embedded
   auditor-client relationships in which the auditor retains deep client
   knowledge. Collectively, we provide evidence that, although the upside
   stemming from auditor knowledge, on average, dominates the downside of
   greater vulnerability to information leakage, proprietary cost concerns
   motivate firms to deviate from seeking auditor expertise. (C) 2020

   proposes that Klein's emphasis on reparation, while clearly valuable for
   effecting change, can also induce undue guilt that stymies employee
   subjectivity and damages the organization. The term ``reparation
   compulsion{''} is offered to capture this particular dynamic. Defined as
   the incessant drive to atone for guilt, reparation compulsion has both
   individual and collective correlates that together constitute a unique
   and hitherto unexplored organizational pathology. Two vignettes are used
   to demonstrate the limits of reparation in a work setting before turning
   to Menzies' classic case study of a nursing service, which is revisited
   in light of the pitfalls of guilt-driven labor. Together, these
   illustrations revise and expand upon Menzies' concept of social defense,
   placing reparation compulsion at the core of a newfound ``depressive{''}
   social defense system that has direct repercussions for those working in
   the caring professions, and particularly those afflicted with
   ``compassion fatigue.{''} Specifically, the argument is made that
   compassion fatigue is not just an unfortunate side effect of caring, but
   constitutive of an organization in which repairing others requires a
   chronic disrepair of the self. The paper concludes with discussing the
   implications for the psychoanalytic study of organizations.},

Abstract = {This article examines the effects of collective layoff announcements on
   sales and marketing-mix elasticities, accounting for supply-side
   constraints. The authors study 205 announcements in the automotive
   industry using a difference-in-differences model. They find that,
   following collective layoff announcements, layoff firms experience
   adverse changes in sales, advertising elasticity, and price elasticity.
   They explore the moderating role of announcement characteristics on
   these changes and find that collective layoff announcements by domestic
   firms and announcements that do not mention a decline in demand as a
   motive are more likely to be followed by adverse marketing-mix
   elasticity changes. On average, sales for the layoff firm in the layoff
   country are 8.7\% lower following a collective layoff announcement than
   their predicted levels absent the announcement. Similarly, advertising
   elasticity is 9.8\% lower and price elasticity is 19.2\% higher than
   absent the announcement. Conversely, layoff firms typically decrease
   advertising spending in the country where collective layoffs have
   occurred, yet they do not change prices. These findings are relevant to
   marketing managers of firms undergoing collective layoffs and to
   analysts of collective layoff decisions.},

Abstract = {Unit-level dismissal rates have rarely been studied, but utility
   analysis suggests that increasing dismissal rates can improve
   performance by increasing the contribution of a unit's workers. This
   proposition comports with other theory around dismissals but contradicts
   substantial empirical evidence. We extend the staffing utility
   framework, taking a multilevel perspective and attending to both within-
   and between-unit effects of dismissal rate practices. We test our theory
   in monthly observations from 1,047 retail locations over almost 3 years.
   Our results explain how between-unit associations between workforce
   contribution and unit performance can mask the within-unit benefit of
   increasing dismissal rates. This insight reconciles theory with prior
   evidence, although some researchers have interpreted them to be at odds.
   A better understanding of the complex causes and consequences of
   dismissal rates has the potential to open new avenues of research and
   inform practice in ways that promote unit effectiveness.},

Abstract = {Prosocial organizations are emerging to tackle the effects of a New
   Normal. As they navigate its fragile and liquid institutional membranes,
   they prioritize cooperative forms of governance. These forms allow for
   collaboration and democratic decision-making necessary for the
   development of innovative solutions in this new context. At the same
   time, the high coordination costs of cooperatives lead to significant
   market pressures. Therefore, understanding when and under what
   conditions these new cooperatives innovate and strive is important as it
   provides insight into whether and how these ventures can become a viable
   alternative in this changing landscape. Using configurational analyses
   of organizational enablers leading to innovation in 40 entrepreneurial
   cooperatives, we identify three approaches: Attentive Pack, Eclectic
   Troop, and Wandering Herd, showing that innovative outcomes can indeed
   emerge under traditional cooperative features emphasizing collectivism.
   However, the pursuit of higher novelty requires a shift to more
   individualistic, business-as-usual, approaches. The New Normal does
   indeed enhance entrepreneurial activity, but of a different kind
   comprising novel sets of antecedents and outcomes, which we show can
   easily become the new dominant form of venturing required in this new
   context.},

Volume = {163},
Number = {3},
Pages = {451-466},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Secrecy and ethics are often seen as opposing forces within
   organizations. Secret work is viewed as unethical, as it excludes others
   from knowing and is associated with self-interested behavior. We contend
   that this view does not account for the dynamic inherent to secrecy and
   to the fact that ethics is embedded in social relations. This paper
   suggests an alternative view. We consider secrecy as a social process
   which allows employees to maintain their ethics when faced with
   managerial policies that affect the quality of their work. Building on
   an in-depth case study of a team of journalists who worked in secret
   after their managers decided to prioritize the interests of shareholders
   and advertising firms, we show how these journalists managed to maintain
   collective ethics through secrecy and to do their work according to
   their own moral principles. This paper offers two primary contributions.
   First, we show a mutually beneficial relationship between ethics and
   secrecy in organizations, wherein secrecy helps maintaining ethics in
   everyday work. Second, the paper shows how secrecy can lead to ethical
   resistance, via a transformation of the power relationship with
   managers.},

Abstract = {This paper argues that public sector organizational failure may be best
   understood from a perspective of collective denial. The rise of this
   phenomenon is examined using testimony from a Public Inquiry into the
   downfall of a UK hospital, where falling organizational standards led to
   unethical decision making and an unacceptable number of patient deaths.
   In this paper, we show how collective denial, over time, became a
   process that resided within the fabric of organizational life. To
   explore the organizational processes associated with collective denial,
   and how and why it occurs, we identify the influence of a `narrative of
   silence.' This narrative allows ever more serious failings to be
   justified as organizational members lose contact with reality entering a
   downward spiral with no recovery. The combined impact of assumptions
   about leadership capability, enculturated professional identities, and
   organizational loyalty create an environment where a narrative of
   silence can develop.},

Abstract = {Work organizations have long employed various management techniques in
   order to maximize workers' engagement, which in itself implies that
   `alienation' at work is common. One of the central descriptions of
   alienation in classic writings is the idea of not being `at home' while
   at work. In this article, however, we explore its obverse, which we term
   `disalienation' - a relationship to work based on assumptions concerning
   control and agency, aided by collective participatory mechanisms for
   identity construction and dialogical building of social relationships.
   We suggest that the concept and experience can be productively explored
   in the context of organizations which are owned and controlled by
   workers. Using ethnographic case studies from two Polish co-operatives,
   we discuss the potential characteristics of a disalienating relation to
   a work organization and suggest that co-operatives can provide a way for
   workers to be `at home' while they are at work.},

Abstract = {Research summary Focusing on the incubation stage of a potential new
   industry, this article addresses a gap at the intersection of the
   external sourcing and market entry literatures by examining pre-entry
   external sourcing of new resources. Besides drawing on their legacy
   resources, pre-entrants during industry incubation commonly use
   alliances and acquisitions to obtain technical capabilities and
   complementary assets, thereby creating a portfolio of sourcing modes
   that collectively shapes the firms' paths to potential market entry. We
   identify a key pattern at the intersection of type of sourcing mode and
   type of resource: pre-entrants to the incubation stage are more likely
   to use alliances to source technical capabilities, while using
   acquisitions to source specialized complementary assets. Our empirical
   context is the agricultural biotechnology industry.
   Managerial summary Firms typically seek new resources when they begin
   exploring potential industries, before any products have reached the
   market, yet the needed investments face substantial uncertainties. This
   article highlights a pattern in how firms use alliances and acquisitions
   for technical capabilities and complementary resources during the
   incubation stage of the agricultural biotechnology industry. We focus on
   two key features of the external sourcing activity, differing based on
   the type of resource: developing new core technologies, which often
   starts early, tends to leverage external alliance partners; by contrast,
   establishing complementary assets tends to start later through
   acquisitions. The logic underlying these patterns can help managers make
   effective decisions about their external sourcing strategies during the
   incubation stage of a new industry.},

Volume = {66},

Abstract = {We investigate how common institutional investors (CIIs) in supply
   chains affect supplier performance. Social network theory suggests that
   buyer-supplier relationships are influenced by networks of ties in which
   they are embedded. While prior research has concentrated on networks of
   trade interactions, we instead examine the influences of networks
   through common investors. Utilizing a large sample of buyer-supplier
   relationships, we find that the presence of CIIs improves suppliers'
   operating and market performance, especially for suppliers with greater
   dependence on buyers. In addition, supplier performance increases with
   the common ownership stakes held by CIIs, but decreases with the
   asymmetric ownership stakes of CIIs across supply chain partners. We
   find that better financial collaboration between the partners appears to
   be a mechanism through which CIIs enhance supplier performance. Lastly,
   we find that the role of CIIs in strengthening supplier performance is
   distinct from that of direct equity links. Collectively, our findings
   highlight a novel role of indirect cross-ownership in fostering supply
   chain collaboration and coordinating vertical relationships and, in
   turn, improving supplier performance.},

Title = {From proprietary to collective governance: How do platform participation
   strategies evolve?},
Journal = {STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT JOURNAL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {43},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Research Summary When platform leaders change the rules guiding who can
   access and control a platform, the strategies of those who create value
   from the platform can be upended. Little research examines how platform
   participants adapt their strategies when a platform leader changes the
   rules governing access and control. We trace how participation with a
   development platform evolved under four different governance modes with
   varied access and control conditions. Participation intensity increased
   as access opened but decreased when platform leadership became unclear.
   Distributed platform leadership emerged only once the platform was
   collectively governed. Rather than assume that all firm participation
   complements a platform, we show how firms guardedly participate with
   open and collective platforms in ways that can either extend or subvert
   a platform's vitality.
   Managerial Summary As firms consider transitioning proprietary products
   to more open platforms to grow market share and relevance, we suggest
   that managers consider the concerns of external participants when
   designing a system to govern a platform. Opening access to a platform
   alone may be insufficient to stimulate external participants to
   contribute and make real commitments. Our research shows that open
   access did not stimulate external participation when platform leadership
   was not clear. When a structured but collectively determined development
   and governance process was created, external participants increased
   their contributions and even took on project leadership
   roles-distributing leadership of the platform among many firms.},

Title = {The Moral Disillusionment Model of Organizational Transgressions Ethical
   Transgressions Trigger More Negative Reactions from Consumers When

Journal = {JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ETHICS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {172},
Number = {4},
Pages = {653-671},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {We tested whether the impact of an organizational transgression on
   consumer sentiment differs depending on whether the organization is a
   nonprofit. Competing hypotheses were tested: (1) that people expect
   higher ethical standards from a nonprofit than a commercial
   organization, and so having this expectation violated generates a
   harsher response (the moral disillusionment hypothesis) and (2) that a
   nonprofit's reputation as a moral entity buffers it against the negative
   consequences of transgressions (the moral insurance hypothesis). In
   three experiments (collective N = 1372) participants were told that an
   organization had engaged in fraud (Study 1), exploitation of women
   (Study 2), or unethical labor practices (Study 3). Consistent with the
   moral disillusionment hypothesis, decreases in consumer trust
   post-transgression were greater when the organization was described as
   nonprofit (compared to a commercial entity), an effect that was mediated
   by expectancy violations. This drop in trust then flowed through to
   consumer intentions (Study 1) and consumer word of mouth intentions
   (Studies 2 and 3). No support was found for the moral insurance
   hypothesis. Results confirm that nonprofits are penalized more harshly
   than commercial organizations when they breach consumer trust.},

Title = {Location matters: Valuing firm-specific nonmarket risk in the global

Journal = {STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT JOURNAL},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {41},
Number = {7},
Pages = {1210-1244},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Research summary Using collective action and social movement theory, we
   investigate the potential incentives and ability of stakeholders to
   engage in collective action that can increase firm-specific nonmarket
   risk of mining companies. We argue that proximity to the nearest
   environmentally sensitive water source increases the probability that
   local stakeholders will take collective actions that impose material
   costs on the focal mine. We hypothesize that stock markets recognize
   this nonmarket risk and apply a discount on announcements related to
   mines located near such areas, and that these risks are moderated by the
   type of mineral, the nature of the water source, and the strength of
   host country institutions. Using a unique data set and an event study
   method, we find support for most of our arguments.
   Managerial summary We argue that mines located near environmentally
   sensitive water sources are subject to nonmarket risks arising from the
   potential collective actions of local stakeholders and their allies.
   Stakeholder mobilization can impose material costs on a mine in the form
   of delays, regulatory hurdles, and closure. We find that stock markets
   recognize these nonmarket risks and apply a discount on announcements by
   mining companies whose mines are located near environmentally sensitive
   water sources, particularly rivers. However, we also find that investor
   reaction is stronger in countries with strong institutions that support
   collective action. Thus, nonmarket risk management is important even in
   countries that are typically characterized by low political and
   institutional risks. We discuss the degree to which these results can be
   generalized beyond mining.},

Title = {The radical potential of leaks in the shadow accounting project: The
   case of US oil interests in Nigeria},
Journal = {ACCOUNTING ORGANIZATIONS AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {82},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {This paper explores the ways in which leaked documents can be recruited
   to contribute to the counter-hegemonic aims of the shadow accounting
   project. Drawing on material published by Wikileaks as part of
   Cablegate, our case study focuses on private communication between US
   Embassy officials about Chevron Nigeria from 2002 to 2010. In analyzing
   these documents, we mobilize the ideas of both Laclau and Mouffe (1985)
   and Jessop (1990), emphasizing the role discourse plays in the
   production and maintenance of hegemonic coalitions between powerful
   state and market actors, which are central to neoliberalism. Our
   analysis suggests that the sharing of discourse, much of which occurs in
   private, allows a hegemonic coalition to agree to a ``'popular-national'
   programme{''} (Jessop, 1990) that serves the interests of the coalition,
   while masquerading as collectively beneficial. In our case study, this
   private discourse provided the means through which the ``moral and
   intellectual leadership{''} of the coalition could be embedded in a
   shared commitment to the maintenance of oil production in Nigeria,
   despite significant resistance from local communities. In choosing to
   use leaks to explore the state-capital nexus, we offer a shadow account
   of the discursive production of hegemony that reveals it to be an
   ongoing and active project. Importantly, we also show that the very act
   of creating and recreating hegemony through discourse produces moments
   of vulnerability and fragility that present counter-hegemonic
   opportunities. When leaks are mobilized to produce shadow accounts of
   the contradictions and tensions that exist between the state and
   capital, the ``political frontier{''} can be restored in ways that
   re-politicize and radicalize democracy (Mouffe, 2018, p. 4). (C) 2019

Abstract = {In the concluding article, we move from providing a map of the
   collective leadership (CL) research field that has been conducted to
   date to providing a travel guide that we hope can inspire both
   experienced and novice travelers to push out the frontiers of
   exploration of CL. A Rapid Appraisal analysis of the extant CL research
   revealed that most of the work to date has focused on shared and
   distributed leadership; taken an empirical rather than a conceptual
   focus; and strongly emphasized qualitative versus quantitative research
   methods. Looking ahead to future CL research, we identify the following
   three challenges as being the most significant for leadership
   researchers to confront: the fundamental ambiguity of the space in which
   CL resides; the definitional problems inherited from leadership studies
   and exacerbated by its ambiguous nature; and the need to more fully
   embrace issues of process in CL. In response to these challenges, the
   following three guidelines are provided: the need to decipher CL
   configurations and its power-based foundations; the need to establish
   how leadership is made relevant in a collective setting; and the need
   for CL researchers to adopt strong process models.},

   affect workers' power and sense of identity? We rely on an ethnographic
   study of a charitable organization that went through recent
   organizational changes to study two processes constitutive of collective
   forgetting. The first process consists in the past becoming unusable
   because once-useful memories lost their practical usefulness for
   participants' new activities. The second process consists in the past
   becoming uprooted because the social relations through which memories
   used to be shared had changed beyond recognition. Our findings provide
   insights into the organizational processes through which memories cease
   to circulate. They also help understand the complex relations between
   memory, power relations and participants' sense of identity.},

Abstract = {Crowdfunding, a peer-to-peer fundraising mechanism, solicits capital
   from individual backers to support entrepreneurial projects.
   Entrepreneurs set a funding target and deadline; the project will be
   funded only if it reaches this funding target by the deadline. Backers
   individually decide whether to contribute, but their total contributions
   collectively determine whether the project will be successfully funded.
   This study models the dynamics of backers' contributions in the presence
   of success uncertainty and analyzes managerial promotion strategies to
   maximize the likelihood of funding success. Two opposing forces affect
   backer decisions: backers are more likely to back a project that has
   already reached a greater fraction of its funding goal (positive
   externalities), but the backing propensity declines over time (negative
   deadline effects). These two competing forces give rise to a
   time-dependent critical threshold of funding that a project must attain
   to achieve successful funding. We evaluate actionable promotion
   strategies (when to promote the project and how much promotion effort to
   spend) for entrepreneurs to dynamically manage their crowdfunding
   campaigns.},

   socio-cognitive contexts},
Journal = {RESEARCH POLICY},
Year = {2020},

Abstract = {Industries with emerging market categories offer greater opportunities
   for firms to innovate. However, such opportunities are not a matter of
   ``the more, the better.{''} An increasing number of emerging market
   categories poses a dilemma. While more emerging market categories
   arguably bring about increasing growth opportunities, they can also
   generate greater ambiguity for incumbent firms, which may hinder their
   innovation efforts. This study attempts to address this dilemma by
   proposing that the number of emerging market categories in an industry
   will have an inverted U-shaped relationship with incumbent firms'
   innovation efforts. We further argue that this curvilinear relationship
   will be influenced by the socio-cognitive context of a firm's focal
   industry, in the sense that the degree of collective identity
   incoherence at the industry level will intensify the proposed inverted
   U-shaped relationship, whereas the prevalence of trade associations in
   the industry will depress this relationship. We test our hypotheses by
   examining research and development (R\&D) investments of a sample of
   U.S. high-technology manufacturing firms and find support for our main
   prediction and the hypothesized effect of collective identity
   incoherence. We also find a surprising but intriguing moderating effect
   of trade associations.},

Pages = {441-463},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {In this introductory article we explain the impetus for creating the
   Special Issue, along with its goals and the process by which we created
   it. We present a map of the terrain of collective leadership (CL) that
   builds on earlier frameworks, recognizing that the terrain is expanding
   and has become increasingly difficult to traverse. The map is comprised
   of two axes or dimensions. The first axis, the `locus of leadership,'
   captures how scholars conceptualize where to look for manifestations of
   leadership. That is, does the leadership reside in the group or does it
   reside in the system? The second axis is the view of `collectivity' that
   plots how scholars conceptualize the collective. Do they see it as an
   empirical type of leadership or a theoretical lens through which to
   study leadership? We then plot distinctive CL research into four cells,
   providing definitions and references to empirical work emblematic for
   each cell. In introducing and summarizing each of the five articles we
   have selected for this Special Issue, we show where each of these is
   located on the CL research map, and distil how each provides a clear
   connection between theory and method in a way that advances our
   understanding of CL.},

Abstract = {In demographically diverse organizations, employees charged with
   socializing others-socialization agents-must navigate a deep tension
   between the organization's needs to integrate individuals into a
   collective and individuals' needs for recognition of their unique
   identities. Through a qualitative study of employees in an urban charter
   high school where race and class inequalities are salient, we find that
   socialization agents experience this tension as identity threatening. We
   develop a theoretical model of relational reconciliation that traces how
   agents engage with this identity threat in an ongoing, stumbling
   process. Through relational reconciliation, agents come to redefine
   their selves in relation to their ``socializees,{''} which enables them
   to engage in elaborated socialization practices that aim to meet the
   needs of both the organization and the socializee. Our work repositions
   socialization agents as active parties in socialization, explores the
   tensions of socializing members of marginalized groups into a dominant
   culture, and reveals the importance of engaging with one's own
   identities to reconcile these tensions.},

Title = {HOW FORMAL AND INFORMAL HIERARCHIES SHAPE CONFLICT WITHIN COOPERATIVES:
   A FIELD EXPERIMENT IN GHANA},
Journal = {ACADEMY OF MANAGEMENT JOURNAL},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {63},
Number = {2},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {As an organizational form, cooperatives are increasingly being used
   throughout the world across different industries and sectors. While it
   has been suggested that various benefits can be derived from shared
   ownership, cooperatives are often characterized by conflict among
   members that, in turn, can lead to eventual failure of the cooperatives.
   Existing theory has suggested that the choice of formal control
   structure can play an important role in mitigating conflict, but a
   longstanding debate exists as to whether flat versus hierarchical
   control structures are more effective. To add further insight into this
   theoretical discussion, we conducted a field experiment involving 40
   newly formed cooperatives in rural Ghana, which were randomly assigned
   to either a flat or hierarchical control structure. The quantitative
   results of our field experiment and subsequent qualitative data suggest
   that formal hierarchical control structures lead to lower levels of
   collective psychological ownership, which in turn result in higher
   levels of conflict compared to flat control structures within
   cooperatives. However, our results also suggest that the extent to which
   the choice of formal control structures influences conflict among
   cooperative members can be highly dependent on the absence or presence
   of an informal hierarchy.},

Abstract = {How does the legitimacy conferred on entrepreneurial endeavors affect
   the legitimacy of subsequent ones? We extend the notion of a
   ``legitimacy threshold{''} to develop and test a recursive model of
   legitimacy. Whereas extant research has focused on whether
   entrepreneurial endeavors garner sufficient support from key audiences
   to cross this threshold, we argue that the order of magnitude by which
   they succeed or fail is also consequential for later entrants.
   Distinguishing ``blockbuster{''} from ``unsung{''} successes, and ``path
   breaking{''} from ``broken path{''} failures, we contend that recent
   successes and failures affect related subsequent endeavors in
   predictable, though sometimes counterintuitive ways. We test our
   hypotheses by examining 182,358 entrepreneurial endeavors pitched within
   165 categories over a six-year period on Kickstarter, one of the most
   important crowdfunding platforms. We show that individual outcomes,
   taken collectively, generate legitimacy spillovers, either by
   encouraging audiences to repeatedly support other related endeavors or
   by discouraging them from doing so. Our research contributes to
   understanding the recursive nature of legitimacy, the competitive
   dynamics of entrepreneurial efforts, and crowdfunding platforms.},

Journal = {ORGANIZATION STUDIES},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {41},
Number = {4},
Pages = {543-561},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {How can a desire for rebellion drive institutional agency, and how is
   such desire produced? In this paper, we develop a theory of minor
   rebellion as a form of institutional agency. Drawing from the work of
   Deleuze and Guattari as well as from notions of social inquiry and the
   sociology of punk, we qualify and illustrate minor rebellion as a
   lived-in field of desire and engagement that involves deterritorializing
   of practice in the institutional field. Three sets of processes are
   involved: (i) minor world-making, through establishing the aesthetics
   and relations of an outsider social network within a major field,
   including the enactment of cultural frames of revolt and radicalism;
   (ii) minor creating, through constructing and experimenting with terms,
   concepts, and technology that somehow challenge hegemony from within;
   and (iii) minor inquiring, through problematizing social purposes and
   the related experiential surfacing of the desirable new. Minor rebellion
   suggests a new solution to the paradox of embedded agency by describing
   institutional agency as shuttling between political contest and
   open-ended social inquiry, involving anti-sentiments, but also being for
   something. The paper also contributes to recasting institutional agency
   as a process resulting from emergent collective action rather than
   preceding it. To illustrate our theorizing, we describe the emergence of
   Robin Hood Asset Management, a Finnish activist hedge fund. At the end
   of the paper we discuss how minor rebellion raises new questions about
   the multiplicities and eventness of desiring in institutional agency.},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Ideas are connected. New ideas are often seen as creative combinations
   of previous ideas. I study these connections in the context of motion
   pictures. A network of 4,445 movies is constructed to indicate which
   movies are similar. I first examine the properties of the network using
   descriptive and regression analysis; then I develop a model of network
   formation for counterfactual analysis. It is found that most movies
   imitate and evolve around a ``core{''} of the more successful movies. In
   addition, imitation is both conventional and atypical: a new movie
   usually follows a stream of similar movies yet simultaneously combines
   atypical elements from movies outside this stream. This atypicality, if
   well balanced, has a positive effect on the individual movie's box
   office. However, I find that, in the long run, atypical combination may
   lead to a worse collective box-office performance because of the way it
   changes the market structure.},

Abstract = {Studies have examined how managers use strategy tools, but we know much
   less about how managers create strategy tools de novo. We undertook an
   ethnographic study of a business facing a wicked problem and
   investigated the sociomaterial practice of collective toolmaking. We
   identify how strategy toolmaking oscillates between different problem
   domains and reveal how this manifests process affordances, which are
   `unintended' by-products of the toolmaking process. Counterintuitively,
   by intentionally making a strategic tool, actors unintentionally create
   a sociomaterial springboard for `spin-off strategizing' and `the
   discovery of latent ambiguities', generating strategic value beyond the
   tool produced. These insights illuminate how the practice of collective
   toolmaking can stimulate wayfinding, indirectly helping managers to
   respond to wicked problems, characterized by high degrees of complexity,
   ambiguity, and indeterminacy.},

Journal = {CONTEMPORARY ACCOUNTING RESEARCH},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {37},
Number = {2},
Pages = {917-944},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The SEC has long asserted that earnings management practices result in
   adverse consequences for investors. We examine whether SEC oversight
   affects firms' accounting quality in terms of earnings management
   trade-offs. We expect that increased firm-specific regulatory scrutiny,
   in the form of an SEC comment letter, will induce management to switch
   from accrual-based earnings management (AEM), which is a main focus of
   the SEC, to real-activities-based earnings management (REM), which is
   not likely to be commented on in the SEC's review process. Consistent
   with our predictions, we find that AEM is lower and REM is higher
   following the receipt of a comment letter, relative to
   non-comment-letter years and a propensity-score-matched sample of
   non-comment-letter firms. However, we do not find a significant
   difference in total earnings management (i.e., the sum of AEM and REM),
   suggesting that the higher REM acts as a substitute for lower AEM
   activity. We further find that our results are driven by accounting
   comments relating to estimates and accruals and not by
   classification-only comments, which suggests that a comment letter that
   does not question specific issues associated with estimates and accruals
   is not a strong enough signal to induce the firm to change earnings
   management behavior. Additionally, the shift to REM is attenuated for
   firms with high institutional ownership. These results collectively
   suggest that the comment letter process effectively constrains AEM but
   has the unintended consequence of firms, on average, switching to REM.},

Abstract = {By analyzing a large panel of elections in 55 countries, we show that
   political uncertainty surrounding elections can affect asymmetric cost
   responses to activity changes (i.e., cost stickiness). In comparison to
   non-election years, we find that the asymmetry in cost behaviors is
   stronger during election years in regressions that control for other
   firm-level and country-level determinants. In another series of tests,
   we report strong, robust evidence supporting the predictions that the
   importance of political uncertainty to cost stickiness is concentrated
   in countries with sound political and legal institutions. Collectively,
   the results imply that managers retain slack resources when political
   uncertainty is high but to be resolved soon.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS STUDIES},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {51},
Number = {6},
Pages = {933-962},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {The authors meta-analyze relationships of perceived organizational
   support (POS) with attitudinal and behavioral outcomes in Western (i.e.,
   horizontal-individualistic) and Eastern (i.e., vertical-collectivistic)
   cultures. The social-exchange perspective suggests that POS effects are
   stronger in Western cultures because employees are more likely to see
   the self as independent and understand their relationship with the
   organization in terms of reciprocity. However, the social-identity
   perspective suggests that POS effects are stronger in Eastern cultures
   because employees are more likely to see the self as interdependent and
   are more attuned to organizational support as an identity-related cue.
   Addressing these competing hypotheses, meta-analytic results from 827
   independent samples (n = 332,277) across 54 countries show support for
   both perspectives. In the West, POS was more strongly associated with
   social-exchange processes than organizational-identification processes.
   In contrast, In the East, POS was more strongly associated with
   organizational-identification processes than social-exchange processes.
   Overall, POS was more strongly related to job attitudes and performance
   in the East than in the West. Cultural differences in POS effects on
   attitudinal outcomes were found to be increasing over time. We discuss
   the implications of these findings for organizational-support theory and
   research.},

Title = {How the Show Goes On: Using the Aesthetic Experience of Collective
   Performance to Adapt while Coordinating},
Journal = {ADMINISTRATIVE SCIENCE QUARTERLY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {66},
Number = {1},
Pages = {1-41},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Coordinating in action groups consists of continuously adapting
   behaviors in response to fluctuating conditions, ideally with limited
   disruption to a group's collective performance. Through an 18-month
   ethnography of how members of a community choir maintained beautiful,
   ongoing performance, I explored how they continuously adapted their
   coordinating, starting when they felt that their collective performance
   was fragmented or falling apart. The process model I developed shows
   that this aesthetic experience-the sense of fragmentation based on
   inputs from the bodily senses-leads to emotional triggering, meaning
   group members' emotions prompt changes in their attention and behavior.
   They then distribute their attention in new ways, increasing their focus
   on both global qualities of their ongoing performance (in this context,
   the musical score and conductor) and local qualities (singers'
   contributions). My findings suggest that by changing what aspects of a
   situation compose their immediate experience, action group members can
   adapt their coordinating behaviors by changing their heed: the behavior
   that demonstrates their attentiveness and awareness. The intertwining of
   attention and emotions helps explain how groups move between heedless
   and heedful interrelating over time, leading to an aesthetic experience
   of collective performance as being whole or coherent. My research shows
   that embodied forms of cognition (what we know from direct experience of
   an environment) complement accounts of how representational forms of
   knowledge (what we know from symbols, concepts, or ideas) facilitate
   real-time adaptation in groups. These insights have implications for a
   range of organizations engaged in complex action group work.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS STUDIES},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {52},

Pages = {78-104},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Expatriate host country language proficiency is predominately assumed to
   have a negative linear relationship with expatriate social
   categorization - as outgroup members - by host country national (HCN)
   employees in foreign subsidiaries. Departing from this assumption, we
   use social identity theory (SIT) and SIT-based sociolinguistics to
   hypothesize that expatriate host country language proficiency, due to
   identity threat, has a curvilinear U-shaped relationship with HCNs'
   expatriate outgroup categorization: at first, outgroup categorization
   decreases with increasing expatriates' language proficiency, but, from a
   certain point onwards, it increases because ``too good{''} language
   proficiency violates salient intergroup boundaries between HCNs and
   expatriates. Due to their key roles in social categorization, we also
   examine whether HCN allocentrism and uncertainty avoidance moderate the
   proposed curvilinear relationship. Results from data collected from 1166
   HCN employees in 956 foreign subsidiaries in Japan provide support for
   the main curvilinear relationship and the moderating curvilinear
   relationship of uncertainty avoidance. Our results suggest that the
   language-proficient expatriate social categorization relationship is
   more complex than previous international business research has evoked.
   Our study contributes to the international business literature by
   casting doubt on the widely held assumption that expatriate adaptation
   towards the host country always carries beneficial effects. Our study
   cautions, in particular, against the common assumption that higher
   proficiency in the host country language will automatically lead to
   better relationships with HCNs in foreign subsidiaries.},

Title = {Nation-dyadic history and cross-border corporate deals: Role of
   conflict, trade, generational distance, and professional education},
Journal = {STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT JOURNAL},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {41},
Number = {3},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Research Summary This paper explores why and how nation-dyadic history
   impacts aggregated firm decisions involving cross-border activities
   (acquisitions, joint ventures, and alliances). We contextualize history
   and illustrate the negative effect of historical conflict on
   cross-border deals. Nation-dyads with historical conflict incorporate
   negative sentiments into their social and collective memories and
   national identities. Members of society assume the socially constructed
   national identity via primary and secondary socialization. National
   identities incorporate sentiments towards other nations and condition
   individuals' preferences, culminating in a preference-biased search for
   or preference-supporting evaluation of information concerning
   cross-border deals. An increased generational distance from prior
   conflict and a higher percentage of graduates with common professional
   identities constructed by higher education in the social sciences, law,
   and business dampen the negative influence of historical conflict.
   Managerial Summary There is a reciprocal relationship between
   international trade and conflict across two nations: as the potential
   for conflict increases, trade levels fall, and as trade levels increase,
   the potential for conflict rises. We disentangle this relationship and
   determine the implications of historical conflict between two nations
   for cross-border corporate deals (i.e., acquisitions/joint
   ventures/alliances). We show that, controlling for other factors, more
   frequent historical conflict discourages cross-border corporate deals.
   We see this finding as a result of biased decision making based on
   preferences which reflect sentiments formed by national identities. Two
   mechanisms dampen the negative relationship between binational conflict
   and cross-border deals: a higher percentage of business/law/social
   sciences graduates and a higher number of generations passed since the
   last conflict.},

Abstract = {Referring to the phenomenon of structural injustice resulting from
   unintended consequences of the combination of the actions of many
   people, Iris Marion Young claims for a new understanding of
   responsibility. She proposes what she calls a social connection model of
   responsibility which assigns responsibility to individuals also for
   participating in ongoing structural and social processes. To remedy
   structural injustice Young claims for collective action of various
   actors in society and assigns different degrees of responsibility
   depending on the agent's position within the structural process.
   However, although Young mentions power, privilege, interest, and
   collective ability as parameters influencing the degree of an actor's
   responsibility to contribute to structural change she does not elaborate
   which responsibilities concern which groups in society. As we will
   outline in our contribution, we hold the tenet of subsidiarity to be a
   useful supplement to the conception of Iris Marion Young which would
   allow for assigning such responsibilities to different layers in
   society. However, since the tenet of subsidiarity is only a supple
   principle which does not distinguish between different kinds of duties,
   we propose to enrich the tenet of subsidiarity by the Kantian conception
   of perfect and imperfect duties.},

Abstract = {We consider social welfare functions that satisfy Arrow's classic axioms

   the outcome space is the convex hull of some finite set of alternatives.
   Individual and collective preferences are assumed to be continuous and
   convex, which guarantees the existence of maximal elements and the
   consistency of choice functions that return these elements, even without
   insisting on transitivity. We provide characterizations of both the
   domains of preferences and the social welfare functions that allow for
   anonymous Arrovian aggregation. The domains admit arbitrary preferences
   over alternatives, which completely determine an agent's preferences
   over all mixed outcomes. On these domains, Arrow's impossibility turns
   into a complete characterization of a unique social welfare function,
   which can be readily applied in settings involving divisible resources

Title = {Bellwether and the herd? Unpacking the u-shaped relationship between
   prior funding and subsequent contributions in reward-based crowdfunding},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BUSINESS VENTURING},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {35},
Number = {2},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Building on the insights from observational learning and other social
   influence research, this study challenges the existing literature that
   proposes a linear relationship between prior funding and subsequent
   contributions in the crowdfunding setting. Instead, we propose a
   U-shaped relationship, illustrating a negative relationship between
   prior funding and subsequent contributions when funding amounts are
   small and this relationship becomes positive when prior funding amounts
   are large. Consistent with the rational herding perspective, we assume
   that individuals do not mindlessly mimic one others' behaviors, but
   incorporate quality signals into their decision-making. Signals
   indicating a high quality project such as video quality, as well as the
   preparedness and passion of the entrepreneur enhance this U-shaped
   relationship whereas indicators of situational urgency weaken this
   relationship. Based on a sample of 11,019 daily observations of 333
   Kickstarter projects, we find general support for our hypotheses. Our
   post hoc experiment further supports the mechanisms underlying the
   U-shaped relationship. This paper extends our understanding of the
   relationship between past actions and subsequent behavior, and
   contributes to the literatures of observational learning, crowdfunding,
   and visual information.
   Executive summary: We challenge the extant literature that has proposed,
   but inconsistently documented, a positive effect of prior funding on
   subsequent crowdfunding contributions. We argue that such inconsistency
   is due to the lack of integration of insights from other social
   influence research, such as observational learning, threshold models,
   and bystander effects. This research has been limited when postulating
   that crowdfunding backers simply imitate others' actions in order to
   mitigate uncertainty producing a linear effect, yet such an effect
   depends on the intensity of others' actions and may be curvilinear. This
   research overlooks the fact that backers do not merely passively imitate
   others' behaviors, but incorporate quality signals sent by entrepreneurs
   to make such decisions. Thus, it is important to account for potential
   moderators that may influence the complex relationship between prior
   funding and subsequent contributions.
   Based on observational learning research and related models, accrued
   prior funding may be perceived differently by potential backers:
   individuals may view accrued funding as a sign of a decreased funding
   need on the part of a campaign's creators, because others are already
   backing the campaign or, alternatively, they may see it as a cue of high
   product quality. These conflicting effects may lead to a U-shaped
   relationship between prior funding and subsequent contributions at a
   collective level. At low funding levels, prior funding may be negatively
   associated with subsequent contributions because such levels indicate
   there is already support, but that the campaign may not be of high
   quality. At medium levels, prior funding may have no effect on
   contributions, aside from halfhearted interest of other backers. At high
   levels, prior funding may be positively related to subsequent
   contributions as this sends a robust cue of project quality and
   convinces prospective donors to contribute. Further, we derive a
   U-shaped relationship which may be moderated by visual media-based
   quality signals and situational urgency.
   To test these hypotheses, we conducted two studies. One was a field
   study of 333 Kickstarter projects, with 11,019 daily observations of
   crowdfunding activities from mid-February 2013 through mid-April 2013.
   We used the Kicktraq website to track Kickstarter projects and recruited
   390 participants via Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) to evaluate the
   video pitches on Kickstarter. Our results suggest a negative
   relationship between prior funding and subsequent contributions when
   funding amounts are small. This relationship becomes positive when prior
   funding amounts are large. Thus, we find a U-shaped relationship between
   prior funding and subsequent contributions, with an inflection point
   when prior funding amounts reach between 72\% and 80\% of the funding
   goal. This is strengthened in the presence of visual media-based quality
   signals, such as video quality, as well as the preparedness and passion
   of the entrepreneur. However, indicators of situational urgency may
   weaken this U-shaped relationship.
   We followed up with a post hoc experiment to document the two mechanisms
   by which prior funding influence subsequent contributions. We found that
   increases in the prior funding amount increased perceived product
   quality but decreased perceived urgency. These perceptions were found to
   jointly influence participants' proposed pledged amounts, supporting an
   explanation of a complex relationship between prior funding and
   subsequent contributions.
   This study is among the first to offer a more complete picture of the
   relationship between past actions and subsequent behavior under market
   and institutional constraints (i.e., when market actors observe the
   censored behaviors of other actors on crowdfunding platforms) and
   contributes to the literatures of observational learning, crowdfunding,
   and visual information.},

Abstract = {Are there benefits to seeking feedback from peers, or is it not worth
   the time and effort as employees sometimes believe? If there are
   benefits, does it matter in teams both with and without formal
   supervisors, and what contextual conditions facilitate such seeking?
   These questions motivate the current research. Based on the theoretical
   differences between peers and supervisors as targets of feedback
   seeking, we adopt a cost-value perspective to examine whether task
   interdependence and psychological safety affect the seeking of feedback
   from peers in a team. We also assess whether such seeking creates value
   for the seeker him-/herself (by having a cross-source effect on the
   supervisor's evaluations) and for the collective (by impacting the
   team's creativity). We test these ideas in two studies. In a sample of
   209 employee-supervisor dyads (Study 1), we find that employees seek
   more peer feedback when tasks are interdependent, especially when they
   perceive their working environment as psychologically safe, and that
   supervisors view employees who seek more peer feedback as better team
   contributors. Then, in a longitudinal sample of 88 self-managed MBA
   consulting teams (Study 2), we find that the average level of peer
   feedback seeking in a team enhances the team's creativity. Our findings
   highlight the power of seeking feedback from peers as well as the
   context factors shaping it.},

Abstract = {Building on motivation crowding theory (MCT), this article contributes
   to the human resources management (HRM)-innovation debate by examining
   the potential trade-offs between HRM practices targeted to increase
   employees' intrinsic motivation, such as direct employee voice (EV), and
   the presence of extrinsic incentives in the form of individual and
   collective performance-related pay (PRP). The results of the analysis on
   more than 22,000 European establishments show support for the positive
   relationship between EV and a firm's organizational innovation, and that
   this relationship is weaker in companies that adopted individual PRP
   schemes (piece-rate plans). Moreover, while we found that collective PRP
   (profit-sharing) does not moderate the relationship between EV and
   organizational innovation, a positive and significant moderation effect
   emerged when the combined presence of individual and collective PRP was
   considered. By advocating that the coexistence of multiple forms of PRP
   could overcome the crowding-out effect of individual PRP on EV, the
   study contributes to the HRM debate by also calling for a better
   understanding of the potential contingencies between different HRM
   practices when innovation is focus of the analysis.},

Abstract = {We argue that collective engagement can serve as a unique value-creation
   capacity at the business level by linking shared vision and service
   performance. We also propose that competitive intensity will be a market
   indicator by which management can enhance the effect of shared vision on
   collective engagement, and indirectly strengthen service performance
   (through collective engagement). Furthermore, we argue that this
   distinctive value-creation capability, embedded in collective
   engagement, generates competitive advantage; specifically, one that
   competing organizations will struggle to replicate. We examine our
   moderated-mediation model by using a three-time-point method derived
   from five different sources in 198 retail-service branches. Our findings
   indicate that collective engagement, fueled by shared organizational
   vision, improves service performance. Furthermore, as this conditional
   indirect effect of shared vision on service quality and customer
   satisfaction was solely generated through collective engagement rather
   than other mechanisms (i.e., commitment and involvement), it creates a
   competitive advantage for engagement-oriented organizations.},

Title = {Different expectations: A comparative history of structure, experience,

Journal = {STRATEGIC ENTREPRENEURSHIP JOURNAL},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {14},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Research Summary This comparative historical analysis demonstrates how
   memory and reflexive interpretations of the past can shape
   entrepreneurial willingness to collaborate with larger firms in an
   industry. Emphasizing the importance of spatial metaphors and
   periodization for developing historical knowledge, the paper focuses on
   how the historical space of experience explains how entrepreneurs make
   strategic choices regarding collaboration under conditions of complexity
   and uncertainty. Comparing the U.S. and U.K. emerging poultry sectors
   offers a methodologically novel analysis of an important but
   little-studied agribusiness sector, offering a dual reading that
   compares two versions of historical reasoning both theoretically and
   empirically.
   Managerial Summary Historical experience matters to entrepreneurs,
   shaping their expectations about markets and opportunities, including
   possibilities for strategic alliances with larger firms. Rather than
   assuming that the events of the past structurally determine
   entrepreneurial expectations for the future, we demonstrate how
   experience, interpretation, and memory shape the nature of competition
   and collaboration in emerging industries. Our approach relies on the
   comparative method, suggesting a new way to consider how uses of the
   past might shape entrepreneurship in industries other than the U.S. and
   U.K. poultry industries that serve as our empirical focus.},

Abstract = {Little consensus exists about the effectiveness of transnational private
   governance in domains such as labor, the environment, or human rights.
   The paper builds on recent scholarship on labor standards to emphasize
   the role of labor agency in transnational private governance. It argues
   that the relationship between transnational private regulatory
   initiatives and labor agency depends on three competences: first, the
   ability of workers' organizations to gain access to processes of
   employment regulation, implementation, and monitoring; second, their
   ability to insist on the inclusion of employers and state agencies
   within such processes; and third, the ability of workers to effectively
   exercise leverage in pursuit of particular goals. The paper develops a
   framework, called hybrid production regime, for examining how workers'
   capacity to act at the local level depends on how these three collective
   competences are addressed in the institutionalization of capital-labor
   relations between the transnational and national levels.},

Journal = {CONTEMPORARY ACCOUNTING RESEARCH},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {37},
Number = {1},
Pages = {245-276},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Auditors frequently use valuation specialists to help them evaluate fair
   values, but researchers and regulators know little about how auditors
   use these specialists. Based on interviews with 28 auditors and 14
   valuation specialists, I develop a theoretical framework informed by
   expert systems and professional competition theories. The interviews
   suggest that institutional pressures in the fair value environment
   unevenly impact auditors and specialists, causing tension between
   auditors' needs for ontological security and jurisdictional claims. This
   tension leads to one-sided competition between auditors and specialists
   and incomplete acceptance of specialists' work. Auditors' competitive
   behaviors coupled with this incomplete acceptance result in a tendency
   to make specialists' work conform to auditors' views. Collectively,
   these findings suggest that auditors use specialists as an institutional
   mechanism to create comfort, but not insight. This study links expert
   systems and professional competition theories, and it provides critical
   insight into some assumptions underlying tenets of each theory. It also
   informs researchers, regulators, and practitioners interested in
   understanding and addressing problems related to the use of specialists.},

Abstract = {When organizations face paradoxical tensions, such as when they must
   simultaneously meet scientific and commercial objectives, individuals
   within the organization also experience tensions. How individuals'
   responses to these tensions inform the collective organizational
   response remains a theoretical and empirical challenge. We address this
   challenge by introducing a social network perspective. In a two-stage
   mixed-method study of a research institute in Taiwan, we examined how
   individuals' social networks facilitated the organization's response to
   a science-commerce paradox. Our results demonstrated that the level of
   heterogeneity in each individual's social network influenced how each
   individual contributed to the organization's collective response.
   Specifically, individuals with heterogeneous instrumental networks were
   more likely to contribute to the organization-wide consensus response,
   whereas individuals with homogeneous expressive networks were more
   likely to contribute to a polarized subgroup response. Our findings
   suggest that individuals' roles in shaping a collective organizational
   response to paradoxes depends on who they seek advice from and who they
   befriend.},

Title = {Weaving network theory into effectuation: A multi-level
   reconceptualization of effectual dynamics},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BUSINESS VENTURING},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {35},
Number = {2},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {This paper positions effectuation as a network-driving and network
   dependent phenomenon and suggests that understanding networks and
   network processes is essential to understanding the dynamics of
   effectuation. We argue that the implementation of effectuation is
   influenced by the nodal, relational, and structural characteristics of
   pre-existing and emerging networks, and by the processes through which
   these networks come about. We use these arguments to develop a
   multilevel, multi-theoretical reconceptualization of effectuation that
   provides for distributed agency and collective cognition of network
   members. We allow for the simultaneous and interactional use of
   effectual and causal logics, as well as the co-construction of
   knowledge, identity, and social capital within and across network
   levels. Our model also addresses changing uncertainty as opportunities
   develop, nuances of effectual interactions, and evolving market
   dynamics. Our propositions and reflections offer directions for further
   studies at the intersection of network and effectuation research.
   Executive summary: There is little doubt that effectuation is reshaping
   how we think about entrepreneurial cognition and behavior. A core
   argument is that under conditions of uncertainty, entrepreneurs can
   co-create opportunities by collaborating with other willful agents. This
   moves us away from classical views of entrepreneurship and positions
   effectuation as a network-driving and network-dependent phenomenon. Yet,
   recent debate highlights that effectuation research has paid
   insufficient attention to the network of external parties involved. As a
   result, although the extant model of effectuation recognizes the
   importance of networks, our understanding of the relationship between
   effectual logic and entrepreneurial networks is far from complete.
   Several theoretically important and practically relevant questions arise
   from this knowledge gap. For example if we think about network
   development, how are potential stakeholders brought to mind and
   persuaded to commit if end-points and stakeholder preferences are both
   unknowable? What are the characteristics (i.e. structure, content and
   governance) of the networks that emerge through these commitments?
   Reciprocally, how do the characteristics of the emerging network
   influence effectual processes and outcomes?
   In this paper, we begin to address this line of questioning by
   considering effectuation not only at the level of the individual but
   also through lenses reflective of the three levels of analysis commonly
   adopted in network research: i) dyadic relationships, ii) the
   entrepreneurial network, and iii) the market more generally. While we
   attend to pre-existing networks (the constitution of which is likely to
   affect the probability of adopting effectual logic), our focus is on
   linking the individual and emerging networks across these levels.
   At the level of the individual, we break from prior effectuation
   research and ascribe new and influential roles to entrepreneurial ideas
   and instrumental mindsets in focusing an entrepreneur's attention on
   particular relationships (i.e. the cognitive activation of a cohesive
   network involving interested and persuadable individuals). At the level
   of the dyad, we suggest the very nature of interactions between actors
   can influence individual choice of logic. We specify that stakeholders
   will expect signs of process legitimacy (e.g. cognitive flexibility on
   the part of the entrepreneur) before making effectual commitments. We
   also move away from assumptions about altruistic behavior to suggest
   that power and influence will accrue to stakeholders whose resources are
   at risk and/or perceived by others to resolve uncertainty. At the level
   of the entrepreneurial network, we link effectuation to a brokerage
   orientation (tertius iungens) that enhances inclusiveness surrounding
   means and collective cognition. Moreover, we move beyond the narrow view
   of facilitating and constraining factors portrayed in the effectuation
   literature to argue that (e.g.) i) with respect to network content,
   resource specificity will shape possible futures; ii) with respect to
   governance, trust, supported by social mechanisms will predominate; and,
   iii) with respect to structure, specific network characteristics will be
   more supportive of certain aspects of effectuation than others (e.g.
   cohesive networks are more supportive of collaboration, but may limit
   the flexibility needed to embrace contingencies). At the market level,
   we posit that on the one hand, institutions will shape effectual
   processes. On the other hand, effectual processes are more likely than
   causal processes to create new institutions and/or supplant existing
   institutions.
   Overall, our study contributes to the understanding of both effectuation
   and networks by offering a multi-level, multi-theoretical
   re-conceptualization of the dynamics of effectuation. Our arguments
   should spur research in at least three interdependent areas: i)
   uncertainty and individual cognition; ii) network processes surrounding
   interactions and commitments; and iii) the contingent effects of network
   characteristics on effectuation. For practitioners, our insights should
   help shape thoughts about i) who to interact with in the face of
   uncertainty; ii) what stories to tell and how to deal with image
   management; iii) what to expect during negotiations; iv) how to broker
   relationships to enhance the `co' in `co-creation'; and moreover, v)
   what network characteristics might facilitate or constrain their
   efforts.},

Volume = {66},
Number = {3},

Abstract = {The underrepresentation of minorities in cultural industries is a widely
   publicized problem with far-reaching economic and social significance.
   It is also one of many industries in which employers suggest that the
   locus of bias is not within the organization but with the consumer. The
   empirical challenge of relating consumer behavior to employee
   composition has constrained prior efforts to test their claim and to
   test the theory of consumer discrimination more broadly. As a result,
   employers have gradually expanded the scope of the customer
   discrimination theory from one rooted in direct interaction to include
   an aversion to simply seeing employees of a different ethnicity. We
   explore how consumers respond to employee composition by evaluating the
   performance of films released in the United States as a function of the
   racial diversity of their cast. We find that films with a single black
   actor do not differ from those with zero black actors, and that films
   with multiple black actors in the principal cast actually achieve
   significantly higher domestic box-office revenues than either. To
   distinguish between competing explanations for this result, we conduct a
   vignette-based experiment that allows us to identify a positive
   influence of diversity on consumers' assessments of quality, controlling
   for differences in film or actor appeal. Collectively, these results
   help discredit one rationale for unequal hiring in cultural industries
   and also suggest an important qualification to the theory of consumer
   discrimination: in settings where employee race is visible but the
   consumer is physically distant, diversity is more profitable than
   costly.},

Abstract = {Leader exits at the work-unit level are prevalent, yet little attention
   has been devoted to understanding the impact of leader succession on
   employee turnover. In this paper, we draw from uncertainty-management
   theory to specify and test conditions under which leader exits are
   followed by increases (or decreases) in the turnover rates of remaining
   members. We theorize that leader exits disrupt the status quo and
   heighten remaining members' feelings of uncertainty and propose that
   characteristics of the outgoing and incoming leaders help members
   forecast their future work situation and influence their decisions to
   stay or leave. Leveraging longitudinal data from 287 locations of a U.S.
   hospitality organization (n = 6,357 unit-month observations), we test
   several attributes of the succession context that moderate the effects
   of leader departures on both the initial change in turnover levels and
   the longer-term change in turnover trends. Discontinuous growth models
   revealed both an initial spike and a longer-term rise in voluntary
   turnover rates following the departure of a high-performing leader. In
   addition, the longer-term turnover trajectory was found to trend upward
   when replacements lacked role experience, when replacements were
   internally promoted, and when post-succession involuntary termination
   rates were high. Overall, we conclude that the magnitude and direction
   of leader-succession effects on unit turnover rates depends on
   uncertainty-reducing characteristics associated with both outgoing and
   incoming leaders.},

Abstract = {Video sharing social media platforms, such as YouTube, offer an
   effective way to deliver medical information. Few studies have
   identified evidence-backed digital therapeutics with technology-enabled
   interventions to improve the ease with which patients can retrieve
   medical information to manage chronic conditions. We propose an
   interdisciplinary lens that synthesizes deep learning methods with
   themes emphasized in Information Systems and Healthcare Informatics
   research to examine user engagement with encoded medical information in
   YouTube videos. We first use a bidirectional long short-term memory
   method to identify medical terms in videos and then classify videos
   based on whether they encode a high or low degree of medical
   information. We then employ principal component analysis on aggregate
   video data to discover three dimensions of collective engagement with
   videos: nonengagement, selective attention-driven engagement, and
   sustained attention-driven engagement. Videos with low medical
   information result in nonengagement; at the same time, videos with a
   greater amount of encoded medical information struggle to maintain
   sustained attention-driven engagement. Our study provides healthcare
   practitioners and policymakers with a nuanced understanding of how users
   engage with medical information in video format. Our research also
   contributes to enhancing current public health practices by promoting
   normative guidelines for educational video content enabling management
   of chronic conditions.},

Abstract = {The current study examines the micro-linguistic details of Twitter
   responses to the whistleblower-initiated publication of the Panama
   Papers. The leaked documents contained the micro-details of tax
   avoidance, tax evasion, and wealth accumulation schemes used by business
   elites, politicians, and government bureaucrats. The public release of
   the documents on April 4, 2016 resulted in a groundswell of Twitter and
   other social media activity throughout the world, including 161,036
   Spanish-language tweets in the subsequent 5-month period. The findings
   illustrate that the responses were polyvocal, consisting a collection of
   overlapping speech genres with varied thematic topics and linguistic
   styles, as well as differing degrees of calls for action and varying
   amounts of illocutionary force. The analysis also illustrates that,
   while the illocutionary force of tweets is somewhat associated with the
   adoption of a prosaic and vernacular ethical stance as well as with
   demands for action, these types of voicing behaviors were not present in
   the majority of the tweets. These results suggest that, while social
   media platforms are a popular site for collective forms of voicing
   activities, it is less certain that these collective stakeholder voices
   necessarily result in forceful accountability demands that spill out of
   the communication medium and thus serve as an impulse for positive
   social change.},

Abstract = {This study examines the phenomenon of `liberating leadership', an
   emerging trend promising self-mastery and collective unity, resonating
   with the literature on post-heroic leadership. We evaluate the claims of
   liberating leadership from a psychodynamic perspective, using a Lacanian
   approach. We examine how post-heroic forms of leadership reconfigure
   symbolic and imaginary aspects of follower identification, with
   ambivalent effects. Drawing empirically on the case of a Belgian banking
   department, we trace how a `liberating' leader was able to garner
   intense psychological attachment among followers, accompanied by the
   `dark sides' of personal exhaustion and breakdown, normative pressure to
   be overly happy, and the scapegoating of contrarian managers
   representing symbolic prohibition.},

Abstract = {Work-family practice research has largely been focused on individual
   outcomes, despite their theorized importance for organizational
   performance. Additionally, studies of the effectiveness of work-family
   practices are dominated by cross-sectional designs that are unable to
   rule out additional causal arguments for observed relationships.
   Finally, childcare initiatives that help employees better address family
   demands have received little research attention relative to other
   work-family practices, and these studies have produced mixed results.
   Grounded in context-emergent turnover theory, the present study assesses
   the relationship between establishment childcare initiatives and
   collective turnover rates of men and women in 24,888 observations of
   German establishments between 2002 and 2012. Findings indicate childcare
   initiatives are associated with lower female collective turnover rates
   in following years and that higher female collective turnover rates are
   also associated with a higher likelihood of adopting a childcare
   initiative in subsequent years. These results provide support for the
   argument that childcare initiatives can improve collective turnover
   rates of women and are not adopted only by already-high-performing
   organizations.},

Abstract = {We advance interactionist perspectives on how organizational structures
   emerge in new issue domains. Our study is grounded in field data
   collected over 18 months at a large biomedical company that sought to
   become more sustainable. Over that period, some sustainability-related
   issues became firmly embedded in formal structures and procedures, while
   others faltered. We identify the quality of situational interactions
   among organizational members as the engine behind the structuring of
   organizational sustainability efforts. Successful interactions generated
   traces of attention, motivation, knowledge, relationships, and resources
   that linked fleeting interactions to emergent organizational structures.
   Our findings point to the importance of internal advocates and
   distributed processes at middle and lower levels for developing
   organizational structures, and we show that advocates' interests,
   commitments, and identities are altered in the course of repeated
   interactions, as are the political resources available to them. Paying
   attention to situation-level interactions thus results in a more dynamic
   view of the emergence of formal structures through political processes.
   We develop a process model that informs structuration perspectives on
   organizational change by showing how social interaction dynamics can
   account for divergent levels of structuring within the same domain. The
   model also advances political perspectives on organizational change by
   unpacking the situational underpinnings of advocacy efforts and
   collective mobilization around issues.},

Abstract = {This study explores how financial executives retrospectively account for

   our investigation through face-to-face interviews with 13 former C-suite

   narratives, characterizing executives' fraud immersion as a
   meaning-making process by which the particulars of the proximal social
   context (the influence of social actors and contextual characteristics)
   and individual motivations collectively molded executives' vocabularies
   of fraud immersion. Our executives' narratives portray their fraud
   entanglement as typically occurring in small, incremental steps. Their
   accounts expand our understanding of the influence of socialization on

Abstract = {Power and status are distinct bases of social hierarchy with unique
   effects. Yet evidence suggests wide variation in whether perceptions of
   status and power are highly correlated versus relatively distinct. We
   use a cross-cultural lens to explain this variation and suggest cultural
   orientation shapes the effect of power on perceived status and vice
   versa. Six studies using various methodologies and samples demonstrate
   that: (1) individuals high (versus low) on vertical collectivism are
   more likely to perceive high power targets as also high in status; (2)
   individuals high (versus low) on horizontal collectivism are more likely
   to perceive high status targets as also high in power; and (3) cultural
   differences in the power-status relationship qualify prior conclusions
   regarding established effects of power and status on one downstream
   consequence-namely, fairness enacted towards others. Implications for
   theory, practice, and future research are discussed.},

Title = {Fostering creativity across countries: The moderating effect of cultural
   bundles on creativity},
Journal = {ORGANIZATIONAL BEHAVIOR AND HUMAN DECISION PROCESSES},

Volume = {157},

Abstract = {Research has traditionally focused on the moderating role of single
   cultural dimensions to capture differences in how individual creativity
   is fostered across cultures. Culture, however, is a multidimensional
   construct, with cultural dimensions operating interdependently. Building
   on this reasoning, we propose that the moderating effect of culture is
   better understood by focusing on the configuration of cultural bundles.
   We define a cultural bundle as the set including the cultural value
   dimensions that characterize a given country, and the strength of the
   norms enforcing these values. We find support for this view in a
   mixed-methods study that combines a meta-analysis of 584 effect sizes
   from 205 studies set in 38 different countries with fuzzy-set
   qualitative comparative analysis (fs/QCA). We discuss the theoretical
   and practical implications of these findings, arguing for the importance
   of focusing on cultural bundles, rather than cultural dimensions in
   isolation, to understand the moderating effect of culture on creativity.},

Title = {Income Smoothing and the Usefulness of Earnings for Monitoring in Debt
   Contracting},
Journal = {CONTEMPORARY ACCOUNTING RESEARCH},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {37},
Number = {2},
Pages = {857-884},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {We investigate whether income smoothing affects the usefulness of
   earnings for contracting through the monitoring role of earnings-based
   debt covenants. First, we examine initial contract design and predict
   that income smoothing will increase (decrease) the use of earnings-based
   covenants if income smoothing improves (reduces) the usefulness of
   earnings to monitor borrowers. We find that private debt contracts to
   borrowers with greater income smoothing are more likely to include
   earnings-based covenants. A structural model that explores the cause of
   this relationship provides evidence that smoothing improves the ability
   of earnings to reflect credit risk. Second, we examine technical default
   following contract inception. We find that income smoothing is
   associated with a lower likelihood of spurious technical default (when
   the borrower's economic performance has not declined but the loan
   nevertheless enters technical default). In contrast, we find no
   association between income smoothing and performance technical default
   (when the borrower's economic performance has declined). Collectively,
   this evidence is consistent with income smoothing improving the
   effectiveness of earnings-based information in monitoring borrowers.},

   Beliefs},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ETHICS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {171},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {This paper explores how consumers perceive retailer ethics. Based on a
   review of the marketing and consumer research literature, we
   conceptualize consumer perceptions of the ethics of retailers (CPER) as
   a multidimensional construct and propose that its effects on consumer
   purchase behavior and word-of-mouth communication are more salient when
   consumers have strong rather than weak ethical beliefs. The model was
   validated using a random sample of 399 respondents in a collectivist
   society. The results of structural equation modeling confirmed that CPER
   is a second-order construct comprising product fairness, price fairness,
   non-deception, fair trade, and green products. CPER positively predicted
   consumer purchase behavior and word-of-mouth communication. Moreover,
   ethical beliefs moderated the positive relationship between CPER and the
   word-of-mouth communication of consumers with strong ethical beliefs but
   did not moderate the relationship between CPER and purchase behavior.
   The implications of the findings are discussed.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT STUDIES},

Volume = {57},
Number = {3, SI},
Pages = {664-697},

Abstract = {The individualism-collectivism culture represents an important and
   well-researched distinction across cultures. Yet research is less clear
   about how the different levels of individualistic cultures in host
   countries affect the success of an increasingly important firm strategy
   - cross-border mergers and acquisitions (CBMAs). This study addresses
   this key research question in the context of Chinese firms' CBMAs, as
   Chinese firms are increasingly acquiring targets outside of China in the
   New Normal global business landscape. This study further theorizes and
   tests how the Chinese acquirer CEOs' characteristics moderate the wealth
   creation relationship. In an analysis of 404 Chinese firms' CBMAs, we
   found that an individualistic culture in the host country is negatively
   associated with Chinese acquirers' CBMA wealth creation. We also
   demonstrate that Chinese CEOs' exposure to foreign culture and female
   gender weaken that negative relationship, while CEO duality strengthens
   this negative relationship. Our research thus suggests that culture in
   host countries can negatively affect acquirers' CBMA performance, but
   CEOs may be able to manage the effects of the culture to increase their
   CBMA performance.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {47},
Number = {5},
Pages = {1134-1154},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Given that many organizations are competitive and finance centered,
   organizational leaders may lead with a primary focus on bottom-line
   attainment, such that they are perceived by their subordinates as having
   a bottom-line mentality (BLM) that entails pursuing bottom-line outcomes
   above all else. Yet, the field is limited in understanding why such a
   leadership approach affects employees' positive and negative
   contributions in the workplace. Drawing on social exchange theory, we
   theorize that supervisors high in BLM can influence employees' felt
   obligation toward the bottom line, which in turn can influence
   employees' task performance and unethical pro-organizational behavior
   (UPB). We also examine employee ambition as a moderator of this process.
   Using three-wave, multisource data collected from the financial services
   industry, our results revealed that high-BLM supervisors elevate
   employee task performance as well as UPB by motivating employees' felt
   obligation toward the bottom line. Furthermore, we found that employee
   ambition served as a first-stage moderator, such that the mediated
   relationships were stronger when employee ambition was high as opposed
   to low. Our findings break away from the dominant dysfunctional view of
   BLM and provide a more balanced view of this mentality.},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {In view of the limited consideration for Afrocentric perspectives in
   organisational ethics literature, we examine Employee-Centred Corporate
   Social Responsibility (EC-CSR) from the perspective of Afrocentric
   employees' social expectations. We posit that Afrocentric employees'
   social expectations and the organisational practices for addressing
   these expectations differ from conventional conceptualisation. By
   focusing specifically upon the psychological attributes evolving from
   the fulfilment of employees' social expectations, we argue that
   Afrocentric socio-cultural factors could influence perceived
   organisational support and perceived employee cynicism. We further draw
   upon social exchange theory to explore rational reciprocity (i.e.
   attitude and behaviour) evolving from the fulfilment and breach of
   employees' social expectations at work. Contrary to the rational norm of
   reciprocity, we identify a reciprocity norm within which the breach of
   employees' social expectations could in fact engender positive
   reciprocity rooted in esan reciprocity ideology-an ideology that emerged
   from the ethical tradition of the Yoruba people from Nigeria, West
   Africa. Overall, our paper elucidates the implications of Afrocentric
   peculiarities for employees' social exchange within the African
   workplace, thus extending the present understanding in this regard.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {57},
Number = {1},
Pages = {134-155},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The authors propose a new conceptual basis for predicting when and why
   consumers match others' consumption choices. Specifically, they
   distinguish between ordinal ({''}ranked{''}) versus nominal
   ({''}unranked{''}) attributes and propose that consumers are more likely
   to match others on ordinal than on nominal attributes. Eleven studies
   involving a range of different ways of operationalizing ordinal versus
   nominal attributes collectively support this hypothesis. The authors'
   conceptualization helps resolve divergent findings in prior literature
   and provides guidance to managers on how to leverage information about
   prior customers' choices and employees' recommendations to shape and
   predict future customers' choices. Furthermore, the authors find process
   evidence that this effect is driven in part by consumers' beliefs that a
   failure to match on ordinal (but not nominal) attributes will lead to
   social discomfort for one or both parties. Although the primary focus is
   on food choices, the effects are also demonstrated in other domains,
   extending the generalizability of the findings and implications for
   managerial practice and theory. Finally, the conceptual framework offers
   additional paths for future research.},

Abstract = {Actors in data-intensive industries at times deliberately induce and
   reproduce organizational ignorance by engaging in over-production of
   data. This observation leads the paper to make two claims. First,
   members of these industries fetishize data excess not in order to
   reduce, but in order to reproduce and stabilize organizational
   ignorance. Second, in this process of fetishization, organizational
   ignorance gives rise to forms of collective effervescence similar to
   that found in totemistic religions. This effervescence allows
   organizational actors to draw defining lines around that which is marked
   as awe-inspiring, dangerous and off-limits, namely the sacred. In
   reviewing organizational ignorance from the perspective of the sacred,
   this paper proposes that, paradoxically, contemporary forms of data
   creation allow companies and industries to organize themselves around
   ignorance as opposed to the promise of knowledge and insight. The paper
   uses this theoretical proposal in order to outline the contours of an
   alternative ontology of organizational ignorance, one that understands
   this phenomenon in terms of excessive presence of data and information.},

Abstract = {The expropriation of marginalized women's labor is a key issue in
   business ethics in these times of global outsourcing and informal work
   arrangements. This has led to a transnational advocacy movement for
   securing the labor rights of homeworkers, who are poor women working on
   piece-rate contracts out of their homes. Drawing on materialist
   feminism, our paper critically explores the homeworker network in
   Pakistan, that was set up as part of a global push by international
   institutions and networks to localize the issue across geographies. Our
   focus is the national women's NGO that leads advocacy efforts on the
   issue in the country and its relationship with other actors. Through
   fieldwork spanning 3 years we find that the network employs a top-down
   `us versus them' approach in advocacy and mobilization. The
   race-to-the-bottom between the network's national and district-level
   actors for donor funding further undermines prospects for developing
   indigenous narratives of resistance. The network, while mission bound to
   enhance the collective agency of its constituency, has depoliticized
   what should have been a class-based feminist struggle. From a
   materialist perspective, we conclude that the NGOized network rests upon
   and feeds off of its constituency, creating an additional layer of
   primitive accumulation over the workers it represents.},

Abstract = {This paper assesses whether societal culture moderates the relationship
   between human resource management (HRM) practices and organizational
   performance. Drawing on matched employer-employee data from 387
   organizations and 7187 employees in 14 countries, our findings show a
   positive relationship between HRM practices combined in High-Performance
   Work Systems (HPWS) and organizational performance across societal
   cultures. Three dimensions of societal culture assessed (power distance,
   in-group collectivism, and institutional collectivism) did not moderate
   this relationship. Drawing on the Ability-Motivation-Opportunity (AMO)
   model, we further consider the effectiveness of three bundles of HRM
   practices (skill-enhancing, motivation-enhancing, and
   opportunity-enhancing practices). This analysis shows
   opportunity-enhancing practices (e.g., participative work design and
   decision-making) are less effective in high-power-distance cultures.
   Nevertheless, in markedly different countries we find combinations of
   complementary HPWS and bundles of AMO practices appear to outweigh the
   influence of societal culture and enhance organizational performance.},

Title = {When the Law Distinguishes Between the Enterprise and the Corporation:
   The Case of the New French Law on Corporate Purpose},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ETHICS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {171},
Number = {1},
Pages = {1-13},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {A recent French reform has revised the legal definition of the
   corporation. In essence, the law stipulates that the corporation must be
   run with due regard to the social and environmental impacts of its
   activity. It also introduces the notion of raison d'etre and affords the
   possibility for any corporation to assign social or environmental
   purposes to itself, defined in its by-laws. This reform is similar to
   recent reforms in the UK and the US, but is based on an original and
   distinctive theoretical argument. The aim of our article is to analyze
   the fundamental tenets of this reform and their implications for the
   theory of the corporation. It shows that the new law is based on a new
   positive definition of the enterprise as not only an economic
   organization or a productive entity, but more fundamentally a space for
   innovative collective action. We argue that this view of the enterprise
   challenges our conceptualization of the corporation in two important
   ways. First, it shows that the traditional theories overlook the
   activities of the enterprise and their related impacts, and that the
   corporation is not necessarily the appropriate legal vehicle for the
   innovative enterprise. Second, it suggests that the stipulation of the
   enterprise's purpose or raison d'etre in the corporate by-laws can
   provide new promising legal foundations for corporate responsibility.},

Journal = {ENTREPRENEURSHIP THEORY AND PRACTICE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {45},
Number = {2},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Firms are more prone to allocate their resources to research and
   development (R\&D) when they are confident about their ability to
   appropriate the value created through these activities. In this regard,
   policymakers introduce formal intellectual property rights (IPR)
   institutions to create an innovation-friendly environment. Less
   formalized shared values and norms are however likely to affect the
   extent to which organizations depend on the strength of formal
   institutions in determining their R\&D strategy. Embracing an
   institution-based perspective on firm-level strategic decision-making,
   we examine whether the degree to which a firm relies on strong formal
   IPR institutions in R\&D decisions depends on the configuration of
   informal institutions in its environment, including family and societal
   culture. We test our hypotheses on a representative sample of
   privately-held European manufacturing firms and find that the family
   institution can play an ``institutional void filling{''} role through
   involvement in ownership and management. This is particularly the case
   when the firm is embedded in a collectivist culture coherent with the
   family's values and norms imbued in the business. Our study offers
   contributions to the institution-based view, innovation, and family

Title = {The firm as an architect of polycentric governance: Building open
   institutional infrastructure in emerging markets},
Journal = {STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT JOURNAL},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {44},
Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {48-85},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Research Summary We apply pattern-matching techniques to contrast
   qualitative case study data with perspectives from strategic management
   and institutional economics about how a firm can address voids in
   market-based institutions. We identify a novel approach whereby the firm
   builds an open institutional infrastructure (OII) by investing in a pool
   of resources widely accessible beyond its exchange partners. To
   collectively govern OII, the firm must empower other actors within
   multilateral cross-sector partnerships, and it must enforce the
   resulting rules through relational norms based on alignment between
   public and private value creation. These findings, achieved by adapting
   Elinor Ostrom's principles of polycentric governance to corporate actors
   who take the lead in building OII, advance our understanding of new
   organizational forms that transcend the traditional boundaries of firms
   and markets.
   Managerial Summary Emerging markets typically present additional
   obstacles for business operations because they lack the necessary
   underlying institutional infrastructure such as access to capital and
   labor markets. We introduce a new way for firms to overcome these
   obstacles-which we call building an OII-by investing in such
   infrastructure themselves and making it available to their commercial
   partners, local communities, and even to competitors. Firms must empower
   those actors to take the lead in collectively defining the rules for

Journal = {HUMAN RELATIONS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {73},
Number = {4, SI},
Pages = {544-571},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {This article introduces turning points - fleeting moments of change - to
   suggest one way of studying collective leadership which allows to unpack
   moments that connect and explore how co-action unfolds. How can
   co-action and collective leadership processes be studied without falling
   back on individual-centric methods? To answer the question, I link
   Gergen's work on responsive interplay to the study of leadership as the
   seeking of direction in the production of a space for co-action. I use
   empirical material from SocialORG to develop a leadership trajectory
   which shows how participants come together, on the one hand, to define a
   space for co-action that embodies both past experiences and projections
   for the future and, on the other to achieve co-action through different
   ways of relating. The three interrelated objectives of the article are:
   first, to demonstrate how matters of concern become matters of
   collective engagement. Second, to move the focus of inquiry from single
   instances towards the leadership process across time and conceptualize
   the individual as relational being, shifting away from individualist
   theorizing. Third, to discuss the inner workings of the methodology to
   encourage its replication and highlight immersion into the empirical
   setting to identify turning points.},

Title = {Catering to Otherness: Levinasian Consumer Ethics at Restaurant Day},

Year = {2021},
Volume = {168},
Number = {2, SI},
Pages = {261-276},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {There is a rich tradition of inquiry in consumer research into how
   collective consumption manifests in various forms and contexts. While
   this literature has shown how group cohesion prescribes ethical and
   moral positions, our study explores how ethicality can arise from
   consumers and their relations in a more emergent fashion. To do so, we
   present a Levinasian perspective on consumer ethics through a focus on
   Restaurant Day, a global food carnival that is organized by consumers
   themselves. Our ethnographic findings highlight a non-individualistic
   way of approaching ethical subjectivity that translates into acts of
   catering to the needs of other people and the subversion of extant
   legislation by foregrounding personal responsibility. These findings
   show that while consumer gatherings provide participants a license to
   temporarily subvert existing roles, they also allow the possibility of
   ethical autonomy when the mundane rules of city life are renegotiated.
   These sensibilities also create `ethical surplus', which is an affective
   excess of togetherness. In the Levinasian register, Restaurant Day thus
   acts as an inarticulable `remainder'-atraceof the possibility of being
   able to live otherwise alongside one another in city contexts.},

Abstract = {In this introductory essay, we outline the relationship between
   political dissensus and radical democracy, focusing especially on how
   such a politics might inform the study of business ethics. This politics
   is located historically in the failure of liberal democracy to live up
   to its promise, as well as the deleterious response to that from
   reactionary populism, strong-man authoritarianism, and exploitative
   capitalism. In the context of these political vicissitudes, we turn to
   radical democracy as a form of contestation that offers hope in an
   affirmative, inclusive and sustainable alternative. On this basis we
   introduce the papers in the special issue as a collective exploration of
   the ethics and politics of radical democracy as manifesting in dissensus
   and the subversion of corporate and elite power by alternative
   democratic practices and realities.},

Pages = {200-222},

Abstract = {Building on work at the individual and organizational levels suggesting
   that an individual's self-concept and an organization's identity are
   dynamic, we relax the generally held assumption that perceptions of
   organizational identification are perceived as relatively stable over
   time and highlight the importance of understanding the perceived
   dynamism in members' relationships with their organizations over broader
   time horizons. We introduce various identification trajectories-a
   member's current perception of how his or her identification has evolved
   and will evolve over time-and investigate the sense of momentum that
   characterizes these trajectories. We also generate theory about the
   different action tendencies created by various types of trajectories and
   examine their influence on cognition, affect, and behavior in the
   present. Our theoretical model helps to explain why two members of the
   same organization with similar degrees of identification in the present
   might think, feel, and behave quite differently. In addition, our
   theoretical perspective enables us to understand why high (or low)
   identifiers might display cognition, affect, and behavior typically
   associated with low (or high) degrees of identification.},

Abstract = {Myth is a meta-language that shapes our cultures and the way we
   individually and collectively make sense of reality. This paper presents
   the methodologies of French anthropologist and sociologist Gilbert
   Durand as a way to unveil how ancient myths contribute to the symbolic
   construction of societal leaders in times of crisis. To do so, it
   analyses the controversy of the selection of Time magazine's Person of
   the Year, which confronted the figures of Julien Assange and Mark
   Zuckerberg. The myth analysis of their Wikipedia biographies will show
   that despite the fact these two personalities are considered almost
   opposites, the structure of the collective shared narratives about each
   of them follow the structure of the myth of Hermes, one shaping the
   grand narrative of the postmodern era. Realizing why and how the myth of
   Hermes promotes our contemporary leaders, sometimes apparent
   antagonists, contributes to better understanding of the unconscious
   drives of their symbolic construction, and enabling critical engagement
   with the rationales of their emergence.},

   Teams},
Journal = {ORGANIZATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {31},
Number = {1},
Pages = {141-164},
Month = {JAN-FEB},
Abstract = {We develop and test a theoretical model that explains how collective
   psychological ownership-shared feelings of joint possession over
   something-emerges within new creative teams that were launched to
   advance one person's (i.e., a creative lead's) preconceived idea. Our
   model proposes that such teams face a unique challenge-an initial
   asymmetry in feelings of psychological ownership for the idea between
   the creative lead who conceived the idea and new team members who are
   beginning to work on the idea. We suggest that the creative lead can
   resolve this asymmetry and foster the emergence of collective
   psychological ownership by enacting two interpersonal behaviors-help
   seeking and territorial marking. These behaviors build collective
   ownership by facilitating the unifying centripetal force of team
   identification and preventing the divisive centrifugal force of team
   ownership conflict. Our model also proposes that collective ownership
   positively relates to the early success of new creative teams. The
   results of a quantitative study of 79 creative teams participating in an
   entrepreneurship competition provided general support for our
   predictions but also suggested refinements as to how a creative lead's
   behavior influences team dynamics. The findings of a subsequent
   qualitative investigation of 27 teams participating in a university
   startup launch course shed additional light on how collective ownership
   emerges in new creative teams launched to advance one person's idea.},

Abstract = {Public discourse on current inequalities often invokes past injustice
   endured by minorities. This rhetoric also sometimes underlies
   contemporary equality policies. Drawing on social identity theory and
   the employment equity literature, we suggest that reminding people about
   past injustice against a disadvantaged group (e.g., women) can invoke
   social identity threat among advantaged group members (e.g., men) and
   undermine support for employment equity (EE) policies by fostering the
   belief that inequality no longer exists. We find support for our
   hypotheses in four studies examining Canadian (three studies) and
   American (one study) EE policies. Overall, we found that reminders of
   past injustice toward women undermined men's support for an EE policy
   promoting women by heightening their denial of current gender
   discrimination. Supporting a social identity account, men's responses
   were mediated by collective self-esteem, and were attenuated when threat
   was mitigated. Reminders of past injustice did not influence women's
   support for the EE policy.},

   country-months, that the United States is the only country with a
   reliable post-publication decline in long-short returns. Collectively,
   our meta-analysis of return predictors suggests that barriers to
   arbitrage trading can create segmented markets and that anomalies tend
   to represent mispricing instead of data mining. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {This article examines the relationship between organizational ethics,
   the uncanny, and the annual celebration of Halloween. We begin by
   exploring the traditional and contemporary organizational function of
   Halloween as `tension-management ritual' (Etzioni, Sociol Theory
   18(1):44-59, 2000) through which collective fears, anxieties, and
   fantasies are played out and given material expression. Combining the
   uncanny with the folkloric concept of ostension, we then examine an
   incident in which UK supermarket retailers made national news headlines
   for selling offensive Halloween costumes depicting `escaped mental
   patients'. Rather than treating this incident as a problem of moral
   hygiene-in which products are removed, apologies made, and lessons
   learned-we consider the value of Halloween as a unique and disruptive
   ethical encounter with the uncanny Other. Looking beyond its commercial
   appeal and controversy, we reflect on the creative, generous, and
   disruptive potential of Halloween as both tension-management ritual and
   unique organizational space of hospitality through which to receive and
   embrace alterity and so discover the homely within the unheimlich.},

Title = {<i>Hold Your Horses</i>: Temporal Multiplexity and Conflict Moderation
   in the Palio di Siena (1743-2010)},
Journal = {ORGANIZATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {31},
Number = {1},
Pages = {85-102},
Month = {JAN-FEB},
Abstract = {The paper elaborates the concept of temporal multiplexity, defined as
   the overlaying of ties of different duration, such as transient
   employment and enduring organizational ties. This concept is
   instrumental in resolving long-standing challenges in network research,
   such as capturing the interplay between different levels of analysis or
   time horizons. This is made possible by longitudinal network and
   mobility data (1743-2010) from the Palio di Siena-the famous horse race
   in Siena, Italy. The outcome of interest is Palio-related collective
   violence. The analysis shows that relationally loaded organizational
   ties of rivalry or friendship increase the likelihood of incidents,
   whereas mobility along the same lines reduces it. The results support
   sociological arguments that symmetrical social space of friendship or
   rivalry is conducive to conflict. Mobility is a factor of moderation- by
   connecting employers within the actor and transferring relational
   content between them, it creates misalignment between the assumption of
   a role and fulfillment of its expectations. Mobility relaxes the
   relational constraints of jockeys, reducing their compliance with
   bellicose demands. The uncertainty resulting from mobility may have a
   collective benefit that is ignored by employers: the moderation of
   conflict.},

Journal = {ORGANIZATIONAL BEHAVIOR AND HUMAN DECISION PROCESSES},

Volume = {156},
Pages = {69-81},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Many ideas and products are borne out of collaborative efforts among
   members of teams and workgroups, and thus finding ways to improve team
   creativity is of significant interest. Adopting a collective information
   processing perspective, we argue that gratitude intervention for teams
   would serve as a powerful facilitator for information
   elaboration-whereby team members engage in more deliberate and thorough
   integration of others' ideas-and, in turn, enhance team creativity.
   Study 1 found that teams in the gratitude condition increased
   information elaboration more than those in the neutral condition. Study
   2 compared teams in gratitude emotion and teams in positive emotion in
   general. Teams in the gratitude condition generated highly creative
   ideas, due to more information elaboration. On the other hand, teams in
   the positive emotion condition expressed greater enthusiasm and
   confidence in their ideas and immediately accepted the ideas suggested,
   which led to an increase in the quantity of ideas. Our findings suggest
   that gratitude facilitates intellectual exchange in groups, which in
   turn enhances team creativity. We discuss our findings' implications for
   team creativity and potential directions for future research.},

Title = {Complementors' engagement in an ecosystem: A study of publishers' e-book
   offerings on Amazon Kindle},
Journal = {STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT JOURNAL},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {41},
Number = {1},
Pages = {3-26},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Research Summary In ecosystems, tensions between value creation and
   appropriation can arise when complementors form relationships with a
   partner that benefits from network effects. While creating value
   collectively, these relationships strengthen the network effects, which
   increase the partner's ability to appropriate value. We posit that
   complementors strategize their product offerings to benefit from the
   relationship with the partner while preserving bargaining power by
   keeping relationships with other partners as outside options. We examine
   book publishers' product portfolios in the Amazon Kindle e-book and the
   printed book ecosystems. Our results illuminate specific product
   offering decisions by large publishers that are more protective of the
   printed book ecosystem and less conducive to Kindle's success. This
   research adds to the literature on interorganizational relationships,
   platform ecosystems, and managing digital innovations. Managerial
   Summary How do book publishers deal with Amazon? This paper compares
   book publishers' product offerings on Amazon's Kindle digital platform
   and in the physical print channel. We find that publishers offer high
   demand products as e-books on Kindle to benefit from logistics savings.
   Yet, relative to small publishers, large publishers product decisions
   that support Kindle less, such as withholding some of their greatest
   revenue generating books. Such decisions could both limit Kindle's
   attractiveness to the consumers and preserve the economic viability of
   the print channel as an outside option. These findings improve our
   understanding of how companies can leverage their product portfolios to
   both benefit from digital technology efficiencies and maintain their
   bargaining power vis-a-vis digital platforms.},

Abstract = {Leader identity has traditionally been associated with hierarchical
   position (formal leadership). Yet, while there is an increasing tendency
   to regard leadership as a collective and distributed process, very
   little is known about the interplay of formal and informal leadership as
   in situ social practice within a hierarchical context. Using
   video-recordings of naturally occurring workplace interaction as data
   and arguing that insights from applied linguistics can be profitably
   employed to address such a lacuna, we use multimodal conversation
   analysis (CA) to show how `doing' leadership is not limited to the
   formal leader. Rather, through talk, gaze, the use of space, artefacts
   and so on, it is negotiated in subtle ways which allow informal
   leadership to emerge in conjunction, and in this case in conflict, with
   formal leadership. We conclude this article by discussing the wider
   implications of these findings to both leadership theory and
   methodologies used to investigate the `just whatness' of leadership.},

   to address these challenges. The purpose of this article is to
   demonstrate the utility of these methodological approaches for
   addressing major methodological challenges within the field of
   collective leadership. Through this effort, we aim to facilitate
   conversation across disparate streams of research and encourage
   researchers to explore how novel research questions and perspectives

Journal = {HUMAN RELATIONS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {73},
Number = {4, SI},
Pages = {516-543},

Abstract = {Collective leadership is cast as a new and emerging paradigm. However,
   for many Indigenous communities, collective leadership has been a way of
   life through the millennia. Where mainstream models of collective
   leadership focus on what people do, think, and feel in the here and now,
   we argue such an approach ignores contributions of other generations.
   The Maori ecosystems view set out in this article positions a
   revolutionary departure from previous work on collective leadership
   because of the extraordinary set of relationships it encompasses,
   including those across generations and across living and non-living
   entities. Meeting this special issue's call for innovative research
   methodologies, our work is informed by the ancient practice of wananga,
   which challenges secular, reductionist, quantitative research. Wananga
   traverses time and space and involves a quality of consciousness that
   brings forth an integrated collective intelligence. Inquiring into three
   watershed leadership moments, we show that collective Maori leadership
   is an ecosystem held together by activating a knowledge code,
   cultivating ties of affection, and working the tensions. Unlike the `new
   broom sweeps clean' approach where incoming leaders tend to discard the
   work of predecessors, true collective leadership is an integrated
   ecosystem sustained from one generation of leadership to the next.},

Abstract = {There has been an upsurge of interest regarding how actors engage with
   art within organizational processes. However, scholars have tended not
   to study the role of art within contemporary collective labour
   organizing. This article focuses on how participatory art may support
   flat, participative labour organizing, particularly among marginalized,
   relatively powerless workers. We present an ethnographic account of how
   art practices are deeply embedded within the flat organizing processes
   of Justice for Domestic Workers, a self-organizing group of migrant
   domestic workers in London. We reflect on this case to theorize the art
   of flat organizing, an ideal type of a set of participatory art
   practices that are compatible with and supportive of flat labour
   organizing.},

   mitigate the negative effects of consumer animosity and support the

Abstract = {We develop the concept of the distant future as a new way of seeing the
   future in collective efforts. While a near future is represented in
   practical terms and concerned with forming expectations and goals under
   conditions of uncertainty, a distant future is represented in stylized
   terms and concerned with imagining possibilities under conditions of
   ambiguity. Management research on future-oriented action has developed
   around problems of the near future. To explore distant futures, we
   analyze the case of geoengineering, a set of planetary-scale
   technologies that have been proposed as solutions to the threat of
   climate change. Geoengineering has increasingly been treated as if it
   were a reality, despite continued controversy and the absence of any
   implementation. We find that societal-level imaginaries that were built
   on deeply held moral bases and cosmologies underpinned the conception of
   geoengineering, and that a dialectic process of discursive attempts to
   reconcile oppositional imaginaries increased the concreteness and
   credibility of geoengineering so that it has increasingly been treated
   as an ``as-if{''} reality. We suggest that distant futures orient
   collective efforts in distinctive ways, not as concrete guides for
   action but by expressing critiques and alternatives, that can become
   treated as as-if realities.},

Abstract = {We employ the European Central Bank's Loan-level Reporting Initiative as
   a shock to banks' asset disclosures. We find that after the disclosure
   regulation, treatment banks raise more capital at cheaper rates and
   increase lending. Using novel survey data on small businesses, we also
   document that, in regimes with heightened bank disclosures, borrowers
   receive greater funding, conditional on their demand for credit.
   Furthermore, companies whose relationship banks provide asset
   disclosures start to borrow and invest more relative to firms from the
   same country and industry. Collectively, our inferences suggest that
   asset disclosures alleviate the capital market frictions that banks face
   and allow them to supply more credit to the real economy.},

Abstract = {Little is known about how social entrepreneurs try to induce enactment

   Through a longitudinal study, we analyze how anti-plastic pollution
   social entrepreneurs use multimodal (visual and verbal) interactions to
   influence their targets and promote their cause. Our findings reveal
   that these social entrepreneurs use what we call ``emotion-symbolic
   work,{''} which involves using visuals and words to elicit negative
   emotions through moral shock, and then transforming those emotions into
   emotional energy for enactment. The emotional transformation process
   entails connecting target actors to a cause, a collective identity, and
   the social entrepreneurs themselves. Our exploration of emotion-symbolic
   work offers new ways of seeing by emphasizing the use of multimodal
   interactions to affect emotions in efforts to influence target actors to
   enact a cause.},

Title = {Supply Chain Contracts That Prevent Information Leakage},
Journal = {MANAGEMENT SCIENCE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {65},
Number = {12},
Pages = {5619-5650},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {This paper determines categories of contracts that facilitate vertical
   information sharing in a supply chain while precluding horizontal
   information leakage among competing newsvendors. We consider a supply
   chain in which retailers replenish inventory from a common supplier to
   satisfy uncertain demand and are engaged in newsvendor competition. Each
   retailer has imperfect demand information. Yet one of the retailers (the
   incumbent) has a more accurate demand forecast than the other (the
   entrant). Information leakage among such competing retailers precludes
   vertical information sharing and is often the reason for many retailers
   to abandon collaborative forecast-sharing initiatives, leading to
   suboptimized supply chains. We show that whether a contract can prevent
   information leakage depends on how the inventory risk (i.e., cost of
   supply-demand mismatch) is allocated among the supplier and retailers in
   conjunction with the allocation of profits. We categorize contracts
   according to how they allocate inventory risk among firms when compared
   with a wholesale-price contract. This comparison yields four mutually
   exdusive and collectively exhaustive categories of contracts. A
   downside-protection contract is one that effectively reduces retailers'
   cost of excess inventory by shifting some of their overage cost to the
   supplier. Examples of such contracts include buy-back and
   revenue-sharing contracts. An upside-protection contract is one that
   effectively increases retailers' cost of inventory shortage by shifting
   some of the supplier's underage cost to retailers. Examples of such
   contracts include penalty and rebate contracts. A two-sided protection
   contract combines the properties of the previous two categories. A
   no-protection contract is one that fails to shift firms' cost of
   inventory shortage or excess from one to the other. Examples of such
   contracts include wholesale-price and two-part tariff contracts. We show
   that no-protection contracts, which are extensively used in practice,
   cannot prevent information leakage, whereas others may do so. We also
   show that preventing information leakage could be costly for the supply
   chain (i.e., low channel efficiency). We conclude by illustrating how
   our unified framework to study a variety of contracts can enable a firm
   to determine the best-performing contract (among many) that precludes
   information leakage while almost coordinating the channel. For example,
   we show why buy-back contracts perform significantly better than
   revenue-sharing or rebate contracts.},

Title = {The Role of Accelerator Designs in Mitigating Bounded Rationality in New
   Ventures},
Journal = {ADMINISTRATIVE SCIENCE QUARTERLY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {64},
Number = {4},
Pages = {810-854},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Using a nested multiple-case study of participating ventures, directors,
   and mentors of eight of the original U.S. accelerators, we explore how
   accelerators' program designs influence new ventures' ability to access,
   interpret, and process the external information needed to survive and
   grow. Through our inductive process, we illuminate the
   bounded-rationality challenges that may plague all ventures and
   entrepreneurs-not just those in accelerators-and identify the particular
   organizational designs that accelerators use to help address these
   challenges, which left unabated can result in suboptimal performance or
   even venture failure. Our analysis revealed three key design choices
   made by accelerators-(1) whether to space out or concentrate
   consultations with mentors and customers, (2) whether to foster privacy
   or transparency between peer ventures participating in the same program,
   and (3) whether to tailor or standardize the program for each
   venture-and suggests a particular set of choices is associated with
   improved venture development. Collectively, our findings provide
   evidence that bounded rationality challenges new ventures differently
   than it does established firms. We find that entrepreneurs appear to
   systematically satisfice prematurely across many decisions and thus
   broadly benefit from increasing the amount of external information
   searched, often by reigniting search for problems that they already view
   as solved. Our study also contributes to research on organizational
   sponsors by revealing practices that help or hinder new venture
   development and to emerging research on the lean start-up methodology by
   suggesting that startups benefit from engaging in deep consultative
   learning prior to experimentation.},

Abstract = {Contemporary expert organizations rely heavily on cross-border, often
   temporary teams typically working through virtual means of
   communication. While static aspects of teams are well researched, there
   have been considerably fewer studies on team dynamics and team
   processes. Existing process studies tend to take a cautious,
   entity-based approach, emphasizing team structure as much as (or even
   more than) processual aspects. This article represents a shift from
   studying teams as entities and structures changing over time to studying
   teams as an on-going process. Participants engage in teaming and thus in
   the continued making and sometimes unmaking of teams. We report on a
   study of three anatomically similar, self-managed teams performing the
   same set of complex tasks with radically different teaming processes.
   With more or less successful shared sensemaking, the team members
   collectively create (or fail to create) not only team task outputs but
   also the team itself.},

   Our framework allows us to characterize matching equilibrium in a

   We allow for the introduction of a general class of additive unobserved
   heterogeneity on agents' preferences. We show existence and uniqueness
   of an equilibrium under minimal assumptions. We provide two algorithms
   to compute the equilibrium in our model. We then show that the
   associated log likelihood has a simple expression and compute its

Title = {Indigenous Insights into Ethical Leadership: A Study of Maori Leaders},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ETHICS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {160},
Number = {3},
Pages = {621-640},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The need for ethical leadership in navigating today's complex, global
   and competitive organisations has been established. While research has
   confirmed the importance of ethical leaders in promoting positive
   organisational and employee outcomes, scant research has examined the
   antecedents of ethical leadership. Furthermore, there has been a call
   for further examination of leadership models, particularly indigenous
   leadership models. Responding to these issues, this study suggests Maori
   leaders' values add insights into enhancing ethical leadership. Three
   studies confirm the role of Maori values and ethical leadership. Study
   one, based on kaupapa Maori research methods, is an exploratory
   22-interview study of Maori leaders and identifies five values,
   (humility, altruism, long-term orientation, collectivism and cultural
   authenticity) as common to successful indigenous leaders. In study two,
   249 employees rate their leaders on these five dimensions in relation to
   their ethical leadership and exchange relationships. Structural equation
   modelling shows strong support for the distinct nature of the five
   values and their positive influence on ethical leadership perceptions
   and quality exchange relationships (LMX). Study three, on 122 employees,
   reinforces the findings of study two-and demonstrates that LMX predicts
   job outcomes both indirectly and directly, with humility and
   collectivism also directly predicting outcomes. Our findings suggest
   that indigenous leaders' values enhance perceptions and outcomes of
   ethical leadership for employees.},

Title = {What Is Dead May Never Die: Institutional Regeneration through Logic
   Reemergence in Dutch Beer Brewing},
Journal = {ADMINISTRATIVE SCIENCE QUARTERLY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {64},
Number = {4},
Pages = {976-1019},

Abstract = {Through an in-depth, historically embedded study of the craft revolution
   in Dutch beer brewing that began in the 1970s, we illuminate how
   organizational fields may experience regenerative change through the
   reemergence of traditional arrangements. The remarkable resurgence of
   craft in this context, following the rapid industrialization of the
   twentieth century that left only industrially produced pilsner in its
   wake, serves as the basis of our process theory of regenerative
   institutional change through logic reemergence. The results of our
   qualitative analysis show that institutional logics that appear dead or
   decomposed may never truly die, as they leave remnants behind that field
   actors can rediscover, repurpose, and reuse at later stages. We show
   how, in the Netherlands, networks of individuals that had access to the
   remnants of craft brewing were regenerated, in part fueled by increasing
   exposure to British, Belgian, and German craft brewing, and how these
   networks ultimately succeeded in reviving traditional prescriptions for
   beer and brewing, as well as restoring previously abandoned brewery
   forms and technologies and beer styles. These activities led not only to
   a sudden proliferation of alternatives to the dominant industrial
   pilsner but also to fundamental changes in the meaning and organization
   of beer brewing, as they were associated with the reinvigoration of
   institutional orders that preceded those of the corporation and the
   market. Yet we also observe how, on the ground, remnants of traditional
   craft often needed to be blended with contemporaneous elements from
   modern industrialism, as well as foreign representations of craft, to
   facilitate reemergence. We thus argue that regenerative institutional
   change likely resembles a dualistic process of restoration and
   transformation.},

   Responsibility? The Foucauldian Ethics of Ubiquitous IT Uses in

Journal = {JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ETHICS},

Volume = {160},

Abstract = {The ethical issues introduced by excessive uses of ubiquitous
   information technology (IT) at work have received little attention, from
   either practitioners or ethics scholars. This article suggests the
   concept of technological ill-being and explores the ethical issues
   arising from such ill-being, according to the individual and collective
   responsibilities associated with their negative effects. This article
   turns to the philosopher Michel Foucault and proposes a renewed approach
   of the relationship among IT, ethics, and responsibility, based on the
   concepts of practical rationality, awareness, and self-engagement. This
   article reports a case study of an international automotive company
   actively engaged in both corporate social responsibility (CSR) and
   ubiquitous IT deployment. Technological ill-being is an expression of
   the tension between an individual's social attributes and aspirations
   when using modern IT and a system of norms, rules, and values imposing
   constraints on him or her. We identify the reasons for the lack of
   consideration of technological ill-being in CSR through identification
   of the inclusion-exclusion principle. The resulting critical,
   comprehensive approach to corporate responsibilities and IT uses
   incorporates the ethical implications of the latter, highlights the
   practical rationality of their relationship, and demands both individual
   and collective responses, through a call for collective ethical
   awareness and self-engagement. The findings prompt a Foucauldian ethics
   of IT use in organizations, which emerges in a mutually constitutive
   relationship between the self, as a moral subject of own actions, and
   broader organizational principles, in which CSR appears as a techne
   (i.e., a practical rationality governed by conscious aims).},

   advantages to new markets, emphasizing in particular the idea of
   bottlenecks. We then propose a framework that can be applied to future
   research on digital platforms, focusing on the users, suppliers of

Abstract = {The essence of a brand is that it delivers on its promises. However,
   consumers' trust in brands (CTB) has declined around the world in recent
   decades. As a result, CTB has become a major concern for managers. The
   authors examine whether CTB is influenced by marketing-mix activities
   (i.e., advertising, new product introduction, distribution, price, and
   price promotion) implemented by brands. The authors propose and show
   that the sensitivity of CTB to marketing-mix activities is moderated by
   consumer, category, and country characteristics, using a multisource
   data set consisting of a survey of 15,073 respondents and scanner panel
   data on 589 brands in 46 CPG categories across 13 countries (including
   the four largest emerging markets), which collectively account for half
   of the world's population. The authors find strong positive effects for
   advertising and new product introduction intensity, weak positive
   effects for price and distribution intensity, and a minor negative
   effect for price promotion intensity on CTB. Furthermore, the authors
   find that the effect of marketing-mix activities on CTB is moderated by
   consumers' personality traits, consumers' reliance on brands in a
   category, and countries' secular-rational and self-expression cultural
   values.},

Title = {Placing their bets: The influence of strategic investment on CEO
   pay-for-performance},

Abstract = {Research Summary A number of studies examine the extent to which boards
   compensate CEOs for their firm's performance (i.e.,
   pay-for-performance), but these studies typically do not incorporate
   what CEOs actually do to bring about those performance outcomes. We
   suggest that directors will make stronger internal attributions about
   firm performance when the CEO engages in high levels of corporate
   strategic investment. CEOs that invest in firm growth essentially
   ``place their bets,{''} so the pay-for-performance relationship is
   stronger for them than it is for CEOs who do not invest as much in firm
   growth. We also theorize and find that directors make internal
   attributions about firm performance more for prestigious, but not less
   prestigious, CEOs and more when the directors collectively exhibit
   conservative, but not liberal, political ideologies. Managerial Summary
   Shareholders and other stakeholders often demand that CEOs should be
   paid for performance. In other words, CEOs should be paid well when the
   company is performing well and paid less when the company is not
   performing well. We add an additional dimension: boards might also
   consider what CEOs actually do to bring about performance outcomes. Our
   findings suggest that when CEOs make heavy corporate investments, they
   essentially ``place their bets.{''} In this scenario, boards attribute
   performance to the CEO so that CEO compensation rises and falls with
   company performance. When CEOs make fewer corporate investments, their
   compensation is not as strongly associated with company performance.
   This primary relationship is particularly true when CEOs have high
   social recognition or when the directors are collectively conservative.},

Abstract = {This paper examines whether banks strategically incorporate their
   competitors' liquidity mismatch policies when determining their own and
   the impact of these collective decisions on financial stability. Using a
   novel identification strategy exploiting the presence of partially
   overlapping peer groups, I show that banks' liquidity transformation
   activity is driven by that of their peers. These correlated decisions
   are concentrated on the asset side of riskier banks and are asymmetric,
   with mimicking occurring only when competitors take more risk.
   Accordingly, this strategic behavior increases banks' default risk and
   overall systemic risk, highlighting the importance of regulating
   liquidity risk from a macroprudential perspective.},

Volume = {64},
Number = {4},
Pages = {773-809},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {We develop a theory of how state officials' political incentives can
   affect corporate behavior. In the pursuit of multiple goals, such as
   social stability and economic development, the state designs criteria to
   evaluate its officials' performance. Those officials may be motivated to
   prioritize different goals at different stages of their careers and to
   mobilize firms to help them achieve those goals. We test our theory in
   the context of Chinese publicly listed firms' diversification between
   2001 and 2011, when the state faced economic and social ramifications of
   bankrupt state-owned enterprises (SOEs) laying off large numbers of
   workers. Our results show that when large layoffs occurred, some firms
   diversified into industries unrelated to their core business by
   acquiring bankrupt SOEs and reemploying their workers. This was more
   likely to occur when the governor of the firm's home province was closer
   to retirement, as social stability was more important than economic
   development for the retiring governor's career objective. The effect of
   career stage was weaker for Communist Party leaders, who more
   consistently prioritized social stability, and when a provincial state
   experienced intense collective actions that made social stability a
   stronger immediate focus. The effect was strengthened for firms more
   vulnerable to officials' influence, such as those with a strong
   socialist imprint and those dependent on government resources. Our study
   extends the Weberian state literature and the political economy research
   on incentives, and it offers a political explanation for corporate
   diversification in a major transitional economy.},

Volume = {74},
Number = {6},

Abstract = {The promise of leadership being spread across levels and parts of an
   organisation beckons scholars and practitioners alike, yet the theory
   and practice of it remains partial and elusive. We show how
   cross-hierarchical leadership understanding and practice might be better
   embedded in organisations through discursive resources with the
   potential to connect groups, even temporarily, across asymmetrical power
   relations. Our study empirically draws on a rare leadership development
   workshop bringing together chief executives and frontline leadership to
   explore the complexities of leadership in a health and safety context.
   This inquiry draws iteratively between workshop interactions and
   subsequent interviewing of those present to identify discursive
   resources firstly hindering and secondly contributing to moments of
   pluralising and spreading leadership. Whereas frontline leadership drew
   on discourses of embedding, collaborative and grounding leadership, and
   chief executives alternatively on analytic, overseeing and cascading
   discourses, our interest was provoked by the shared discursive resources
   of reframing identities, constructing intermediaries, overcoming
   distance, sparking engagement and inviting translation with the
   potential to loop hierarchy and bring power relations across
   hierarchical differences into (re)negotiation.},

Abstract = {This study performs a comprehensive examination of organizational

   we worked with the company records of a multinational fashion retail
   group with more than 4,000 stores grouped into eight different brands
   and 100,000 employees in more than 31 countries. To estimate the causal
   contextual effects of the relationship between voluntary managerial
   turnover and organizational performance, we designed a quasi-experiment
   using propensity score matching analysis. Our results show that the
   dysfunctional side of managerial turnover is significant for stores that
   are large, for stores managed under a primary employment system, for
   brands operating with higher levels of service orientation, and for
   countries with more restrictive employment protection legislation. We
   discuss the implications of these findings for practice and for future

Abstract = {What are the practices through which resistance leadership transitions
   from marginality to power? We present a framework of dramaturgical
   resistance leadership, paying particular attention to the relational
   dynamics between leaders, internal factions and external stakeholders.
   In doing so, we draw on an `expanded' social drama analysis framework
   informed by the work of social anthropologist Victor Turner,
   incorporating insights from the resistance and critical leadership
   studies literatures. We develop our framework through a narrative case
   analysis of the British Labour Party's 2015 and 2016 internal elections
   of its current leader Jeremy Corbyn where we identify a space between
   the phases of relational crisis and redress that offers possibilities
   for the enhancement and growth of resistance leadership. Within this
   space, we identify three practices of dramaturgical resistance
   leadership: `anti-establishment leadering', `organizational redrawing',
   and a `trifold focus'. These offer a means of rethinking the purpose and
   role of leaders within resistance movements alongside the co-constituted
   relations and generative practices that enable resisting groups to gain
   traction.},

Abstract = {This article introduces the Special Issue concerned with organizational
   spirituality, symbolism and storytelling. Stressing the growing
   scholarly interest in these topics, the article makes a two-fold
   contribution. First, it critically assesses their development over time
   while identifying the emerging trends and new ways in which
   spirituality, symbolism and storytelling are taken up in management and
   organization studies. We make a case for utilizing their promise to
   transcend the epistemic boundaries and extend the scope of our academic
   practice beyond self-referential approaches or `fashionable' topics.
   Second, it links them to what we term the current crises of imagination,
   calling into question extant institutional and organizational paradigms,
   as well as the theoretical frames we rely on in our teaching and
   research. The multiple crises we face - economic, financial, food,
   water, energy, climate, migration and security - we suggest, are partly
   due to the fragmentation of meaning that bedevils our scholarship and,
   implicitly, the failure of our collective imagination. Reaching across
   foundational disciplines and core methodologies, we bring into the
   conversation the interlocking fields of spirituality, symbolism and
   storytelling, highlighting their potential for addressing the cardinal
   challenges we face as citizens of this world as much as organizational
   scholars.},

Abstract = {Collective leadership arrangements in which two people jointly occupy a
   shared leadership role space are often thought to enable the bridging of
   competing demands and sources of expertise and legitimacy in pluralistic
   settings where multiple institutional logics coexist. This research
   investigates 20 co-leadership dyads in health care organizations to
   examine whether, when, and how co-leadership arrangements can enable the
   bridging of institutional logics. Empirical findings suggest that the
   potential for bridging through co-leadership arrangements is present,
   but that it may often be achieved through the assimilation of one side
   by the other rather than balanced integration of competing demands. We
   conclude that the challenge of collective leadership (and of
   co-leadership, in particular) may lie not only in developing smooth
   relations among multiple leaders and their followers, but also in
   maintaining and mobilizing the tensions that can make their
   collaboration most fruitful. We suggest that the collective leadership
   literature has often missed the significance of this central paradox:
   that collective leadership may be most needed where it is most difficult
   to achieve. When it seems to operate most smoothly, it is possible that
   it may not always be fulfilling its mission.},

Abstract = {We consider the emergence of design innovations in process, emerging
   around the form of polyarchy. This is done by using a case study of
   innovation conducted by a production organization's project that was
   embedded in and hosted by a bureaucratic public institution, the
   Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC). The research reported here
   was part of a larger project comparing the BBC and ABC's use of
   different modes of organization. It focused mainly on the organization
   designed to deliver a six-part television series, The Code. The
   innovative process of Scribe, the organization in question, in producing
   the story is a good example of idea work being instituted in a
   polyarchic design process. Scribe represents a new organizational design
   characterized by a polyarchic structure, which is soft and
   decentralized, with strict and relatively insuperable social and
   symbolic boundaries. This results in a project-based organization to
   coordinate collective innovation that is curated by making the writer
   also the creative director or showrunner. The research contributes
   further to exploring organizational idea work, through prioritizing
   creativity and innovation by an explicit positioning of a product and
   collaborative generative idea work.},

Title = {On the dynamics of failure in organizational change: A dialectical
   perspective},
Journal = {HUMAN RELATIONS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {74},
Number = {2, SI},
Pages = {234-257},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {How does failure emerge and develop during organizational change? As
   organizations are pushed for change, the notion of failure that relates
   to change becomes gradually ingrained in contemporary research. However,
   with studies having primarily added to the conversation from a static
   outset, extant scholarly work might not fully capture the transience
   that marks change in essence. This article contributes to the literature
   on failure in change by advancing a dialectical perspective, offering
   the scholarly community insight in the emergence and development of
   failure as happening in three processes. In a retentive process, change
   agents adhere to a change approach deemed successful in spite of
   alternatives emerging, causing tensions to gradually build within the
   organization's social atmosphere. In a reactive process, looming
   tensions find themselves affirmed and flare up, instigating the display
   of a new change approach that is antithetical to the one initially
   adhered to. Finally, in a recursive process, organizational members
   collectively recall the positive aspects of prior failure, smoothening
   organizational change towards re-combinatory synthesis. Marking
   failure's emergence and development as a dialectic, this article notes
   failure in organizational change to be as generative as it is
   deteriorating, paving the way for both success and failure to
   continuously remit.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we argue that antecedents of modern corporate social
   responsibility (CSR) prior to the Industrial Revolution can be referred
   to as ``proto-CSR{''} to describe a practice that influenced modern CSR,
   but which is different from its modern counterparts in form and
   structure. We develop our argument with the history of miners' guilds in
   medieval Germany-religious fraternities and secular mutual aid
   societies. Based on historical data collected by historians and
   archeologists, we reconstruct a long-term process of pragmatic
   experimentation with institutions of mutual aid that address social
   problems in the early mining industry, and thus before the rise of the
   modern state and the capitalist firm. Co-shaped by economic and
   political actors, these institutions of mutual aid have influenced the
   social responsibility programs of early industrialists, modern social
   welfare legislation, and contemporary CSR. We conjecture that other
   elements of proto-CSR might have evolved according to similar
   trajectories.},

Abstract = {In this essay I discuss two limitations that emerge when considering
   Tsoukas (J Bus Ethics 2018. 10.1007/s10551-018-3979-y) analysis of the
   Academy of Management's (AOM) initial response to the travel ban issued
   by President Trump in 2017. First, I suggest that any initial official
   response on the part of AOM would have required its leaders to ``speak
   on behalf of{''} all AOM members and thus would have created a number of
   problems. We therefore need to take better account of others'
   perspectives ({''}speaking with{''}) whenever speaking for others. For
   this reason I emphasize that moral imagination does not constitute a
   solely individual cognitive act but must be thought of as a deliberative
   process. Second, while Tsoukas' analysis suggests that the leadership of
   AOM should have made an exception to the rule on taking public stands, I
   show that such exceptions need to be justified communicatively,
   especially when dealing with moral questions. My analysis outlines the
   formal and informal communication processes necessary to facilitate such
   justification and explores ways in which AOM's current approach to
   deliberation can be improved.},

Title = {Remembering to Forget: The Historic Irresponsibility of US Big Tobacco},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ETHICS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {166},
Number = {2, SI},
Pages = {233-252},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Society increasingly demands corporations to be accountable for their
   past misbehaviours. Some corporations engage in forgetting work with the
   aim of avoiding responsibility for their wrongdoings. We argue that
   whenever social actors have their past actions called into question and
   engage in forgetting work, an ethics of remembering takes place. A
   collective project of social forgetting is contingent on the emergence
   of coordinated actions among players of an industry. Similarly,
   sustained efforts of forgetting work depend on the continuity of the
   project through various generations of employees, which presumes the
   existence of frameworks of remembering in place. We analysed this
   paradox through a historical case study of the U.S. tobacco industry. We
   conclude that forgetting work may be a double-edged sword. It might be
   beneficial in the short run, to the extent that corporations can
   successfully maintain the public ignorance about their deceitful pasts.
   In the long run, however, it creates additional layers of historical
   irresponsibility and may turn into a compounded liability in the event
   the memory of the collective strategy of social forgetting becomes
   public.},

Journal = {ORGANIZATION STUDIES},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {40},
Number = {11},
Pages = {1631-1656},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Structural sources of power have shifted dramatically in corporate
   America. Recently, the fracturing of the corporate interlock network
   threatens corporate managers' capacity to act as a unified group in
   support of their shared interests, potentially destroying managerialism
   and elevating shareholder power. Paradoxically, however, the fracturing
   of the corporate elite has not led to a widespread retreat of
   managerialism. Corporate managers have replaced their collective
   structural resources, embedded in their board interlock network, with
   organizational structural resources located within their firms. By
   adopting lone-insider board structures where the CEO is the only
   employee on the board of directors, CEOs establish brokerage positions
   within their focal firms, allowing them to preserve their autonomy even
   as the broader network withers. Firms nested in cohesive communities
   were the first to adopt lone-insider boards, supplementing and
   eventually replacing closure with brokerage as a structural resource.
   These alternative structural resources operated to preserve
   managerialism during different times. Network closure traditionally
   helped to preserve managerialism against shareholder pressure, but this
   effect disappeared as the network fragmented in the mid-2000s. In its
   absence, managers increasingly relied on organizational brokerage
   positions to maintain their autonomy. Consequently, managerialism
   remains surprisingly robust in the era of a fractured corporate board
   interlock network because top managers have become more focused on
   establishing positions of power within their own firms.},

Abstract = {Can platforms close the governance gap in the sharing economy, and if
   so, how? Through an in-depth qualitative case study, we analyze the
   process by which new regulation and self-regulation emerge in one sector
   of the sharing economy, crowdfunding, through the actions of a
   meta-organization. We focus on the principal French sectoral
   meta-organization, Financement Participatif France (FPF-Crowdfunding
   France). We show that this multi-stakeholder meta-organization not only
   closed the governance gap through collective legal, ethical, and
   utilitarian work but also preceded and shaped the new market. We present
   a hybrid governance approach combining (a) soft multi-agency regulation,
   (b) self-regulation through a process of ``partial meta-organizing{''},
   and (c) direct civil society participation. We expand the literature by
   highlighting features of platforms' partial meta-organizing and by
   identifying conditions for successful joint regulation and
   self-regulation of the sector.},

   what a marketer intends when offering promotions. The authors develop an
   understanding of how this unintended value is coproduced through the
   combined actions of users in deal collectives. Users are drawn to deal
   collectives by a web of motivations that include subversive shopper
   feelings, which reflect a desire to outsmart firms and temporarily upend
   the market power structure. Uncovered transvaluation processes show that
   deal forums-due to their collective knowledge, creativity, and trust-are
   more effective than individual consumers at identifying, developing, and
   vetting opportunities to capture unintended value. The authors further
   reveal that unintended value can stem from untargeted promotions,
   pricing and promotion errors, and combinations or stacking of
   promotions. Strategies for monitoring deal collectives and either
   discouraging or supporting their activities are offered.},

Title = {When does crowdsourcing benefit firm stock market performance?},
Journal = {RESEARCH POLICY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {48},
Number = {9},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Crowdsourcing is a particular form of open innovation (OI) that aims to
   boost idea-generation in innovation processes. The underlying rationale
   is that the collective intelligence of a large number of contributors
   outside the firm's boundaries increases the likelihood of achieving
   `extreme outcomes', L e., high quality ideas with exceptional business
   potential. Due to the idiosyncrasies that differentiate crowdsourcing
   from other forms of OI, the findings from prior research on the
   performance implications of OI cannot be directly extended to
   crowdsourcing. Similarly, the findings on the effect of internal R\&D on
   firm performance cannot be directly applied to crowdsourcing due to the
   greater uncertainty in dealing with a crowd of unknown individuals
   outside the organization whose ideas have to be evaluated and ultimately
   processed internally. Thus, while crowdsourcing research has recently
   burgeoned, it is ambiguous as to whether and when crowdsourcing is
   beneficial for firms. In fact, the overall effect of crowdsourcing on a
   firm's future profits has not been thoroughly investigated. To fill this
   gap, we conducted an event study analyzing stock market reactions to
   crowdsourcing announcements, a forward-looking market-based measure able
   to isolate the effect of crowdsourcing on a firm's future profits, which
   we refer to as firm stock market performance. Drawing on the
   resource-based view, we argue that an external crowd can become a
   valuable resource if the firm is able to extract value from it. Our
   findings show that two key contingency factors, Le., brand value and
   investment opportunities, determine the boundary conditions that enable
   firms to extract value from the crowd, resulting in a positive stock
   market reaction to the announcement of a crowdsourcing campaign. In
   addition to advancing scholarly knowledge on crowdsourcing, our results
   provide practitioners with relevant indications for profitable
   crowdsourcing campaigns.},

Title = {Multi-method evidence on investors' reactions to managers'
   self-inclusive language},
Journal = {ACCOUNTING ORGANIZATIONS AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {79},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {We investigate the joint effect of managers' self-inclusive language
   (SIL) and performance news on investors' reactions to accounting
   disclosures. We identify two types of SIL: individual SIL, which
   includes first-person singular pronouns (e.g., I, me) and collective
   SIL, which includes first-person plural pronouns (e.g., we, us). When
   performance news is negative, individual SIL implies that a manager is
   claiming sole responsibility for the unfavorable event whereas
   collective SIL and SEL diffuse responsibility. Therefore, we predict
   higher perceptions of manager credibility for individual SIL relative to
   collective SIL or self-exclusive language (SEL) when performance news is
   negative, which, in turn, increase investment judgments. We use a
   between-subjects experiment to test our predictions. Results show higher
   perceptions of manager credibility and higher investment judgments for
   individual SIL relative to collective SIL or SEL when performance news
   is negative. Results of a maximum likelihood estimation suggest that
   perceptions of manager credibility mediate the effect of individual SIL
   on investment judgments, supporting the notion that individual SIL
   exerts an indirect effect on investment judgments. We supplement
   experimental evidence with an analysis of managers' SIL in a large
   sample of earnings conference calls. We document a positive (negative)
   market reaction to individual (collective) SIL when performance news is
   negative, consistent with our Hypothesis. We also find a positive market
   reaction to individual SIL when news is positive. Overall, our study
   offers multi-method evidence of the impact of a subtle and easily
   overlooked component of managers' language on investors' judgments. (C)

Abstract = {Local supplier corporate social responsibility (CSR) in developing
   countries represents a powerful tool to improve labour conditions. This
   paper pursues an inter-organizational network approach to the global
   value chain (GVC) literature to understand the influence of suppliers'
   collective behaviour on their CSR engagement. This exploratory study of
   30 export-oriented and first-tier apparel suppliers in Bangladesh, a
   developing country, makes three relevant contributions to GVC
   scholarship. First, we show that suppliers are interlinked in a
   horizontal network that restricts unilateral CSR engagement. This is
   justified in that unilateral CSR engagement is a source of heterogeneity
   in labour practices; consequently, it triggers worker unrest. Second, we
   present and discuss an exploratory framework based on four scenarios of
   how suppliers currently engage in CSR given their network's pressure
   toward collective behaviour: unofficial CSR engagement, geographic
   isolation, size and competitive differentiation, and external pressure.
   Finally, we show the need to spread CSR homogeneously among suppliers
   and to reconceptualize the meaning of CSR in developing countries,
   encouraging more scrutiny toward horizontal dynamics.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {45},
Number = {8},
Pages = {3146-3177},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Self-regulation and learning are fundamentally dynamic phenomena that
   occur at the within-person level and unfold over time. However, the
   majority of the extant empirical research on self-regulated learning has
   been conducted at the between-person level, which can obscure the true
   nature of interrelationships among self-regulatory mechanisms. In the
   present study, we seek to advance a more nuanced view of the role of
   self-regulation in modern training and development by presenting a novel
   theoretical perspective that integrates cognitive, motivational, and
   behavioral mechanisms central to the literature on active learning with
   the more dynamic theoretical principles and mechanisms underlying
   stage-based cognitive models of skill acquisition. Hypotheses derived
   from this model were tested in a laboratory study with 305 participants
   who practiced a dynamic computer game involving strong cognitive and
   perceptual-motor demands. Bivariate cross-lagged latent growth models
   generally supported the proposed model, revealing systematic trends over
   the course of practice consistent with a series of iterative,
   bidirectional, and self-correcting reciprocal interrelationships among
   self-efficacy, metacognition, exploratory behavior, and practice
   performance. Collectively, these findings suggest that strong positive
   interrelationships among self-regulated learning variables at the
   between-person level may, in some cases, actually belie the true nature
   of their functional effects. Implications for theory and practice are
   discussed.},

   from the shared perception of we-ness that employees experience through
   both participatory practices. Our path analysis of a multisource,
   time-lagged dataset from 176 large U.S. companies revealed the
   sequential mediating roles of social cohesion and voluntary turnover
   between these organizational practices and labor productivity. Our
   theoretical claims and empirical evidence will contribute to a

Abstract = {This introductory, along with the eight articles contained within this
   Special Issue, highlights and brings greater clarity to
   entrant-incumbent interactions and to firm movement - when entrants
   traverse market territories for the creation and/or delivery of
   offerings, where `markets' include service or product categories,
   technology or resource spaces, industries, sectors and/or geographies.
   Collectively, this Special Issues explains that firm movement across
   market boundaries is highly consequential, influencing
   resource-capability mixes inside firms, interfirm relations, market
   logic and industry value chains, and of course, people, communities and
   even nations. Specifically, we develop a field-wide perspective of
   market entry by expanding on the framework of market entry that Zachary
   and his colleagues developed (Zachary et al., 2015) - i.e., the who
   (players such as incumbents, entrants, suppliers, etc.), when (the
   timing and sequence of entry), how (the strategy, resources,
   capabilities, etc.), where (the space of entry) and what (product,
   service, business model, etc.) - to include two additional categories:
   complements (networks, platforms, ecosystems) and non-market elements
   (government, political, social and cultural arrangements). We also
   summarize the eight highly diverse and insightful articles that make
   this Special Issue, and conclude with a discussion to highlight
   foundational questions that point to new directions in future research
   in this field. In sum, we hope to inspire scholars to go beyond counting
   outcomes (e.g., entry/exit rates, or profiling successful versus
   unsuccessful entrants), to consider contexts, processes and
   contingencies (e.g., cost, time, collaboration, competition, interfirm
   relations, etc.) and to discover boundary conditions that inform a
   theory of market entry.},

Title = {Money and the Commons: An Investigation of Complementary Currencies and
   Their Ethical Implications},

Abstract = {The commons is a concept increasingly used with the promise of creating
   new collective wealth. In the aftermath of the economic and financial
   crises, finance and money have been criticized and redesigned to serve
   the collective interest. In this article, we analyze three types of
   complementary currency (CC) systems: community currencies,
   inter-enterprise currencies, and cryptocurrencies. We investigate
   whether these systems can be considered as commons. To address this
   question, we use two main theoretical frameworks that are usually
   separate: the ``new commons{''} in organization studies and the ``common
   good{''} in business ethics. Our findings show that these monetary
   systems and organizations may be considered as commons under the
   ``common good{''} framework since they promote the common interest by
   creating new communities. Nevertheless, according to the ``new
   commons{''} framework, only systems relying on collective action and
   self-management can be said to form commons. This allows us to suggest
   two new categories of commons: the ``social commons,{''} which fit into
   both the ``new commons{''} and the ``common good{''} frameworks, and the
   ``commercial commons,{''} which fit the ``common good{''} but not the
   ``new commons{''} framework. This research advances a new
   conceptualization of the commons and of the ethical implications of CCs.},

Abstract = {Research linking broad-based employee stock ownership (BESO) with firm
   performance continues to receive considerable attention both in and
   outside the field of management. Despite the evidence being generally
   positive regarding the BESO-firm performance relationship, there has
   been a relative dearth of research providing insights into the
   circumstances surrounding the effectiveness of BESO. With this research
   gap in mind, we formulated and launched this special issue. This guest
   editor introduction begins with a look at the research on this topic,
   followed by a brief discussion of each article accepted for publication.
   We conclude by highlighting the major themes from the collective

Journal = {ORGANIZATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {30},
Number = {6},
Pages = {1189-1206},

Abstract = {Protest raises the visibility of a social movement, and this affects all
   organizations affiliated with the movement's group identity. Although
   the mutually beneficial relationship between protest and social movement
   organizations is well documented, we argue that protest does not
   necessarily aid other, more mundane types of affiliated organizations in
   the same manner. Specifically, we expect that increases in protest
   participation will favor the viability of organizations targeting an
   audience close to the group identity but not of organizations with an
   audience in which somemembers share that identity and others do not. We
   evaluate these claims using a data set of pro-lesbian, gay, bisexual,
   transgender, and queer (LGBTQ) protest events and local organizations in
   U.S. cities using a fixed-effects panel design with instrumental
   variables. Findings show that increases in protest participation
   decrease the presence of organizations that engage LGBTQ and non-LGBTQ
   audiences, especially local businesses that simultaneously bridge
   multiple groups of owners, customers, and clients.},

Title = {The state of innovation system research: What happens beneath the
   surface?},
Journal = {RESEARCH POLICY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {48},
Number = {9},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Since its emergence in the 1980s, the concept of ``Innovation
   Systems{''} (IS) has inspired research and shaped discussions in
   academia and policy alike, leading to a cascading development of
   approaches and extensions at various analytic levels. IS research has
   expanded far beyond its initial focus by generating new knowledge within
   but also attracting increased attention from adjacent fields. As a
   result, the broad understanding of IS and its diversity in applications
   has resulted in blurry boundaries of the field, making its contemporary
   delineation, synthesis, and assessment of its progress challenging.
   Using a combination of data-driven techniques from bibliometrics,
   natural language processing, and network analysis, this paper maps and
   analyzes the structure of knowledge production and the process of
   knowledge integration in current research. We find an overall growing
   tendency toward increasing diversity in the knowledge bases from which
   the field draws, accompanied by a decreasing coherence of collective
   research efforts. We point to the crucial role of institutions and
   academic entrepreneurs in shaping these developments in
   interdisciplinary and diverse fields, illustrating this by the role of
   the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).},

   Behavior},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ETHICS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {160},
Number = {1},
Pages = {151-166},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The article deals with the influence of organizational ethics program
   (EP) components on managerial ethical behavior. The main aim was to
   establish which EP components are perceived as valuable and useful to
   foster the ethical behavior of managers. Moreover, we also aimed to
   investigate the role of ethics training in this context and to explore
   whether it can potentially increase managers' trust in EP components as
   effective tools for the promotion of ethical behavior. The article
   advances the EP theory in several ways. It offers novel insights into
   both business ethics and EP development in the specific cultural and
   social circumstances of a former socialist country in the Central and
   Eastern European region, Slovakia. It shows that codes of ethics and
   related reporting and control mechanisms are perceived as the most
   effective EP components to shape managerial ethical behavior.
   Furthermore, based on empirical evidence, and to some extent contrary to
   prior theory, the article unveils three EP functions, namely the
   `compliance with group norms,' the `ethics education through collective
   discussion,' and the `counselling and resolving of ethical issues' at
   workplace. In addition, the article shows that ethics trainings can help
   to boost the trust of managers toward EP components and might be
   conceptualized as a precursor for an effectively functioning EP.},

Abstract = {Stigmatized markets are those where either the products/services, or the
   consumers, or both, have been collectively, negatively stereotyped and
   devalued by one or more stakeholder audiences in ways that discredit the
   overall market. Many stigmatized markets exist, and many flourish, yet
   little systematic attention has focused on entry into such markets. Our
   article addresses this gap by conceptualizing various strategies for
   entering stigmatized markets. We further present propositions regarding
   the market-level factors that can influence which of these strategies
   firms will choose to employ. The contributions include: conceptually
   clarifying the nature of stigmatized markets; identifying additional
   types of entry strategies relevant for entering stigmatized markets;
   theorizing the conditions under which firms would choose one entry
   strategy over another; and opening up for consideration the effects that
   market entry may have on stigmatized actors in targeted markets.},

   actors live out paradoxes through enacting power relations. Based on our
   analysis, we elaborate a theoretical framework that conceptualizes (1)
   individual, role-based responses to paradox through which actors
   construct positions of control and resistance; (2) collective responses
   to paradox through which organizational members enact these power
   positions; and (3) the macro-level effects of such dynamics. Our
   findings demonstrate how micro-level power struggles keep paradoxical
   tensions in play. Furthermore, our study shows how, ironically, such
   struggles participate in the macro-level reproduction of the status quo.},

   what can you, as an individual leader, do to ensure that your team is
   including and making the most of diverse voices? How can one person fix
   what an entire organization can't?
   Although bias itself is devilishly hard to change, it is not as
   difficult to interrupt. The authors have identified several practices
   that managers can use to counter bias (and avoid its negative effects)
   without spending a lot of time or political capital. In hiring, leaders
   should insist on a diverse pool, precommit to objective criteria, limit
   referral hiring, and structure interviews around skills-based questions.
   Day to day, they should ensure that high- and low-value work is assigned
   evenly and run meetings in a way that guarantees all voices are heard.
   In evaluating and developing people, they should clarify criteria for
   positive reviews and promotions, stick to those rules, and separate
   potential from performance and personality from skill sets.},

Abstract = {We analyze paradoxes embedded in long-term corporate development and
   conceptualize a new leadership approach: paradoxical leader behavior in
   long-term corporate development (PLB-CD). Paradoxical leader behaviors
   are characterized as seemingly both competing and interrelated. We posit
   that paradoxical leaders employ such behaviors to meet competing demands
   simultaneously and over time in the process of (a) maintaining both
   short-term efficiency and long-term development, (b) maintaining both
   organizational stability and flexibility, (d) focusing on both
   shareholders and stakeholder communities, and (d) conforming to and
   shaping collective forces in the environment. We conduct two studies
   with multiple samples to develop a measurement of PLB-CD. Our results
   demonstrate that long-term orientation is positively associated with
   paradoxical leader behavior, which in turn positively affects the
   increase of R\&D investment, market share, and corporate reputation.},

Abstract = {Many organizations aim to increase the representation of women in their
   workforce, yet such efforts are often challenged by women's relatively
   higher propensity to leave a job compared to men. Overlooked so far has
   been the temporal relationship between the representation of women and
   an organization's collective employee turnover. We suggest that a
   substantive and rapid increase in the representation of women positively
   affects women and results in positive spillover effects for men, leading
   to a decrease in collective turnover. In our theoretical development, we
   explain how higher representation of women is associated with higher job
   embeddedness for all employees, which results in a subsequent decrease
   in collective employee turnover. We use latent curve model (LCM)
   analysis to examine a population of 499 organizations over a 14-year
   time span, and find support for our hypotheses. We suggest opportunities
   for future research and offer implications for practicing managers.},

Abstract = {This study examines the maintenance of highly institutionalized
   practices during periods of vehement contestation and changing external
   demands. Employing a cross-level longitudinal research design, we
   explore how the recruitment model of elite French business schools
   persisted, remaining fundamentally intact despite serious questions
   raised about its functional utility and social legitimacy. Comparing
   three periods of contestation, we document shifting coalitions of
   dispersed actors that were incentivized to ``thematically{''} maintain
   the practices in the focal field with little formal orchestration. Our
   findings indicate that practices which contribute to social
   stratification often foster meta-routines that cajole constituencies in
   multiple fields to, collectively and self-interestedly, promote and
   regulate conservative change. We identify three
   meta-routines-referential comparison, generative improvisation, and
   distributed monitoring and policing-that introduced flexibility and
   encouraged ``unforced{''} adaptations. In elaborating these
   meta-routines, we contribute to extant theory on the mechanisms of
   institutional maintenance, and shed further light on the role of complex
   embeddedness as a constraint on institutional processes.},

Abstract = {How does the multiplicity of surveilling gazes affect the experience of
   employees subjected to a matrix of domination in organisations? Building
   on a case study of ultra-religious Jewish women in Israeli high-tech
   organisations, the article demonstrates how the intersectionality of
   gender and religiosity exposed them to a matrix of contradicting
   visibility regimes - managerial, peers, and religious community. By
   displaying their compliance with each visibility regime, they were
   constructed as hyper-subjugated employees, but simultaneously were able
   to use (in)visibility as a resource. Specifically, by manoeuvring
   between the various gazes and playing one visibility regime against the
   other, they challenged some of the organisational and religious norms
   that served to marginalise them, yet upheld their status as worthy
   members of both institutions. Juxtaposing theoretical insights from
   organisational surveillance and gender studies, the article reveals the
   role of multiple surveilling gazes in both the reproduction of
   minorities' marginalisation, and their ability to mobilise it to
   maintain their collective identities.},

Title = {The Role of Firm Size and Knowledge Intensity in the Performance Effects

Journal = {JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {47},

Abstract = {As employees are among firms' most important resources and labor markets
   are facing serious labor shortages, firm-level collective turnover is
   one of the most important challenges facing organizations.
   Context-emergent turnover theory provides a theoretical framework for
   the performance implications of collective turnover and argues that
   context, and in particular, firm size, plays a crucial role in the
   collective turnover-performance relationship. Yet, the moderating role
   of firm size remains undertheorized, empirically understudied, and thus,
   unclear. Based on the resource-based view of the firm, we develop a
   theoretical framework for two competing perspectives (a negative and a
   positive one) on the role of firm size and put forward the firm's
   knowledge intensity as a crucial additional moderator. The main premise
   is that whereas firm size determines what resources firms have to
   successfully cope with turnover, knowledge intensity determines the
   resources firms need to do so. We propose a three-way interaction,
   suggesting that firm size reinforces the harmful effect of turnover in
   highly knowledge-intensive firms and buffers it in firms with low levels
   of knowledge intensity. Using a unique multi-industry and longitudinal
   administrative data set of 6,913 Belgian firms (2012-2016), we find
   support for these assumptions. This study highlights the importance of
   the context in which firms have to deal with turnover, and it spurs
   researchers to go beyond studying turnover in narrow study contexts, to
   take into account the interplay among different but intertwined
   organizational contingencies, and to acknowledge both the quantitative
   (how many employees leave) and qualitative components (who leaves) of
   turnover.},

Year = {2021},
Volume = {170},
Number = {1},
Pages = {53-74},

Abstract = {Environmental pollution has become a serious challenge in emerging
   markets. Using a unique survey of privately owned enterprises in China,
   this paper investigates how polluting firms respond to institutional
   pressures. We find that polluting firms conform to external pressures by
   combining relational activities and clean technology investments.
   However, some polluting firms alleviate regulative pressures by bribing
   government officials, which represents an unethical relational strategy
   to manage political relationship. We further analyze the contingency on
   firm-level political connection and local institutional conditions.
   Political connection buffers firms from institutional demand and
   demotivates firms' willingness to respond to institutional pressures;
   stronger local civic activism and better bureaucratic governance curb
   the pollution-driven bribery, but they are not strong enough to enhance
   environmentally friendly practices. Collectively, our study demonstrates
   how polluting firms navigate institutional pressures in emerging
   markets, and it particularly highlights the pollution-driven bribery as
   an obstacle to sustainability.},

Title = {Examining Anger's Immobilizing Effect on Institutional Insiders' Action
   Intentions in Social Movements},
Journal = {ADMINISTRATIVE SCIENCE QUARTERLY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {65},
Number = {4},
Pages = {847-886},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {We theorize that anger incited by a social movement, which has a
   mobilizing effect among outsider activists, might immobilize collective
   action intentions for institutional insiders-those sympathetic to the
   movement and employed by its target. We conducted initial field surveys
   across a spectrum of social movements, including Occupy Wall Street and
   \#metoo, as well as those related to business sustainability and gun
   control, which showed that institutional insiders are often just as
   angry as outsider activists. But the evidence from those surveys did not
   show that social movement anger translated into collective action
   intentions among institutional insiders. We tested our theory
   deductively with an experiment conducted with participants who were
   supportive of social movement issues in their organizations. Overall,
   our results show that anger about a social movement issue relates to
   greater collective action intentions among outsider activists but not
   among institutional insiders. Instead of anger emboldening institutional
   insiders to act despite the potential costs, anger triggers fear about
   the potential negative consequences of collective action in the
   workplace, which in turn results in withdrawal. While social movements
   often rely on anger frames to mobilize sympathizers, our work suggests
   that this practice may paradoxically cause fear that immobilizes those
   uniquely positioned to be able to influence organizations to change.},

Abstract = {This study examined the identity work processes of severely disabled
   soldiers who faced discontinuous and involuntary career transitions. As
   these individuals engaged in rehabilitation and vocational training at a
   military-affiliated facility, their identity transitions were not marked
   by deletions of past identity elements or reference groups. Instead,
   their transitions involved collectively and contextually edited
   imaginations of the future that allowed for continuity of their
   foundational self-narratives. The findings extend past research by
   identifying why the forging of continuity is generative during certain
   identity transitions. The findings also show that when similar others
   contribute to the script of one's identity narrative within a familiar
   liminal context, maintaining a semblance of the status quo is construed
   as change.},

Abstract = {Participatory organizational interventions are a recommended approach to
   improve the psychosocial work environment. As interventions of this type
   are shaped by employees and managers, their implementation can vary
   considerably, making evaluation challenging. This study contributes to
   our understanding of interventions by focusing on how the intervention
   mechanisms and the organizational context interact. In a mixed-methods
   design, we use multi-group structural equation modelling of pre-and
   post-intervention survey data (N = 204) to test multiple mediational
   mechanisms in three different contexts. We then analyse interviews (N =
   67) and field observations of workshops to identify the role of
   contextual factors. The findings suggest that participatory
   organizational interventions do not produce one-size-fits-all results;
   on the contrary, intervention results are better understood as products
   of multiple intervention mechanisms interacting with the specific
   organizational contexts.},

Journal = {HUMAN RELATIONS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {73},

Abstract = {How is it that some organizational practices flow like clockwork and may
   even energize us but others seem to be stuck in the mud and diminish our
   capacity to act? In order to understand this, we develop a concept of
   affecto-rhythmic order that captures how rhythms and affects interrelate
   in the flow of organizational practices. Adopting a sociomaterial
   practice perspective, our ethnographic study of a Nordic startup
   accelerator demonstrates how participants learn and embody a contextual
   affecto-rhythmic upbeat order and how this enhances their individual and
   collective capacity to engage with the fast-paced development of
   business ideas and sales pitching skills relevant in the accelerator
   setting. As a contribution, the study theorizes and empirically
   illustrates the entangled nature of rhythms and affects in
   organizational practices, provides novel insights into inter-corporeal
   learning and the regulative nature of practices, and shows how affective
   ethnography can help scholars examine affect and write about it in
   organizational research.},

Abstract = {Based on social cognitive theory, we theorize that collective efficacy
   plays a mediating role in the relationship between paternalistic
   leadership and organizational commitment and that this mediating role
   depends on team cohesion. The empirical results from a study of 238
   employees from 52 teams at manufacturing companies show that benevolent
   leadership and moral leadership, both components of paternalistic
   leadership, are positively related to organizational commitment and
   further that collective efficacy mediates the moral
   leadership-organizational commitment relationship. We did not find a
   relationship between authoritarian leadership and organizational
   commitment. Besides, it was found that team cohesion negatively
   moderates the relationship between moral leadership and collective
   efficacy and positively moderates the relationship between collective
   efficacy and organizational commitment. Explanations and directions for
   future research are discussed.},

Abstract = {A number of leadership theories have highlighted the positive impact
   that a leader's vision can have on follower outcomes. Although
   significant research has examined the impact of vision, our
   understanding of the mechanisms underlying this relationship is
   incomplete. Here, we use self-concept-based theory (Shamir et al., 1993)
   to explore how the strength of the vision being propounded and the way
   that it is expressed by leaders influence collective work beliefs. Using
   a matched sample of teachers and principals, we observe that
   inspirational visions are positively associated with group affective
   tone and that future-oriented visions are positively associated with
   collective efficacy and group affective tone, with all relationships
   mediated by visioning behaviour. Thus, employees whose leaders exhibit
   strong visions feel more collectively capable (higher levels of
   collective efficacy) and happier (higher levels of group affective tone)
   than employees whose leaders exhibit weak visions, especially when
   messages are delivered in an emotionally positive way. We conclude that
   visions contain distinct vision strength themes that differ in terms of
   their motivating capacity and offer important practical implications and
   suggestions for future research.},

Abstract = {This study offers a theory-generating examination of the social
   construction processes through which members regularly exposed to
   psychological distress navigate paradoxical demands to both extend and
   protect the self in their work with others. A qualitative study of a
   child welfare agency found that members organized themselves to avoid
   the conscious experience of psychological distress. Distress organizing
   involved, first, the use of collective avoidance mechanisms that
   constrained the time, space, and impetus for members to experience the
   distress of their work; and, second, patterns of interpersonal avoidance
   that prevented relationships in which such experiencing could occur. The
   mutually reinforcing, cumulative effect of distress organizing sharply
   reduced members' emotional availability to clients and coworkers, which
   manifested as largely dispassionate responses to others' distress.
   Dispassionate responding led to emotional isolation and emotional
   exhaustion, with which members coped by further avoidance of others.
   Distress organizing thus amplified rather than ameliorated distress.
   Amplification processes were temporarily suspended when agency members
   momentarily created conditions for providing and receiving compassion.
   These findings contribute to theory about social contexts of
   psychological distress in organizations, the alleviation of such
   distress, and the bases of organizing processes.},

Abstract = {This paper studies the role of institutional investors in influencing
   corporate environmental, social, and governance (ESG) policies by
   analyzing the relation between institutional ownership and toxic release
   from facilities to which institutions are geographically proximate. We
   develop a local preference hypothesis based on the delegated
   philanthropy and transaction-costs theories. Consistent with the
   hypothesis, local institutional ownership is negatively related to
   facility toxic release. The negative relation is stronger for local
   socially responsible investing (SRI) funds, local public pension funds,
   and local dedicated institutions. We also find that the relation is more
   negative in communities that prefer more stringent environmental
   policies and in communities of greater collective cohesiveness. Local
   institutional ownership, particularly local ownerships by SRI funds and
   public pension funds, is positively related to the probability that an
   ESG proposal is either introduced or withdrawn. The paper sheds light on
   the drivers behind institutions' ESG engagement and their effectiveness
   in influencing ESG.},

Abstract = {In this article, we analyse the dynamics of intra-household allocations
   using unique panel data on individual-specific consumption expenditures
   and time used for leisure, market production, and home production.
   Cross-sectional differences at the time of marriage in expected wage
   profiles between a husband and wife strongly affect the allocation of
   private consumption expenditures and time use by households in the cross
   section. There are substantial gender asymmetries in these allocations.
   Even for households where the husband and wife have identical wages, the
   private consumption expenditures for the wife are about half those for
   the husband. Within a given household over time, shocks to wages lead
   households to shift the relative weights in favour of the spouse
   receiving the favourable shock. Additionally, we find that households
   adjust the weights in response to large but not to small shocks; the
   adjustment to the weights is twice as large in the year leading up to a
   divorce; and adjustments are more frequent in dual- than in
   single-earner households. We interpret the data using a dynamic
   collective model of the household with potentially limited commitment.},

Abstract = {The emergence and scope of personal and collective efforts to integrate
   faith into workplaces is a social movement that includes and extends
   beyond personal ethics. This paper discusses the development of The
   Integration Profile (TIP) Faith and Work Integration Scale, which is
   designed to measure the multidimensional nature of faith expressions
   within workplace settings. TIP measures the manifestations of faith,
   religion, and spirituality at the individual level. Earlier research
   theorized that individuals tend to manifest or live out their faith in
   one of four ways (Miller in God at work: the history and promise of the
   faith at work movement, Oxford University Press, New York, 2007); TIP
   expands this to assess eight sub-orientations, nested within the four
   main manifestations of faith-work integration. The development of the
   24-item TIP scale involved exploratory analyses in a sample of 512
   employees of a for-profit palliative care organization and a
   hierarchical confirmatory factor analysis in a sample of 4463 employees
   in an American multinational food processing organization. Additional
   analyses were conducted in a third sample of 266 working adults to
   assess the convergent and discriminant validity of the eight
   sub-orientations with other faith variables as well as associations with
   work outcomes.},

Abstract = {Social entrepreneurship increasingly involves collective, voluntary
   organizing efforts where success depends on generating and sustaining
   members' participation. To investigate how such participatory social
   ventures achieve member engagement in pluralistic institutional
   settings, we conducted a qualitative, inductive study of German
   Renewable Energy Source Cooperatives (RESCoops). Our findings show how
   value tensions emerge from differences in RESCoop members' relative
   prioritization of community, environmental, and commercial logics, and
   how cooperative leaders manage these tensions and sustain member
   participation through temporal, structural, and collaborative compromise
   strategies. We unpack the mechanisms by which each strategy enables
   members to justify organizational decisions that violate their personal
   value priorities and demonstrate their varying implications for
   organizational growth. Our findings contribute new insights into the
   challenges of collective social entrepreneurship, the capacity of hybrid
   organizing strategies to mitigate value concessions, and the importance
   of logic combinability as a key dimension of pluralistic institutional
   settings.},

Abstract = {Existing theory describes how family firms utilize a unique
   socioemotional reference point to frame strategic decision making, but
   scholars have not fully considered family-level strategy or changes in
   reference points. We theorize that as business-owning families are
   socialized with actors who provide new information, their collective
   knowledge structures are altered and, thus, the nature of reference
   points used in strategic decision making is impacted. Specifically, we
   link the socialization of next-generation family members to the temporal
   focus of reference points (i.e., backward or forward looking) and
   socialization into the capitalist class to the spatial focus of
   reference points (i.e., internally or externally oriented). Further, we
   theorize that the use of nonfamily professional advisors accelerates
   reference point shift. Our theory reveals the decisive role of social
   capital in reference point change and sheds light on how business-owning
   families may break free from old strategic frames. In doing so our
   framework provides a route to explore the sociocognitive processes
   underlying reference points' development and use, as well as sensemaking
   and interpretation more generally.},

   uncover the processes and practices through which organizational members
   systematically engage with history, we investigate uses of material
   memory in four corporate museums. Our analysis uncovers three distinct
   modes of engagement, reflecting different temporal perspectives on
   organizational identity, involving different cross-temporal

   theoretical insights have significant implications not only for
   understanding the use of history in organizations, but also for research
   on organizational identity and organizational memory.},

Journal = {RESEARCH POLICY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {48},
Number = {8, SI},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Organizations build strategic alliances with other firms with the intent
   of tapping into partners' resources and capturing long-term value from
   these relationships. Such partnerships are typically governed by
   contractual or equity arrangements with clear mutual obligations. More
   recently, however, organizations have begun to seek strategic
   partnerships with open innovation communities, which are novel digitally
   enabled forms of organizing, and where contractual commitments are not
   possible. Thus, selecting the right open innovation community as an
   alliance partner becomes a more complex decision. We follow how the
   organizational decision makers, in two technology firms that were
   pioneers of forming strategic alliances with open innovation
   communities, developed metrics around making such decisions. We build
   upon Shah and Swaminathan's (2008) contingency model of alliance partner
   selection and consider how it applies to the case of partnering with
   open innovation communities. This framework was useful in to frame our
   findings, yet our work recognizes and builds upon two key differences:
   1) the evaluation metrics used in selecting an open innovation community
   were more focused on value creation than value capture; and 2) open
   ecosystem considerations, and not just partner-specific metrics,
   featured prominently in this type of alliance partner evaluation. We
   develop the notions of community and ecosystem health to refer to these
   new metrics.},

Year = {2019},
Volume = {48},
Number = {8, SI},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Digital-technology usage in dynamic and complex work practices is a core
   phenomenon in innovation research. There are, however, few detailed
   analyses of how people organize the use of digital tools in their work
   practices. We aim to offer more insight into how individual actors use
   digital technology, how these actors organize its use in collectives,
   and how they organize their work with that of other actors in order to
   realize collective-level goals. We implemented a qualitative research
   design, based on interviews in architectural firms complemented with
   observations and archival data. By analyzing interactions of multiple
   individual actors with digital technology, we found that actors organize
   usage in collectives through activities that we call configuring-in-use
   and reflecting; and that they combine these two organizational
   activities in order to realize collective-level goals. We identify the
   combination of these organizational activities as configurational usage.
   We contribute to literature on the usage of pervasive digital technology
   by providing a detailed empirical investigation of organized usage of
   digital technology. Furthermore, we refine the conceptualization of
   configurational usage, improving understanding of core processes of
   digital innovation.},

Abstract = {Combining insights from the sociology of markets and studies of
   consultants, this article examines the tool-based practices by which
   market actors enable the agencing of the supply and demand of the market
   in ways that shape the market's trajectory. Building on 31 interviews
   and a rich set of secondary data, we provide an analysis of the
   development of a market for consultancy products and services for
   corporate social responsibility (CSR) in the province of Quebec
   (Canada). Through analytical induction we identified six tool-based
   practices by which consultants contributed to the agencing of the
   market, and our results show how these practices collectively created
   market shifts. Our analysis offers new insights into the processes by
   which consultants' tool-based practices produce market shifts, embed
   environmental and social concerns within market mechanisms, and
   `vascularize' markets.},

Title = {Content, Contribution, and Knowledge Consumption: Uncovering Hidden
   Topic Structure and Rhetorical Signals in Scientific Texts},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT},

Pages = {3035-3076},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Knowledge production and scientific discourse are observable in
   published scholarly texts. Citations capture knowledge consumption and
   impact. Drawing from the sociology of science, our theoretical framework
   posits scientific communities as thought collectives with distinctive
   thought styles that embed a hidden topic structure and rhetorical
   signals into a journal's published articles. We hypothesize and uncover
   how an article's topic attributes (structure, focus, and newness) and
   rhetorical attributes (inclusiveness, exclusiveness, tentativeness, and
   certainty) are related to future knowledge consumption. We empirically
   test our ideas by applying text mining algorithms to model topics and
   extract rhetorical signals from 1,646 strategy articles composed of
   nearly 18 million words generating 172,237 citations over 35 years. We
   find that strategy articles' hidden topic structure explains 14\% of
   variance in scientific impact. We also show that topic focus and topic
   newness each independently, directly, and significantly increase impact.
   As for newness, the first two articles published on a new topic each
   generate a citation premium >100\%, which is higher within the focal
   thought collective than outside. Importantly, we find that the citation
   premium of newness increases with greater topic focus (which attracts
   attention) and greater inflow of prior intracollective knowledge (which
   enhances absorption). Impact also increases when authors present new
   topics using a rhetorical style that is more tentative than certain.
   Overall, our findings demonstrate that topic and rhetorical attributes,
   as constitutive elements of scientific content, are independently and
   interdependently related to the consumption of strategy articles across
   thought collectives in management research.},

Title = {Mapping Espoused Organizational Values},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ETHICS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {159},
Number = {1},
Pages = {133-148},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {This paper develops an inventory and conceptual map of espoused
   organizational values. We suggest that espoused values are fundamentally
   different to other value forms as they are collective value statements
   that need to coexist as a basis for organizational activity and
   performance. The inventory is built from an analysis of 3112 value items
   espoused by 554 organizations in the UK and USA in both profit and
   not-for-profit sectors. We distil these value items into 85 espoused
   value labels, and these are assessed in terms of their similarity and
   difference through judgements made by 53 experienced individuals. The
   resulting conceptual map facilitates the evaluation of values which are
   espoused at the organizational level, as opposed to aggregations of
   personal values, an important distinction that is often ignored in the
   literature. This analysis identifies a number of distinct areas of
   emphasis occupied by espoused values. In particular, the richness of
   value labels that relates to broader ethical issues may be aimed at
   external stakeholder management, but also may have an increasing
   influence on organizational behaviour as they are embedded into
   organizational practices. By advancing our understanding of espoused
   values, through an analysis of those being used in practice, we provide
   a means by which future research into organizational values and ethical
   issues can progress.},

Title = {A hidden risk of auditor industry specialization: evidence from the
   financial crisis},
Journal = {REVIEW OF ACCOUNTING STUDIES},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {24},
Number = {3},
Pages = {891-926},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {We identify situations in which auditor industry specialization could be
   detrimental for audit outcomes. We predict that during periods of
   heightened industry-specific risk, specialist auditors from the affected
   industry could struggle to secure and allocate sufficient resources to
   mitigate the heightened risk because they have client portfolios
   concentrated in the affected industry. Using a measure of office-level
   industry concentration/specialization (as opposed to a market-based
   measure), we find that banking auditor industry specialization is
   associated with higher audit quality and more timely audits during the
   period before the financial crisis. However, during the financial
   crisis, banking industry specialization is associated with lower audit
   quality and less timely audits. Collectively, our results suggest that
   auditor industry specialization can be detrimental in certain
   circumstances and that audit firms and audit regulators should consider
   whether the audit markets have become too specialized to handle the
   resource allocation problems that crisis situations present.},

Title = {Driving down memory lane: The influence of memories in a community

Journal = {ORGANIZATION STUDIES},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {40},
Number = {9},
Pages = {1307-1329},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {In this paper, we explain how defunct organizations influence the
   communities they leave behind through ongoing processes of communal
   memory work, a twofold social process through which members of
   collectives develop shared memories of a defunct organization and
   behaviorally engage with its mnemonic traces. We explore how
   individuals' shared construal of their environment shapes their
   emotional orientation towards their past, which in turn gives rise to
   particular forms of memory work. We further show how communal memory
   work influences changes in an organization's role in a community's
   identity and members' construal of their environment. We develop our
   theory through an analysis of a case study of South Bend, Indiana, in
   the 54 years following the closure of the Studebaker Corporation's
   automotive factory in 1963. We close by discussing the implications of
   this work for memory scholarship.},

Abstract = {We examine how an investor collective action organization (ICAO)

   form of engagement-private meetings with independent directors to
   discuss governance proposals. Compared with a single investor acting
   alone, the ICAO has stronger incentives to engage in activism. Its
   dollar holdings and voting power are six times larger and predict direct
   access to the board and the firms it engages. Firms engaged by the ICAO
   are at least 58\% more likely than non-engaged firms to adopt the ICAO's
   governance proposals that include adoption of majority voting,
   say-on-pay, and specific compensation policies. Engaged firms also
   increase CEO incentive pay. An event study around the announcement of
   the ICAO's formation shows a positive impact on value that increases in
   both dollar holdings and voting power. We conclude that institutional

Journal = {JOURNAL OF MARKETING},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {83},
Number = {5},
Pages = {5-27},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The last decade has seen the emergence of the sharing economy as well as
   the rise of a diverse array of research on this topic both inside and
   outside the marketing discipline. However, the sharing economy's
   implications for marketing thought and practice remain unclear. This
   article defines the sharing economy as a technologically enabled
   socioeconomic system with five key characteristics (i.e., temporary
   access, transfer of economic value, platform mediation, expanded
   consumer role, and crowdsourced supply). It also examines the sharing
   economy's impact on marketing's traditional beliefs and practices in
   terms of how it challenges three key foundations of marketing:
   institutions (e.g., consumers, firms and channels, regulators),
   processes (e.g., innovation, branding, customer experience, value
   appropriation), and value creation (e.g., value for consumers, value for
   firms, value for society) and offers future research directions designed
   to push the boundaries of marketing thought. The article concludes with
   a set of forward-looking guideposts that highlight the implications of
   the sharing economy's paradoxes, maturation, and technological
   development for marketing research. Collectively, this article aims to
   help marketing scholars not only keep pace with the sharing economy but
   also shape its future direction.},

Title = {Explaining Stakeholder Identification with Moderate Prestige
   Collectives: A Study of NASCAR Fans},

Abstract = {Through two studies of fans who identified with the collective known as
   NASCAR (the National Association for Stock Car Auto Racing hereafter
   referred to as Nascar), we examine why stakeholders identify with
   collectives that are perceived as only moderately prestigious (given
   that high prestige has been shown, empirically, to be the primary
   predictor of collective identification because it enhances identifiers'
   self-esteem). Our findings indicate that identifiers did not perceive
   Nascar to be high in prestige (compared to other similar collectives)
   and that their identification was predicted, primarily, by ``Perceived
   Opportunity for Authentic Self-Expression{''} with Nascar. In addition,
   across both studies, we found that ``patriotism{''}-a personal value
   that was difficult for fans to affirm elsewhere-was the most important
   value that fans perceived they could ``self-express{''} when interacting
   with Nascar. These findings suggest that individuals may identify with
   moderate prestige collectives because they provide rare opportunities to
   express values that are part of their authentic selves, and thus,
   satisfy these individuals' ``needs for authenticity.{''}},

Abstract = {Although the emergence of new industries is often attributed to state
   support, little is known about the conditions under which an emergent
   category of organizations comes to receive state support in the first
   place. We theorize how government support for a nascent industry is
   jointly determined by the industry's internal features and external
   forces and test our arguments by analyzing feed-in tariff policies for
   the emergent solar photovoltaics (PV) industry in 28 European countries
   from 1987 to 2012. We find that feed-in tariffs-policies that
   incentivize renewable energy-were more likely in countries with greater
   numbers of solar PV producers and where the industry was more coherent,
   containing fewer producers coming from industries with a contrasting
   identity, such as fossil fuels. Further, we find that the concentration
   of the incumbent (rival) energy sector in a given country enhances the
   effect of the number of PV producers on government policy support, but
   only when the emerging industry has a coherent identity. Our results
   shed new light on the relationship between public policy and the
   emergence of an industry category, and they extend our understanding of
   how new industries can attain valuable state support while operating in
   seemingly hostile environments.},

Abstract = {This study investigates what happens when a prominent leader explicitly
   reaffirms the taken-for-granted assumptions underlying an institution.
   While such efforts are usually made to reinforce the institution, I
   theorize that they actually destabilize the institution and create
   collective uncertainty by reopening the very considerations that people
   take for granted. Using speeches made by the chair of the United States
   Federal Reserve from 1998 to 2014, I demonstrate that reaffirming the
   taken-for-granted assumptions underlying the monetary policy framework
   creates uncertainty in the broader financial market. This market
   reaction is also influenced by emotions present at the time of the
   speech that shape how the event is interpreted. Speeches conveyed in an
   overall more positive tone suppress this reaction, while more fear in
   the business media amplifies it. Moreover, supplementary analyses
   conducted on speeches during the financial crisis suggest that when the
   taken-for-grantedness of these assumptions has weakened, reaffirming
   them no longer creates uncertainty to the same extent. This study
   expands our understanding of the consequences of communication in market
   contexts, raises important questions about the trade-offs between public
   transparency and market stability, and contributes new insights to
   research on the cognitive and emotional microfoundations of
   institutions.},

Journal = {MANAGEMENT SCIENCE},

Volume = {65},

Abstract = {Emergency care necessitates adequate and timely treatment, which has
   unfortunately been compromised by crowding in many emergency departments
   (EDs). To address this issue, we study patient scheduling in EDs so that
   mandatory targets imposed on each patient's door-to-provider time and
   length of stay can be collectively met with the largest probability.
   Exploiting patient flow data from the ED, we propose a hybrid
   robustst-ochastic approach to formulating the patient scheduling
   problem, which allows for practical features, such as a time-varying
   patient arrival process, general consultation time distributions, and
   multiple heterogeneous physicians. In contrast to the conventional
   formulation of maximizing the joint probability of target attainment,
   which is computationally excruciating, the hybrid approach provides a
   computationally amiable formulation that yields satisfactory solutions
   to the patient scheduling problem. This formulation enables us to
   develop a dynamic scheduling algorithm for making recommendations about
   the next patient to be seen by each available physician. In numerical
   experiments, the proposed hybrid approach outperforms both the sample
   average approximation method and an asymptotically optimal scheduling
   policy.},

Abstract = {Research on the effects of HR management on employees' psychological

   Building on signaling theory and conservation of resources theory, our

   resource management (HHRM), employees' collective well-being (in terms
   of collective emotional exhaustion and collective engagement) and
   organizational performance. Results from a multi-source field study of
   top management team members, HR representatives, and 15,952 employees in
   88 organizations reveal a positive indirect relationship between HHRM
   and employees' collective well-being, which is mediated by employees'
   positive stress mindset. In addition, we find this positive indirect
   association to depend on the level of transformational leadership
   climate in organizations. Finally, our findings also show a positive
   indirect relationship between HHRM and company performance, mediated by

Abstract = {This research examines how investment experience and financial literacy

   documenting investors' demographic characteristics and financial
   literacy using a relatively large sample of participants (n > 2,000)
   recruited from Amazon's Mechanical Turk under different categories of
   investment experience, which I benchmark against national samples of
   financial capability skills in the United States. I then replicate a
   sample of three accounting research experiments, varying the type and
   depth of the underlying accounting issue. Across the three experiments,
   the data show two main results: First, investment experience strengthens
   the influence of financial accounting disclosures on participants'
   investment-related judgments. Second, financial literacy further
   strengthens the influence of financial accounting disclosures on
   investors' (but not noninvestors') judgments. Collectively, these
   findings suggest that investment experience and financial literacy can
   help to identify individuals who are more likely to be able and willing
   to study financial reporting information with reasonable diligence as
   they form their investment-related judgments.},

   followed by a third experiment on single decision makers. Relative to
   equilibrium predictions, committees with uncorrelated preferences
   oversearched under minority and majority voting rules but, otherwise,
   undersearched or approximated equilibrium play. Individually, committee
   members were often less strategic when their preferences were
   uncorrelated than when they were perfectly correlated. Collectively,
   committees' decisions were more strategic than single decision makers'
   only under the unanimity rule, although still not significantly better
   in terms of the decision makers' welfare. Finally, across our

Abstract = {Dairy cooperatives bestow upon farmers the virtues of controlling a
   large supply quantity of a relatively scarce product, that is, milk
   (e.g., higher bargaining power, fixed cost sharing, etc.). However, the
   cooperative structure also encourages individual farmers to free-ride
   (i.e., provide low-quality milk in the hope that other farmers provide
   good-quality milk). The question arises: How can the benefits of a
   cooperative be retained, while eliminating free-riding, especially when
   individual inspection costs are high? We examine this question from the
   perspective of a social planner, who wishes to achieve the simultaneous
   goals of quantity efficiency, quality efficiency, and minimal testing.
   The basic challenge in this quest is that of countering an endogenous
   value function associated with a coalition of farmers. This value
   function emerges from the joint interaction of three forces: (i) an
   individual farmer's payment-maximizing behavior, (ii) the testing
   policies employed by the cooperative, and (iii) the manner in which the
   revenue earned by a coalition is shared among the farmers (allocation
   rule). A novel allocation rule-that exploits individual incentives to
   guide the collective behavior of the farmers and thereby the
   value-function endogeneity-is proposed that achieves the planner's goals

Abstract = {The role of affective ties and informal social networks in management
   practices is recognised across many parts of the world; guanxi in China,
   yongo in Korea, blat in Russia and wasta in the Arab World are some
   manifestations. This paper explores the role of such informal networks
   in Pakistan by studying the role of sifarish-the act of achieving ends
   on the basis of network connections-in hiring in Pakistan using thematic
   analysis of inductively collected qualitative data from 104 individuals
   from four large organisations. Using social network and social capital
   theory, the paper highlights the key characteristics of affective
   networks in Pakistan, comparing them to social networks in other
   cultural settings. Further, the concept of ethical relativism is used to
   create a distinction between ethical and unethical sifarish. Thus, the
   paper enhances understanding of HRM in Pakistan, and contributes towards
   the literature on cross-cultural HRM, social networks and ethical
   relativism.},

Volume = {65},

Abstract = {The purpose of this research is to examine the impact that news about
   supply chain operations related to the triple bottom line (TBL) has on
   consumers' perceptions. Specifically, it focuses on how sustainability
   successes and failures in a company's supply chain operations influence
   consumer perceptions of product quality. These perceptions are based on
   a spillover effect. The research study is set up across three
   experiments. Study one tests for the spillover effect in supply chain
   TBL-related news and demonstrates that negative supply chain news across
   all three TBL dimensions reduces quality perceptions. Study two examines
   the effect across three levels of negative news intensity and finds that
   the spillover effect is consistent, even with stronger levels of
   negativity. Study three investigates whether a firm can improve damaged
   quality perceptions and purchase intentions through a recovery effort.
   The results of study three suggest that consumers' perceptions and
   purchase intentions are generally reparable. Collectively, the findings
   should encourage firms to more rigorously consider how news about their
   supply chain operations may impact consumers' perceptions and intentions
   toward the firm's products.},

Abstract = {This study examines the outcome of collective political strategy across

   that collective political strategy can result in varied distortions of
   environmental policies, depending on the ideology of government actors,
   the electoral cycle and the type of prevalent bureaucratic regulatory
   system. An interesting finding in this regard is that left-leaning
   governments react more favorably to political strategies by industries.
   The study highlights the important role cross-country heterogeneity of
   political systems plays in influencing the outcomes of collective
   political strategies.},

Volume = {43},
Number = {5},

Abstract = {The literature has posited that agglomeration economies and the
   formation of social relationships resulting from the geographic
   concentration of incumbents constitute the forces that ``pull{''} new
   entrants into industry clusters. However, this proposition overlooks how
   the collective action of incumbents in pursuit of their own benefits
   affects new entrants. This study examines how business associations as
   collective action organizations established by incumbents to promote and
   safeguard group-wide interests contribute to de novo entrants. The
   empirical evidence from Canada's telecommunication equipment
   manufacturing industry between 1995 and 2005 reveals that the prevalence
   of local business associations encourages de novo entrants. However, the
   impact is curvilinear such that excessive collective action on the part
   of local fellow incumbents can create a clubby environment and
   ``push{''} new entrants away.},

Abstract = {The notion of community infers unity and a source of moral obligations
   in an organisational ethic between individuals or groups. As such, a
   community, having a strong sense of collective identity, may foster
   collective action to promote social change for the betterment of
   society. This research critically explores notions of community through
   analysing discursive identity construction practices within a
   member-owned urban consumer co-operative (CC) public house in the UK. A
   strong sense of community is an often-claimed CC characteristic. The
   paper's main contributions stem from using the lens of identity work to
   critically unpack the notion of community through highlighting
   paradoxical tensions of community residing within CCs. The findings
   reveal that the notion of community may be illusionary with
   counter-veiling forces, one that reflects a more traditional sense of
   connection, attachment and communion, and the other of boundaries,
   disconnection or division. As these repertoires collide, tensions are
   evident between the hegemonic discourse of neoliberal managerialism and
   that of democratic collective ownership. Despite these individual-level
   tensions, communities may operate within boundaries enabling an
   organisational and societal ethic, beyond the individual.},

Volume = {58},
Number = {5, SI},
Pages = {489-502},

Abstract = {This article applies a social relations discourse to examine the use of
   expatriates in Chinese multinational companies (MNCs). Expatriates are
   analyzed based on two sets of social relations: the social functions of
   expatriates (which include the global function of capital and the
   collective function of labor) and the pathways of expatriation (which
   include intra- and interfirm transfers). In particular, the framework
   incorporates the collective function of labor into the analysis of
   expatriation, which has received limited attention in the existing
   international HRM literature. Conceptually, the social relations
   discourse allowed us to frame staffing in an open system in which HR
   practices involving expatriation are shaped by the intersections between
   the choices of MNCs, the actions of workers, and the mediation of
   institutional players. Empirically, this article presents three case
   studies of Chinese MNCs in Europe to illustrate the tiered expatriation
   of managerial staff, technicians, and operational workers from
   interchangeable sources of labor. The HR policy implications suggest
   greater diversity in the formation of international staffing for MNCs.},

Abstract = {In this paper we focus on the development of professional accountability
   systems as a form of systemic power to enhance institutional control,
   particularly on the associated institutional politics - the interplay
   between institutional control and institutional work by different
   (collective) actors. We address the dialectical nature of these
   institutional politics and identify three types of power tactics
   underpinning institutional work: attacking, anticipating and defending.
   Articulating these power tactics revealed the dialectical flux of power
   tactics between different parties, and how this in turn arose from and
   affected the development and strength of (new) systemic power. This
   shows how gaining institutional control over mostly self-employed
   professionals (veterinarians) through systemic power without legislation
   is a more sophisticated process than often assumed based on studies of
   professionals working in large service firms.},

Abstract = {While prior research focuses on the audit team made up of auditors, we
   focus on the collective audit team made up of auditors and
   specialists-in our context, information technology (IT) specialists.
   Complex systems in today's audits and researcher and regulator concerns
   regarding ineffective coordination and communication between the two
   specializations motivate better understanding of this collective audit
   team. We investigate how auditors and IT specialists perceive their
   relationship and how the audit process unfolds when these relationships
   are good and when they are difficult. Results of interviews conducted
   with Big 4 audit and IT practitioners provide evidence that they
   perceive their relationship quality to depend on the level of mutual
   value and respect. Auditors assert a one-team view of the collective
   audit team that includes IT specialists, but IT specialists feel
   auditors see them as a separate team and a ``necessary evil.{''} The
   audit process vastly differs between relationships perceived as
   difficult and good. In difficult relationships, the two specializations
   often struggle for status, with limited communication or effort to
   understand how their work fits together. Our findings imply difficult
   relationships are at risk for poor integration and unsupported reliance
   on IT functions, shedding light on recurring threats to audit quality
   identified by PCAOB inspections. In good relationships, auditors and IT
   specialists appear motivated to engage in frequent and open
   communication to help understand, coordinate, and complete the audit.
   Inferences gleaned from good relationships let us highlight
   prescriptions for audit firms to improve effectiveness of collective
   audit teams.},

Abstract = {Research Summary Categories are important cognitive and social
   interfaces for entrepreneurs and new ventures. However, the categories
   forged by the state and public agencies have been largely overlooked by
   the literature. A historical narrative explores the categorization
   process to register French mail order companies in an administrative
   nomenclature. This categorization performs reality by providing legality
   to a new population and by producing enduring social boundaries.
   Moreover, the historical reasoning enables to assimilate the emergence
   of a new category with a co-evolutionary process, avoiding the
   reification of categories by considering multilevel interactions.
   Finally, our narrative highlights the need to consider the interests of
   entrepreneurs and public actors symmetrically. Managerial Summary How do
   the state and public agencies categorize new activities? Such
   categorization can have substantial consequences for entrepreneurs in
   terms of subsidies, regulation, or control. A historical narrative is
   built to trace the emergence of the French mail order category in a
   public nomenclature. This narrative suggests that the categorization
   results from the convergence of three evolutions over time: a growing
   interest of public policy in retailing; the development of the French
   statistical apparatus after world war II (WWII); and the collective
   entrepreneurship of the mail order companies. Entrepreneurs should
   consequently dedicate attention to the tools for recording economic
   activity, be aware of windows of opportunity occurring in the
   categorization process and eventually take action to influence the way
   they are categorized.},

Abstract = {Research Summary Studying the organizational design of entrepreneurial
   ventures involves investigating how entrepreneurs design the (formal)
   structure of their ventures as well as the roles, rules, and procedures
   that those who are active within these ventures must obey. The topic
   lies at the intersection of entrepreneurship with multiple fields,
   including organization science, organizational economics, and strategic
   management. However, to date, it has attracted limited attention. This
   special issue includes six articles that develop novel theory and
   provide new empirical evidence on the antecedents and consequences of
   the organizational design of entrepreneurial ventures. Collectively they
   offer fresh perspectives on this neglected topic and open avenues for
   future work. In this article, we briefly describe the state of the
   field, introduce the articles, and suggest opportunities for further
   research. Managerial Summary There are countless how-to guides for
   entrepreneurs describing start-up legal structures, incubation and
   acceleration opportunities, and financing options. Conversely, there is
   relatively little guidance for how entrepreneurs should design their
   organizational structure, decision systems, and managerial practices.
   This special issue contains six articles addressing the organizational
   design of entrepreneurial ventures from multiple perspectives and with
   diverse methods. This introduction describes the state of the field
   prior to the special issue, introduces the special issue articles and
   identifies topics that still need further investigation. We distill the
   current state of knowledge and offer a roadmap for future scholarship.},

Abstract = {We find a positive relation between the amount of pension deficits and
   the cost of bank loans. The effect of pension deficits on the cost of
   bank loans is driven by financial constraints, information-asymmetry
   problems, and higher pension-investment risk. Banks tighten lending
   terms for firms with larger pension deficits by requiring collateral,
   increasing the number of loan covenants, and shortening loan maturity.
   Borrowers with larger pension deficits are also more likely to violate
   covenants in the future. Collectively, these findings indicate that
   pension deficits represent an additional source of risk priced by banks.},

Title = {How ex-auditors remember their past: The transformation of audit
   experience into cultural memory},
Journal = {ACCOUNTING ORGANIZATIONS AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {77},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Researchers have examined the socialization of auditors at various
   stages of their professional development, but they have done little or
   no work on the continued effects of this socialization after auditors
   leave the firms. Put simply, they have not explored the ways that
   ex-auditors remember their past. Drawing on the literature in social
   memory studies and on 37 semi-structured interviews with ex-auditors who
   used to be employed at large Canadian accounting firms, we perform
   memory work to examine how ex-auditors transform their audit experience
   into cultural memory. The narratives of past audit experience elicited
   during the interviews reveal that ex-auditors develop a complex
   contemporary representation of this experience. When they solicited
   their communicative (individual) memories, our participants remembered
   multiple conflicts between their self-identity and the normative work
   environment during their time at the firms. However, when they reflected
   on the impact of their audit experience on their new careers, an
   alternative and much more collective version of this past emerged.
   Cultural memories with an elitist and class work dynamic that maintained
   and justified claims of professional and social superiority began to
   predominate. We argue that communicative and cultural memory are
   connected because it is communicative memory that allows cultural memory
   to take on social forms and exercise cultural domination. Our study
   makes three important contributions. First, it broadens the
   socio-temporal perspective of auditing research by highlighting the
   continued effects of the professional identity of auditors after they
   change careers. Second, it shows that representations of the past
   provide ex-auditors with a powerful means to promote their professional
   interests and structure power relationships within organizations. Third,
   it introduces the use of reflexive memory work as a rigorous
   methodological approach in accounting and organizational research. (C)

Abstract = {This study examines the performance consequences of planned turnover. In
   particular, we investigate the departure of temporary workers due to the
   expiration of their contracts. We reconcile the contradictory
   predictions of collective turnover research-that any type of worker's
   exit impairs organizational performance-and of contingent work
   research-that temporary workers' exits improve organizational
   performance because they provide flexibility. We argue that the planned
   turnover of temporary workers has an inverted U-shaped relationship with
   unit performance because it combines flexibility benefits and disruption
   costs. We also argue that the costs of planned temporary worker turnover
   are moderated by the proportion and the firm-specific experience of
   their replacements. We test these arguments using longitudinal monthly
   data from a leading multinational company in the food and beverage
   industry, and find support for our hypotheses. The study suggests that
   managers hiring temporary workers should consider the cost of losing
   them and challenges the widespread scholarly and managerial assumption
   that temporary workers are disposable resources.},

   remain scant. We posit that the social audience in general, and people
   working in organizations in particular, sort organizations into
   categories ({''}organizational forms{''}) and rely on knowledge of the
   taken-for-granted external identities of firms in these categories to
   interpret their experience as employees. Although many of these
   interpretations revolve around size, categorical distinctions between
   ``small{''} and ``large{''} firms pack concepts and ideas that extend
   significantly beyond a simple distinction based on size, and would be
   better understood as an organizational form distinction between
   specialist and generalist firms. Focusing on the organizational form of
   a specialist, we claim that two features of its form identity work
   against each other to influence turnover: employees of specialists
   realize that it is hard to develop careers internally (a push factor)
   but value the more relaxed environment, meaningful work, and flexibility
   of their jobs (a pull effect). We propose a theory to parse out the two
   effects, find empirical support for it in analyses of managerial
   turnover in the Korean TV advertising industry, and conclude that the
   construct of organizational form offers an opportunity to extend models
   of career mobility and individual turnover.},

Abstract = {Measurement error is ubiquitous in experimental work. It leads to
   imperfect statistical controls, attenuated estimated effects of elicited
   behaviors, and biased correlations between characteristics. We develop
   statistical techniques for handling experimental measurement error.
   These techniques are applied to data from the Caltech Cohort Study,
   which conducts repeated incentivized surveys of the Caltech student
   body. We replicate three classic experiments, demonstrating that results
   change substantially when measurement error is accounted for.
   Collectively, these results show that failing to properly account for
   measurement error may cause a field-wide bias leading scholars to
   identify ``new{''} phenomena.},

   controls and hybrids},
Journal = {ACCOUNTING ORGANIZATIONS AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {77},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {We study how multiple firms voluntarily design inter-firm mechanisms to
   manage industry-level systemic uncertainty. Facing a threat of systemic
   uncertainty that cannot be addressed by any one firm, we explain how the
   Australian cotton industry mobilised hybrids and boundary spanners to
   develop an industry-level solution at the inter-firm level. We apply
   resource dependence theory to extend Miller, Kurunmaki and O'Leary
   (2008), and identify a broader range of hybrid characteristics (novel,
   inter-firm, public/private and open source) than currently acknowledged
   in accounting studies. We use these characteristics to explain how
   hybrid organisational forms and hybrid control processes operate at the
   inter-firm level to develop and share a solution to systemic
   uncertainty, which are subsequently applied at the firm-level. Our
   findings also show how boundary spanners can operate with less tension
   in larger industry-level collaborations, explained using our resource
   dependence conceptualisation. This responds to Dekker's (2016) calls for
   more inter-firm research clarifying how controls operate beyond the
   firm. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {46},
Number = {2},
Pages = {246-266},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Ironic consumption refers to using a product (brand, style, behavior,
   etc.) with the intent of signaling a meaning (identity, message, belief,
   etc.) that reverses the conventional meaning of the product. We report
   five studies showing that people are more likely to think that a
   consumer is using a product ironically when the product is incongruent
   with the consumer's known identity or beliefs. The impression that
   ironic consumers make on an observer depends on the observer's
   relationship with the consumed product. When a consumer uses a product
   associated with the observer's in-group (e.g., wearing a ``Powered by
   Kale{''} shirt in front of a vegan), observers have a less favorable
   impression if they believe the consumer is using the product ironically.
   Conversely, when a consumer uses a product that is not associated with
   the observer's in-group (e.g., wearing a ``Powered by Kale{''} shirt in
   front of a meat-eater), observers have a more favorable impression if
   they believe the consumer is using the product ironically. Collectively,
   our studies suggest that consumers can use products ironically to
   selectively signal one meaning to an in-group (who is likely to detect
   irony), and another to out-groups (who are unlikely to detect irony).},

Volume = {97},

Month = {JUL-AUG},
Abstract = {Nobody really recommends command-and-control leadership anymore. But no
   fully formed alternative has emerged. So mature companies often struggle
   to balance the need for innovation with the need for discipline.
   The authors studied two exceptions: the new-product development stars
   PARC and W.L. Gore. Both companies, they learned, have three distinct
   types of leaders. Entrepreneurial leaders, found at lower levels, create
   new products and services and move their firms into unexplored
   territory. Enabling leaders, in the middle, make sure the entrepreneurs
   have the resources they need. And architecting leaders, near the top,
   monitor culture, high-level strategy, and structure.
   This system allows both companies to be self-managing to a surprising
   degree. Employees choose their work assignments and dream up new
   projects, whose success rests on colleagues' volunteering to join in
   making the companies collective prediction markets. And the mechanisms
   that enable self-management also balance freedom and control: The
   companies function efficiently and exploit new opportunities even as
   they minimize rules.},

Volume = {45},

Abstract = {Shame is a powerful and relevant discrete emotion in the workplace, as
   organizations are rife with potential to induce shame, and reactions to
   shame relate to important organizationally relevant outcomes. In this
   article, we review shame-related research from a variety of disciplines,
   integrating and identifying common patterns to better understand the
   shame process as it relates to organizational life. In doing so, we
   develop a framework that outlines the more internal psychological
   processes at the heart of the emotion of shame and situates these
   processes within the context of organizations. This framework highlights
   the organizational factors that help instigate shame in employees (i.e.,
   unintentional shame triggers and purposeful shaming behaviors) as well
   as the behavioral outcomes important to organizations (i.e., prosocial,
   withdrawal, and aggressive behaviors) and provides insights regarding
   moderators that likely impact this process. In addition, we discuss
   future research implications as they pertain to each of the components
   in our framework, hoping that our article not only improves our
   understanding of organizational shame but encourages much-needed future
   research on it.},

Abstract = {Entrepreneurs who start a business to serve both self-interests and
   collective interests by addressing unmet social and environmental needs
   are usually referred to as sustainable entrepreneurs. Compared with
   regular entrepreneurs, we argue that sustainable entrepreneurs face
   specific challenges when establishing their businesses owing to the
   discrepancy between the creation and appropriation of private value and
   social value. We hypothesize that when starting a business, sustainable
   entrepreneurs (1) feel more hampered by perceived barriers, such as the
   institutional environment and (2) have a different risk attitude and
   perception than regular entrepreneurs. We use two waves of the Flash
   Eurobarometer survey on entrepreneurship (2009 and 2012), which contains
   information on start-up motivations, start-up barriers, and risk
   perceptions of approximately 3000 (prospective) business owners across
   33 countries. We find that sustainable entrepreneurs indeed perceive
   more institutional barriers in terms of a lack of financial,
   administrative, and informational support at business start-up than
   regular entrepreneurs. Further, no significant differences between
   sustainable and regular entrepreneurs are found in terms of their risk
   attitudes or perceived financial risks. However, sustainable
   entrepreneurs are more likely to fear personal failure than regular
   entrepreneurs, which is explained by their varied and complex
   stakeholder relations. These insights may serve as an important signal
   for both governments and private capital providers in enhancing the
   institutional climate.},

Title = {Relevance insensitivity: A new look at some old biases},
Journal = {ORGANIZATIONAL BEHAVIOR AND HUMAN DECISION PROCESSES},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {153},
Pages = {13-26},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {People show systematic biases in judgment and decision making. We
   propose that many seemingly disparate biases reflect a common underlying
   mechanism-insensitivity to the relevance of some given information-and
   that manipulating the relevance of the information can eliminate or even
   reverse the original bias. We test our theory in four experiments, each
   focusing on a classic bias-the sunk cost fallacy, non-regressive
   prediction, anchoring bias, and base rate neglect, and show that people
   over-rely on a given piece of information when it is irrelevant, thus
   exhibiting one bias, and under-rely on the same piece of information
   when it is highly relevant, thus showing a reverse bias. For example,
   when a past cost is irrecoverable and hence irrelevant to future cost,
   people over-rely on it when making a decision for the future, thus
   exhibiting the classic sunk cost fallacy, but when the past cost is
   fully recoverable and hence highly relevant to future cost, people
   under-rely on it, thus showing the reverse of the sunk cost fallacy. We
   also find that when people are made sensitive to the relevance of the
   information, both the original biases and their reverse biases are
   attenuated. This research offers a new look at these ``old{''} biases,
   suggesting that each individual bias is not general because it can be
   reversed, but collectively, these biases are general because they all
   reflect relevance insensitivity.},

Abstract = {The purpose of diversity initiatives is to help groups that face
   disadvantage in society achieve better outcomes in organizations, but
   they do not necessarily work as intended. To advance understanding of
   the effects of diversity initiatives, I develop a typological theory of
   their unintended consequences. I propose that diversity initiatives
   produce four unintended consequence types: backfire (negative diversity
   goal progress), negative spillover (undesirable effects on outcomes
   other than diversity goal progress), positive spillover (desirable
   effects on outcomes other than diversity goal progress), and false
   progress (improved diversity metrics without true diversity goal
   progress). I then adopt a signaling perspective to identify mechanisms
   underlying the four types and the diversity practices most likely to
   produce them. The resulting typological theory not only provides an
   organizing framework for prior work on the unintended consequences of
   diversity initiatives but also specifies new unintended consequence
   types, identifies signals that serve as their root causes, and suggests
   that the unintended consequences of diversity initiatives are
   interrelated and multidetermined. Collectively, these contributions
   advance a broader conceptualization of diversity initiative
   effectiveness, in which a wider range of mechanisms and outcomes, as
   well as the relationships among them, must be considered. More
   comprehensive theory regarding their unintended consequences provides a
   foundation for increasing diversity initiative effectiveness.},

Month = {JUL-AUG},
Abstract = {We consider a capacity provider and a group of independent buyers who
   partner to share a scarce but expensive-to-build capacity over a finite
   horizon under privately informed demand conditions. At the beginning of
   the time horizon, the capacity provider must invest in building
   capacity; all members may invest in increasing their own and possibly
   other members' market sizes. Then each member observes and updates its
   private, history-dependent demand information over time. Because the
   value of the capacity to each member is highly uncertain when investment
   is made, achieving the first-best outcome while sustaining under a
   dynamic environment is challenging for the partnership. We address this
   issue by proposing a multiperiod membership-type agreement (referred to
   as the Agreement) as a series of single-period contracts with flexible
   terms that are renegotiated each period. The Agreement enforces ex post
   efficient capacity allocation and ex ante efficient investment. The set
   of interpartner transfers in the Agreement makes each member a residual
   claimant to the surplus it creates, and hence induces truthful demand
   reports. This contract is also budget balanced and voluntary. In doing
   so, we develop a new solution concept for dynamic collective action
   mechanisms.},

Abstract = {Applying grounded theory, we comprehensively categorize capabilities
   needed for market-shaping and synthesize them into a conceptual
   framework that describes the process and its outcomes. We establish that
   in order to improve value creation in a market, market-shapers must
   consider a larger system of relevant stakeholders, recognize the
   institutional arrangements governing their behaviors, and foster new
   resource linkages within and across stakeholders. Based on our analysis,
   we identify eight triggering capabilities, which generate new intra- and
   inter-stakeholder resource linkages by directly influencing various
   characteristics of the market, and four facilitating capabilities, which
   enable market-shaping by discovering the value potential of new resource
   linkages and augment the impact of the triggering capabilities by
   mobilizing relevant resources. We show that triggering capabilities are
   context-specific, whereas facilitating capabilities are generic. We
   conclude that there are performance outcomes of market-shaping not only
   for the shaping firm, but also for other stakeholders, and at overall
   market level.},

Title = {Employee service performance and collective turnover: Examining the
   influence of initiating structure leadership, service climate and
   meaningfulness},
Journal = {HUMAN RELATIONS},
Year = {2019},

Abstract = {Organizations typically rely on their employees to provide high-quality
   service as a strategy for sustaining a competitive advantage. However,
   service-related jobs can have deleterious effects on employees-including
   negative health and attitudinal outcomes, such as burnout and decreased
   motivation-which also carry ramifications for organizations, including
   turnover. How might organizations mitigate these consequences? We posit
   that organizations can equip managers to create work environments
   conducive to employee motivation and performance because managers have
   substantial influence over the context within which service-oriented
   behaviors occur. Thus, drawing on social information processing theory
   and theory on work motivation, we build and test a path model that
   explains how and why an important type of leadership behavior-initiating
   structure leadership-enhances employees' service performance and reduces
   collective turnover. Our multilevel analyses using multisource lagged
   data reveal that initiating structure leader behavior creates a
   high-quality service climate, which then influences meaningfulness at
   the individual and work-unit levels. At the individual level, our
   results show that employee motivation of meaningfulness positively
   relates to supervisor-rated employee service performance. Finally,
   results show that collective meaningfulness negatively relates to
   objective collective turnover as obtained from company archival records.
   Theoretical and practical implications of our study are discussed.},

   Effects: An Integrative Perspective on Indirect Social Influence

Abstract = {Research on trickle effects has proliferated in the past decade.
   However, the literature has grown in a largely disorganized and
   fragmented fashion, with the different types of trickle effects
   (trickle-down, trickle-out, trickle-up, trickle-in, and trickle-around)
   often examined as independent phenomena. To better understand and
   integrate this research, we provide a comprehensive review of the
   empirical literature of trickle effects. In particular, drawing on an
   indirect social influence perspective, we clarify the definition of
   trickle effects as a process whereby perceptions, feelings, attitudes,
   or behaviors of a source affect perceptions, feelings, attitudes, or
   behaviors of a transmitter, which in turn affect perceptions, feelings,
   attitudes, or behaviors of a recipient. We then review the works
   collectively, cataloging them by trickle type. Next, we examine boundary
   conditions (moderators) of the effects, methodologies utilized, and the
   theoretical accounts proposed to explain the effects. Finally, we
   introduce a conceptual framework that allows us to organize
   trickle-effects research and identify paths for future trickle-effects

Title = {Bolstering Managers' Resistance to Temptation via the Firm's Commitment
   to Corporate Social Responsibility},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ETHICS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {157},
Number = {2},
Pages = {303-318},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Behavioral ethics research has focused predominantly on how the
   attributes of individuals influence their ethicality. Relatively
   neglected has been how macro-level factors such as the behavior of firms
   influence members' ethicality. Researchers have noted specifically that
   we know little about how a firm's CSR influences members' behaviors. We
   seek to better merge these literatures and gain a deeper understanding
   of the role macro-level influences have on manager's ethicality. Based
   on agency theory and social identity theory, we hypothesize that a
   company's commitment to CSR shifts managers' focus away from
   self-interests toward the interests of the firm, bolstering resistance
   to temptation. We propose this occurs through self-categorization and
   collective identification processes. We conduct a 2x2 factorial
   experiment in which managers make expense decisions for a company with
   commitment to CSR either present or absent, and temptation either
   present or absent. Results indicate that under temptation, managers make
   decisions consistent with self-interest. More importantly, we find when
   commitment to CSR is present, managers are more likely to make ethical
   decisions in the presence of temptation. Overall, this research
   highlights the interactive role of two key contextual factorstemptation
   and firm CSR commitmentin influencing managers' ethical decisions. While
   limited research has highlighted the positive effects that a firm's CSR
   has on its employees' attitudes, the current results demonstrate CSR's
   effects on ethical behavior and imply that through conducting and
   communicating its CSR efforts internally, firms can in part limit the
   deleterious effects of temptation on managers' decisions.},

   relation is more pronounced in countries with high government ownership
   of banks, high corruption in bank lending, a left-oriented government,
   and a collectivist national culture, which provides additional support
   for the soft-budget-constraint view. Finally, in external validity
   tests, we find that state ownership affects other aspects of debt
   structure, such as debt maturity and debt security.},

   following a debt covenant violation, cross-sectional analyses indicate
   that these changes in non-GAAP reporting are concentrated among firms
   with strong governance. Moreover, we find that investor demand for
   disclosure (proxied by analyst-provided non-GAAP performance metrics and
   EDGAR search volume) increases following a covenant violation.
   Collectively, our evidence is consistent with heightened investor
   scrutiny following covenant violations, and it casts doubt on the
   competing explanation that shareholders delegate monitoring to creditors
   following a covenant violation. Overall, our evidence provides new
   insights on the determinants of firms' non-GAAP reporting practices and
   an alternative view about how debt covenant violations influence
   voluntary disclosure.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we explain how and why collective emotions enable
   institutional creation work. Based on an ethnography in Limonade, a
   Haitian community affected by the 2010 earthquake, we identify social
   practices that elicit collective emotions through the creation of new
   institutions across the three disaster recovery phases. Our study's key
   insight is that new institutions converge collective emotions such that
   they in turn justify ongoing, as well as motivate engagement in new,
   institutional creation work practices. Theorizing from our findings, we
   develop a generative model that describes the justifying and motivating
   function of collective emotions in the establishment of embedded
   institutions. In conclusion, our paper advances theory on collective
   emotions in institutional work and generates implications for
   post-disaster management practice.},

   experience and the real or imagined happiness in the coworker-as an
   alternative response to envy and distinguish it from related concepts in
   the organizational literature. We develop a theoretical framework to
   explain the psychological processes that underlie envy and positive
   empathy, and identify individual and contextual contingencies that might
   incline employees to experience these emotions. Lastly, we discuss
   individual and organizational outcomes of envy and positive empathy and
   explain implications for management research and practice.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ETHICS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {156},
Number = {4},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {In this paper, we consider how dignity is discursively constructed in
   the context of work dominated by physicality and dirt. Based on
   semi-structured interviews with garbage workers, our analysis considers
   how the deprivations they experience are cast through discourses
   intended to construct their individual and collective worth. We consider
   the manner in which dignity maybe denied to such workers through popular
   repudiations of individuality and status. We demonstrate how this
   positioning arises from contact with physical dirt, and associations
   with socially dirty work based on ascriptions of servility, abuse and
   ambivalence. We go on to consider how garbage workers respond to this
   positioning through discourses of everyday heroism'. Heroism is evoked
   through three inter-related narratives that speaks to a particular type
   of masculinity. The first takes the form of a classic process of
   reframing and recalibration through which workers not only renegotiate
   their public position and status, but also point to the inherent value
   to be had in working with dirt as part of that which we identify as a
   process of affirmation'. The second narrative arises from the imposition
   of favourable social and occupational comparisons that effectively
   elevate garbage collectors' social position. The third discourseand
   previously unobserved in respect of garbage workcentres on paternalistic
   practices of care. Combined, these discourses disrupt the generally held
   view that dirty work is antithetical to heroism and wounds dignity.},

Journal = {ACADEMY OF MANAGEMENT JOURNAL},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {62},
Number = {3},
Pages = {850-882},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {This paper draws on a longitudinal interpretive case study to develop a
   theoretical model of how actions by people across an organization
   coevolve strategy and structure in order to realize a mandated radical
   change. Mandated change, imposed by a powerful external actor, extends
   understanding of the dynamics of radical change. While other studies
   have examined how unintended consequences shape the way radical change
   is realized, under mandated change, actors focus on bringing about the
   change in ways that will be, collectively, considered to realize the
   intended mandate. Our study, grounded in a practice approach concerning
   how actions bring about radical change, identifies three different
   action cycles: performing action cycles, reinforcing action cycles, and
   reflecting action cycles. Shifts in cycles are triggered by unintended
   consequences that escalate into breakdowns. Cumulative cycles, arising
   from the escalation of unintended consequences that lead to breakdowns,
   are necessary for bringing about a mandated change in strategy and
   structure. Following breakdown, actors switch to reflecting actions in
   which they consider the underlying intent of the mandate and how to
   modify the espoused strategy and structure to bring about that intent.},

Abstract = {I develop approaches that quantify the use of discretion for the three
   main assumptions used for the financial reporting of defined benefit
   pension obligations: the expected return, the discount rate, and the
   compensation rate. I then apply these approaches to two regulatory
   events that affected a different subset of these three assumptions.
   Across both settings, my analyses indicate that firms reduced discretion
   in response to regulatory scrutinybut only in those assumptions targeted
   by the regulatory event. In contrast, I find that firms increased the
   use of discretion in the other assumptions, consistent with a
   substitution effect. I also find that the use of discretion in the
   discount rate and compensation rate are approximately two to three times
   more effective at changing reported earnings than the use of discretion
   in the expected return. Collectively, my analyses highlight the
   interdependence of the three main pension assumptions and the relative
   weakness of the expected return as an earnings management tool.},

Journal = {MIS QUARTERLY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {43},
Number = {2},

Abstract = {Organizations facing high risks and operating in purely digital domains,
   such as computer security and many financial services, must meet two,
   contradictory goals: they need to identify digital threats at scale and
   speed while also avoiding errors that result from automated processing.
   Research on high-reliability organizations has identified multiple
   challenges in reaching these goals simultaneously, because automation
   often renders organizations' operations ``mindless{''} and unable to
   cope gracefully with changing, complex situations characteristic of
   high-risk domains. In digital operations, a special challenge arises
   from the ``frame problem{''} connected with the inability of algorithms
   to adapt to environments not identified within their developers' initial
   cognitive frames. An exploratory, theory-generating case study was
   conducted within a computer security company (F-Secure) to examine how
   organizations acting in digital domains may achieve high reliability by
   mitigating the frame problem. This article examines digital organizing
   of the epistemic and pragmatic features of operations, along with
   arrangements of these features that respond to the frame problem.
   Collective mindfulness is identified as emerging in such a
   sociotechnical setting via a carefully layered, systemic constellation
   of (human) mindful and (digital) mindless operations while the
   organization's core operations remain digital and algorithmic. The
   findings point to heretofore unexplored reliability challenges
   associated with digital organizing, alongside several relevant ways to
   overcome and/or mitigate them.},

Abstract = {Our study investigated how multi-centenary family firms in the area of
   Kyoto - collectively known as shinise - maintain a high social status in
   the community. Our analysis unpacks the socio-cultural practices through
   which the ongoing interaction among these actors re-enacts and
   reproduces the social order that ascribes shinise a distinct social
   standing in exchange for their continued commitment to practices and
   structures that help the community preserve its cultural integrity and
   collective identity. By doing so, our findings trace a connection
   between status maintenance and the expressive function that a category
   of firms performs within a community. At the same time, our study
   reveals a dark side of high status, by showing how their commitments
   lock shinise in a position of `benign entrapment' that may impose
   sacrifices on family members and severe limitations to their personal
   freedom.},

Volume = {62},
Number = {3},

Abstract = {Despite wide consensus that leader vision is a key vehicle for leaders
   to motivate followers to support organizational change, it remains far
   from clear what characterizes an effective vision of change. Research on
   organizational change that has used a social identity perspective has
   asserted that one important reason why followers resist change is
   because change may pose a threat to their subjective sense of continuity
   of organizational identity. Accordingly, we hypothesize that leaders
   that communicate visions of change can address this resistance by
   assuring followers that the essence of the organizational identity will
   remain unchanged-making their vision of change also a vision of
   continuity. In line with our proposition that collective continuity is
   valued because it serves an uncertainty-reduction function, such visions
   should be more predictive of vision effectiveness the higher follower
   work-related uncertainty. Across a field study and an experimental study
   we find support for these predictions.},

Journal = {ADMINISTRATIVE SCIENCE QUARTERLY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {64},
Number = {2},
Pages = {435-465},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {We develop theory on how a contentious moral market can develop, and we
   test it with data from a study of the commercialization of Buddhist
   temples in China from 2006 to 2016, as local government officials try to
   boost the local economy by transforming temples into tourist enterprises
   that charge admission fees. The practice is resisted by monks and the
   public such that the central government, which values public appearances
   of social justice, is pressured to support their resistance to local
   officials' economic demands. Using a data panel of 141 temples, we show
   that temples' admission fees are significantly related to the pressure
   that local government officials face to develop the economy. We also
   find that resistance to the fees exploits a factional political
   structure, as the monk-led movement leverages the influence of one
   political clique that is highly concerned with public appearances of
   social justice to resist the request of another. In addition, bottom-up
   channels such as the Internet and marketized media help the public voice
   its grievances, coordinate collective action, and therefore align with
   and mobilize the central government to override local government. The
   contentious view enhances our understanding of how resistance can be
   possible and effective, especially in an authoritarian regime.},
