Abstract = {Platform-based technology ecosystems are new forms of organizing
   independent actors' innovations around a stable product system. This
   collective organization is proving superior to traditional, vertically
   integrated systems in many sectors because of greater
   ``generativity{''}-the ecosystem's capacity to foster complementary
   innovation from autonomous, heterogeneous firms-which extends the usage
   scope and value of the platform to users. However, greater generativity
   can also lead to greater variance in the way ecosystem members'
   contributions satisfy users' needs, and it could potentially hinder the
   ecosystems' value creation. We draw on collective action theory to
   examine generativity's impact on user satisfaction and the mechanisms
   driving it. We argue that products enhancing user satisfaction
   contribute to a collective, shared asset, the platform system
   reputation, from which all participants benefit. Thus, generativity has
   both a positive (system reputation) and negative (free-riding) effect on
   the ecosystem members' incentives for developing products that enhance
   user satisfaction. We argue that the negative free-riding effect
   prevails as the platform system matures and competition with alternative
   platform systems increases. Using data from the video game industry, we
   find supportive evidence for the free-riding effect, which generates an
   average loss in total revenue for first-rate games of about \$36.5
   million and a drop of about 3.3\% in the console's market share. By
   identifying the conditions that exacerbate free riding in platform
   ecosystems, our study contributes to the understanding of the
   evolutionary dynamics of platform ecosystems. It also highlights one
   feedback mechanism governing collective action in ecosystems and its
   implications for value creation.},

Title = {Does Fair Trade Breed Contempt? A Cross-Country Examination on the
   Moderating Role of Brand Familiarity and Consumer Expertise on Product
   Evaluation},

Volume = {156},

Abstract = {This article is a within- and cross-country examination of the impact of
   fair trade certification on consumers' evaluations and attitudes toward
   ethically certified products. Across three experimental studies, the
   authors analyze how different levels of brand familiarity and fair trade
   expertise impact consumer decisions. The authors study this phenomenon
   across markets with different social orientation cultures to analyze
   potential dissimilarities in the way consumers evaluate and behave
   toward ethically certified products. Findings suggest that fair trade
   certifications enhance product valuations. However, this effect is
   especially observed for low familiar brands, once the level of fair
   trade expertise increases. Findings also suggest that there are
   individual cultural differences with respect to social and environmental
   labeling expertise that may account for some of the unexplained
   variation in choice behaviors observed across countries. Results
   indicate that especially in more (mature) individualistic markets (vs.
   collectivistic) consumer ethical behavior seems to be greatly influenced
   by consumers' perceptions about the eligibility of brands using (or not)
   fair trade. This effect is strengthened by the significant mediating
   role of consumers' ethicality perceptions on the relationship between
   fair trade and the willingness to pay for brands.},

Abstract = {In this article, we address one of the recurrent problems of career
   theory, namely the integration of individual agency and structural
   conditions of action in explanations of career decisions, and through
   them, career trajectories and their outcomes. We draw on Barley's
   suggestion to include scripts as mediating between institutions and
   individual actions. By theoretically specifying scripts as collectively
   shared interpretive schemes that describe successful careers, we are
   able to introduce them as a specific factor that contributes to the
   explanation of career decisions. We demonstrate with a study of German
   early career researchers in two fields how scripts can be empirically
   identified and used in combination with other explanatory factors. Our
   analysis demonstrates how the concept `career script' captures a
   specific social influence on career decisions that is different from
   rules governing behaviour and individual interests, goals and plans for
   a career.},

Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Gatekeepers in financial markets have the power to provide the
   institutional stability, fortitude, and direction necessary for the
   development and the smooth functioning of capital markets. At the same
   time, they are often motivated by their own private incentives. This
   along with the tradeoffs they face, and the at-times unintended
   consequences of the regulations they propose and enforce, can undermine
   their effectiveness. A thorough understanding of gatekeepers and their
   roles can thus illuminate academics, the financial community, and
   regulators on how such gatekeepers can be the most effective and
   generate the greatest benefits for capital markets. Since gatekeeping
   roles and the literature they have inspired encompass a wide array of
   institutions and agencies, our overview concentrates on those that the
   conference papers appearing in this volume focus on. We conclude that
   collectively, the papers contribute to significant progress, and point
   out some crucial areas that call for further investigation and offer
   opportunities for future research.},

   employment. Firms employing many young workers receive a larger tax
   windfall and expand right after the reform: employment, capital, sales,
   and profits increase. These effects appear stronger in
   credit-constrained firms. Youth-intensive firms also increase the wages
   of all their workers collectively, young as well as old, consistent with
   rent sharing of the tax windfall.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT STUDIES},

Volume = {56},
Number = {3, SI},
Pages = {617-654},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Drawing from a participant-observer study of volunteering in the context
   of UK music festivals, we examine how the sense of meaningfulness and
   community relate to instrumental goals of consumption and efficiency. We
   argue that the liminal nature of the festival setting supports an
   ambivalence in which meaningfulness is established through constructions
   of community, while the commodification of community feelings leads to
   heterogeneous understandings of the work setting. Our findings reveal
   heterogeneous ways in which work was rendered meaningful by festival
   volunteers, ranging from (1) A commodity frame, characterizing work as
   drudgery seeking `fun' through consumption (2) A `communitas' frame,
   emphasizing a transcendental sense of collective immediacy and (3) A
   cynical frame, where communitas discourse is used instrumentally by both
   managers and workers. We discuss meaningful work as caught between
   creative community and ideological mystification, and how alternative
   workspaces vacillate between emancipatory principles of solidarity and
   neo-normative forms of ideological control.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {45},
Number = {4},
Pages = {1461-1487},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {This paper introduces a multilevel perspective on the relationships of
   idiosyncratic deals (i-deals) with organizational outcomes (i.e., client
   satisfaction) and investigates how and under which conditions these
   relationships manifest. On the basis of contagion theory, we proposed
   that the positive effects of i-deals will spill over within
   organizational units (indicated by reduced emotional exhaustion and
   enhanced collective commitment), which leads to increased customer
   satisfaction. Moreover, we postulated that the effects of i-deals would
   be more prominent in units with high age diversity, as i-deals are more
   important in units where people's work-related needs are more
   heterogeneous due to the higher diversity in employee age. A study among
   19,780 employees and 17,500 clients of a German public service
   organization showed support for the contagion model and that i-deals
   were negatively related to individual emotional exhaustion and
   subsequently positively related to collective commitment within units
   and client satisfaction measured 6 months later. Emotional exhaustion
   and collective commitment mediated the relationships between i-deals and
   client satisfaction. Finally, we found that the relationships between
   i-deals and emotional exhaustion / client satisfaction were more
   strongly negative in units with high age diversity, rather than in units
   with low age diversity, indicating the benefits of i-deals within units
   with high age diversity to reduce emotional exhaustion and enhance
   client satisfaction.},

Title = {Accounting and passionate interests: The case of a Swedish football club},
Journal = {ACCOUNTING ORGANIZATIONS AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {74},
Pages = {21-40},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {This paper seeks to (re)theorise the interpenetration of accounting and
   emotionality. Whilst researchers have devoted increasing attention to
   the effects of emotions, we argue that extant research is problematic in
   two ways. First, emotions have been treated as an intrapsychological
   phenomenon rather than an inter- or relational phenomenon. Second,
   current work focusses on how accounting produces emotions, failing to
   consider how emotions inform accounting. To address these two
   shortcomings, we mobilise the economic anthropology of Tarde (1902), and
   the subsequent work by Latour and Lepinay (2009) and Latour (2010;
   2013), to argue that all interests are inherently `passionate
   interests'; they are matters that `hook' actors emotionally. This
   theoretical lens is used to narrate a field study considering the
   (changing) passionate interests and their connections to accounting in
   an elite Swedish football club. Specifically, we analyse a nexus of four
   passionate interests that `hook' many (in different ways and with
   different degrees of intensity) - violent behaviour, winning the league,
   preserving the club family, and derbies. More generally, this paper
   argues that: first, organisations are a nexus of passionate interests;
   second, such interests recursively inform the doing of accounting;
   third, passionate interests are quantifiable via a range of financial
   and non-financial performance measures, enabling the construction and
   coordination of collectives; and, fourth, some performance measures
   matter more than others when (a) they are simple and unambiguous, (b)
   grounded in enduring passionate interests with deep historical roots
   that tie together members of proximate communities, and (c) travel
   beyond organisations and penetrate diverse arenas of everyday life,
   reproducing the emotive intensity of passionate interests. Crown

Abstract = {Property is pervasive, and yet we organization scholars rarely discuss
   it. When we do, we think of it as a black-boxed concept to explain other
   phenomena, rather than studying it in its own right. This may be because
   organization scholars tend to limit their understanding of property to
   its legal definition, and emphasize control and exclusion as its
   defining criteria. This essay wishes to crack open the black box of
   property and explore the many ways in which possessive relations are
   established. They are achieved through work, take place as we make sense
   of signs, are invoked into existence in our speech acts, and travel
   along sociomaterial networks. Through a fictionalized account of a
   photographic exhibition, we show that property overflows its usual
   legal-economic definition. Building on the case of the photographic
   exhibit, we show that recognizing the diversity of property changes our
   rapport with organization studies as a field, by unifying its approaches
   to the individual-vs.-collective dilemma. We conclude by noting that if
   theories can make a difference, then whoever controls the assignment of
   property - including academics who ascribe properties to their objects
   of study - decides not only who has or who owns what, but also who or
   what that person or thing can be.},

Title = {Factors that influence the transition of university postdocs to
   non-academic scientific careers: An exploratory study},
Journal = {RESEARCH POLICY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {48},
Number = {3},
Pages = {556-570},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {While postdoctoral fellowships are viewed as positions that prepare PhD
   students for academic careers, studies show that most postdocs will not
   find tenure-track employment within universities. Postdocs consequently
   pursue non-academic jobs that differ in the degree to which they utilize
   a postdoc's scientific training, yet we know little about how this
   occurs. To help address this gap, this study inductively investigates
   factors that may influence a postdoc's transition to a non-academic
   career. The study uncovers multiple individual, PI, as well as
   organizational and policy factors, including the lack of relevant
   skills, absence of support-and in some cases opposition-from their
   principal investigators, and poor availability of non-academic career
   preparation opportunities, among others. Viewed collectively, these
   elements likely hinder a move to non-academic scientific positions and
   thus have consequences for postdoc career trajectories and, by
   extension, the utilization of new knowledge. The paper opens the door
   for future research, theorization, and policy action that might smooth
   the transition of postdocs into non-academic careers and potentially
   improve the impact of publicly-funded research.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF APPLIED PSYCHOLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {104},
Number = {4},
Pages = {581-592},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {The influence of race in negotiations has remained relatively
   underexplored. Across three studies, we theorize and find that Black job
   seekers are expected to negotiate less than their White counterparts and
   are penalized in negotiations with lower salary outcomes when this
   expectation is violated; especially when they negotiate with an
   evaluator who is more racially biased (i.e., higher in social dominance
   orientation). Specifically, on the basis of the prescriptive stereotype
   held by those higher in racial bias-that Black (as compared to White)
   negotiators deserve lower salaries-we predicted that Black negotiators
   who behave in counterstereotypical ways encounter greater resistance and
   more unfavorable outcomes from more biased evaluators. We tested this
   argument in a stepwise fashion: In Study 1, we found that more biased
   evaluators expect Black job seekers to negotiate less as compared to
   White job seekers. When Black negotiators violate those expectations,
   evaluators award them lower starting salaries (Study 2), which appears
   to occur because evaluators become more resistant to making concessions
   to Black than to White job seekers (Study 3). Collectively, our findings
   demonstrate that racially biased perceptual distortions can be used to
   justify the provision of smaller monetary awards for Black job seekers
   in negotiations.},

Abstract = {We introduce the concept of therapeutic servicescapes, defined as
   consumption settings where emplaced, market-mediated performances
   compensate for socio-cultural dilemmas. Our focus is on the localization
   of emotions that are emplaced in specific sociospatial features and
   collectively reproduced through ritualized consumer performances. This
   ethnographic study of religious pilgrimage consumption reveals that the
   therapeutic servicescape comprises three features: evocative spaces,
   ideological homogeneity, and restorative emotion scripts. These
   service-scape features catalyze the consumer rituals of therapeutic
   relations, therapeutic release, and therapeutic renewal. Our
   theorization of therapeutic servicescapes offers three contributions.
   First, we reveal how emotions are socially and geographically
   orchestrated and transformed in marketplace settings. Second, we
   demonstrate how therapeutic ritual performances reproduce emplaced,
   market-mediated emotion and compensate for embodied emotional
   restrictions. Third, we demonstrate how the negotiation of emotional
   ordering guides the therapeutic dialogue between religion and the
   marketplace.},

Abstract = {The dangers of mindless behaviors remain better defined than their
   remedies. Even as mindfulness becomes increasingly prevalent, we lack
   clarity on three key questions: What is mindfulness? How does
   mindfulness training operate? And why might mindfulness matter for
   organizations? In this article I introduce a new conceptualization of
   mindfulness, which I call metacognitive practice. Metacognitive practice
   is so named because it blends insights from metacognition and practice
   theory to answer these three key questions. First, when seen as
   metacognitive practice, mindfulness is not a single mode of information
   processing to be applied in all situations. Instead, it is a
   metacognitive process by which people adjust their mode of information
   processing to their current situation. Second, this metacognitive
   process is made possible by three specific beliefs that supersede lay
   beliefs about human information processing. A core function of
   mindfulness training, thus, is to provide a context that cultivates
   these beliefs. Third, when these beliefs are put into practice, people
   gain greater agency in how they respond to situations. This matters for
   organizations, because as people interrelate their individual actions
   into a collective response, metacognitive practice can get embedded in
   amplifying processes that transform the organization-or in fragmentation
   processes that threaten it.},

Abstract = {Research Summary: We develop a theoretical framework to define the
   comparatively efficient organizational form for dealing with a social
   issue, based on the market frictions associated with it. Specifically,
   we argue that for-profits have an advantage in undertaking innovation
   and coordinating production economies, nonprofits in playing a fiduciary
   role given ex post information asymmetry, self-governing collectives in
   dealing with bounded externalities through private ordering, and state
   bureaucracies in governing general externalities. We build on these
   arguments to develop a mapping between combinations of these market
   frictions and the comparatively efficient arrangements to govern them,
   including a variety of hybrid arrangements such as private-public
   partnerships, social enterprises, corporate social responsibility, and
   so on. Our framework thus contributes to research in strategy,
   organizations, and public policy.
   Managerial Summary: What is the best way to deal with a social problem?
   While some believe such problems are best left to the state, others
   argue that business should take the lead in solving them, or favor
   nonprofit solutions. In this article, we move beyond such
   one-size-fits-all approaches, highlighting the different strengths of
   different organizational forms. We argue that for-profits' strong
   incentives make them more innovative; nonprofits are more trustworthy in
   representing the best interests of others; collectives enable actors to
   self-organize around a common interest; and the state is best for issues
   that impact the entire population. We thus develop a mapping between the
   nature of the social problem and the organizational form-or combination
   of organizational forms- that may deal with it most efficiently.},

Title = {How to Assess the Democratic Qualities of a Multi-stakeholder Initiative
   from a Habermasian Perspective? Deliberative Democracy and the Equator
   Principles Framework},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ETHICS},

Abstract = {The paper presents a renewed Habermasian view on transnational
   multi-stakeholder initiatives (MSIs) and assesses the institutional
   characteristics of the Equator Principles Association (EPA) from a
   deliberative democracy perspective. Habermas' work has been widely
   adopted in the academic literature on the political responsibilities of
   (multinational) corporations (i.e., political corporate social
   responsibility), and also in assessing the democratic qualities of MSIs.
   Commentators, however, have noted that Habermas' approach relies very
   much on `nation-state democracy' and may not be applicable to democracy
   in MSIs-in which nation-states are virtually absent. We argue that
   Habermas' detailed conceptualization of the institutionalization of
   deliberative democracy can be applied to transnational MSIs if these
   initiatives can be said to have their own `de` moi' that can be
   represented in associational decision-making. Therefore, we develop a
   definition of the demos of an MSI based on the notion of collective
   agency. Subsequently, we explain how Habermas' approach to democracy can
   be applied to MSIs and show that it has more to offer than hitherto has
   been uncovered. Our illustrative analysis of the EPA confirms the
   criticisms regarding this MSI which have recently been articulated by
   researchers and practitioners, but also yields new findings and possible
   avenues for the further development of the EPA: That is, although our
   assessment suggests that the EPA in its current state is still far from
   being a democratic MSI, the possibility of a sensible analysis of its
   democratic character indicates that transnational MSIs can, in
   principle, help to fill governance gaps in a democratic way.},

Abstract = {Although diversity provides a greater pool of knowledge and
   perspectives, teams often do not realize the potential offered by these
   additional informational resources. In this study, we develop a new
   model seeking to explain when and how teams that are diverse in terms of
   educational background utilize the afforded informational variety by
   engaging in deeper elaboration of task-relevant information. We found
   that collective team identification moderated the relationship between
   educational team diversity and elaboration of task-relevant information,
   such that under high (low) levels of team identification, educational
   diversity was positively (negatively) related to information
   elaboration. As expected, this moderating effect was shown to be
   mediated simultaneously through two different types of perceived team
   diversity. We found that the negative path was mediated through a
   perceived diversity measure reflecting a split into subgroups, whereas
   the positive path was mediated through a perceived diversity measure
   reflecting perceived educational heterogeneity. Taken together, this
   study contributes to the team diversity literature by shedding light on
   the important role of collective team identification in unlocking the
   potential of objective educational team diversity, by uncovering the
   underlying mechanisms accounting for this effect, and by demonstrating
   the usefulness of distinguishing between different types of perceived
   diversity.},

Abstract = {Academic training, where senior scientists transfer their knowledge and
   skills to junior scientists through apprenticeship, plays a crucial role
   in the development of scientists. This study focuses on two aspects of
   academic training, autonomy and exploration, to investigate how
   different modes of training are incentivized and how they affect junior
   scientists' performance and career prospects. Drawing on a sample of 162
   supervising professors and their 791 PhD students in life science labs
   in Japanese universities, this study suggests two fundamental conflicts
   in academic training. First, autonomy granted to PhD students under
   apprenticeship improves their long-term performance but decreases
   short-term performance. Because the latter effect costs supervisors,
   while the former does not benefit them in general, this inter-temporal
   tradeoff creates an incentive conflict between supervisors and students,
   inducing non-autonomous training. The short-term cost for supervisors
   can be compensated in the form of labor input or reputation gain from
   previous students in the long term, but this typically happens when
   students are trained with limited scope of exploration, which hinders
   the originality of students' knowledge production. This reduces the
   diversity of knowledge production, presenting another incentive conflict
   between individual scientists and the collective scientific community.},

Title = {Fishing in troubled waters? Strategic decision-making and value creation

Journal = {STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT JOURNAL},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {40},
Number = {4, SI},
Pages = {580-603},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Research Summary: Although partnerships have been conceptualized as
   vehicles for value creation, less is known about which partners
   appropriate more value out of them, especially among public
   organizations. We theorize how politics and procedural rationality in
   decisionmaking respectively are associated with value creation and value
   appropriation from partnerships between public organizations. Analysis
   of data from the Dutch water authority sector (2008-2014) shows that
   organizations employing more politics in decision-making appropriate
   more value from horizontal partnerships, whereas procedural rationality
   in decision-making may enhance combined value creation but limits
   partner-level value appropriation. Also as theorized, the collective
   decision-making context constrains value appropriation by partners using
   a discrepant decision-making approach. We discuss implications for
   research on public organizations, alliances, and strategic
   decision-making.
   Managerial Summary: Although much is known about how partnerships can
   create value for firms, we know relatively less about which of the
   partners can appropriate more value from them. In this paper, we
   theorize and find that (public) organizations that employ more politics
   in decision-making can generally appropriate more value from
   partnerships. Organizations that are more procedurally rational, which
   entails the extensive collection and analysis of information to make
   decisions, are able to create more value for the partnership, but
   generally appropriate less value from the partnership. Moreover, an
   organization that has a different decision-making approach than its
   partners' end up appropriating less value from the partnership. Thus,
   when forming partnerships, managers should carefully consider the way
   their potential partners make decisions.},

Abstract = {How do home country institutions influence cross-border postacquisition
   performance? We develop an institutional framework showing that informal
   and formal institutions not only have important individual effects but
   also work together in complex and interesting ways. While collectivism
   and humane orientation (two major informal institutions) can facilitate
   postacquisition integration and firm performance, shareholder
   orientation and property rights protection (two formal institutions)
   constrain postacquisition integration and firm performance. As acquirers
   are simultaneously embedded in their home countries' informal and formal
   institutions, we further hypothesize that the positive effects of
   collectivism and humane orientation can be weakened by incompatible
   formal institutions that hamper postacquisition collaborative efforts.
   We find strong support for our hypotheses in a multilevel analysis of a
   sample of 12,021 cross-border acquisitions involving 43 home and target
   countries between 1995 and 2003.},

Abstract = {Research on transactive memory systems (TMS) has been conducted in a
   variety of teams, a range of task types and increasingly, in settings
   around the world. Despite this proliferation, there has been relative
   inattention to contextual factors that produce TMS and explain
   heterogeneity in the TMS to team performance relationship. TMS studies
   are typically conducted in homogeneous settings (i.e., teams located in
   a single country) and often with sources of potential variation (i.e.,
   environmental volatility, leadership, team human capital, and diversity)
   in TMS development controlled. Collating these individual studies, we
   use meta-analytic techniques to illuminate key contextual factors that
   may shape TMS and influence the TMS-performance association. Using 76
   empirical studies representing 6,869 sampling units, we find that the
   strength of the TMS to performance relationship varies, depending on
   features of the national cultural context-the impact of TMS is stronger
   in cultural contexts where power distance and in-group collectivism are
   higher. Our results also suggest that environmental volatility,
   leadership effectiveness, and team human capital are positively
   associated with TMS, and informational and gender diversity are
   negatively associated with TMS development. Our findings also indicate
   fruitful areas for future research specifically aimed toward
   disentangling the effects of environmental, team, and national cultural
   context on TMS and team performance.},

Title = {Blurred Lines: How the Collectivism Norm Operates Through Perceived
   Group Diversity to Boost or Harm Group Performance in Himalayan Mountain
   Climbing},

Abstract = {We develop a theory explaining how collectivism causes people to
   ``blur{''} demographic differences, that is, to see less diversity than
   actually exists in a group, and reconciling contradictions in how
   collectivistic norms influence group performance. We draw on the
   perceived diversity literature, hypothesizing that collectivistic norms
   cause group members to blur demographic differences, resulting in
   perceptions that group members are more similar than they actually are.
   Whether this benefits or harms group performance depends on the group's
   objective diversity and the relevance of the perceived diversity
   attribute for accomplishing the task. For conjunctive tasks, the group's
   performance is determined by its weakest member, demanding high levels
   of cohesion. Our theory suggests that collectivism benefits group
   conjunctive performance when objective national diversity is high by
   blurring divisive relational differences but has no effect in groups
   with low objective national diversity. In contrast, for disjunctive
   tasks, the group's performance is determined by its best member. We
   predict that collectivism harms group disjunctive performance when
   objective expertness diversity is high by blurring differences in
   task-relevant expertness but has no effect in low objective expertness
   diversity groups. We find support for our theory in two studies, an
   archival study of 5,214 Himalayan climbing expeditions and a laboratory
   experiment assessing 366 groups. Our results show that collectivism has
   benefits and detriments for diverse groups and that these contradictory
   effects can be understood by identifying how the collectivistic blurring
   of perceived group diversity helps or hurts groups based on the type of
   tasks on which they are working.},

Abstract = {The burgeoning of ibusiness firms in the modern digital economy
   challenges the received internationalization theory. Given that
   ibusinesses such as social networking sites create value by providing a
   digital platform for users to interact with one another, we employ a
   user-network perspective and externalization logic, suggesting that
   ibusinesses' internationalization process depends critically on users'
   collective interactions, instead of being solely driven by firms' market
   commitments, as noted by the Uppsala model. However, ibusinesses may
   suffer from liabilities of outsidership due to the boundedness of
   international network effects. Drawing on social network theory, we
   demonstrate that such liabilities can be mitigated by first diffusing
   the ibusiness platform in countries with higher clout. Our analysis
   using a unique dataset of mobile ibusiness platforms finds empirical
   support for the hypotheses. We discuss theoretical implications for the
   network approach of the Uppsala model in the digital era.},

Abstract = {New digital technologies not only support consumers in better fulfilling
   their own consumption needs but also enable them to create greater value
   for other consumers. These new consumer co-production activities,
   collectively referred to as the sharing economy, require firms to
   rethink their role in the marketing value creation process. Firms need
   to define new marketing actions that create value for consumers who are
   also co-producers. To address this challenge, we propose a two-layered
   conceptual framework of consumer co-production networks and the
   individual consumer production journeys therein. These concepts expand
   the traditional production model and consumer journey, respectively,
   explicitly taking into account consumer co-production activities. Within
   the framework, we draw on household production theory combined with
   insights from institutional design theory and consumer behavior research
   to analyze how marketing can support consumers' co-production
   activities. We discuss the managerial and consumer welfare implications
   of our analysis and outline new opportunities for further research.},

Abstract = {Research on psychological safety climate has primarily focused on its
   salutary effects on group risk-taking behaviors. We developed a
   group-level dual-pathway model in which psychological safety climate
   also exerts a simultaneous negative effect on risk-taking behaviors by
   diminishing group average work motivation. In a field survey, we found
   that psychological safety climate was positively related to group
   learning behavior and voice through a reduction in group average fear of
   failure but negatively related to them through a reduction in group
   average work motivation. This dual-pathway model and its mechanisms were
   conceptually replicated in a laboratory experiment with group creativity
   as a different risk-taking behavior. In this experiment, we examined the
   moderating effects of group individualism/collectivism and found that
   psychological safety climate increased the originality and flexibility
   dimensions of group creativity through a reduction in group average fear
   of failure only in groups with a collectivistic orientation and reduced
   the fluency dimension of and time spent on creativity through a
   reduction in group average work motivation only in individualistic
   groups.},

Abstract = {A process network is a complex system of linked unit processes that
   constitute the life cycle of a product. In this article, we consider how
   the structural and functional characteristics of a product's process
   network impact the network's collective greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.
   At a unit process level, GHG emissions are primarily related to process
   efficiency. We hypothesize that a process network's GHG emissions will
   be less when the process network has a modular structure and when its
   constituent unit processes are more functionally similar. A modular
   process network architecture promotes autonomous innovation and
   improvements in knowledge management and problem-solving capabilities,
   leading to more efficient processes. Functional commonality in a process
   network enables economies of scale and knowledge spillover and also
   leads to process efficiencies, thus reducing GHG emissions. We test
   these two hypotheses using a sample of 4,189 process networks extracted
   from an environmental life cycle inventory database. Empirical results
   support our hypotheses, and we discuss the implications of our findings
   for product development and supply network design.},

Abstract = {In most corporate settings, leaders are expected to inspire and direct
   employees leading is something they do to followers. But in professional
   service firms, the situation is different. These firms tend to be full
   of powerful, opinionated experts who prize their autonomy. They don't
   easily accept the rote of follower and may be just as unwilling to act
   as leaders. A leader's authority is contingent upon their consent, which
   can be quickly withdrawn. In this context, leadership has to be a
   collective, not an individual, endeavor. It requires a grasp of three
   key dynamics:
   Establishing legitimacy. To be accepted by their peers, leaders have to
   keep demonstrating an ability to generate revenue.
   Maneuvering politically. Achieving consensus requires social astuteness
   and networking skill, and peers must believe the leader is acting in
   their interests.
   Negotiating perpetually. To strike a balance between asserting control
   and giving peers autonomy, leaders must always negotiate.
   These dynamics are both in flux and interconnected, and leaders have to
   constantly manage them.

Abstract = {There is growing concern that a global economic system fueled
   predominately by financial incentives may not maximize human flourishing
   and social welfare externalities. If so, this presents a challenge of
   how to get economic actors to adopt a more virtuous motivational
   mindset. Relying on historical, psychological, and philosophical
   research, we show how such a mindset can be instilled. First, we
   demonstrate that historically, financial self-interest has never in fact
   been the only guiding motive behind free markets, but that markets
   themselves are representations of our individual and collective moral
   identities. Building on this understanding, we review the research on
   how economic incentives crowd out virtue-oriented concerns. We then
   introduce the concept of moral self-awareness (MSA), an evolving mindset
   informed by reflection on moral identity, namely what one's actions say
   about oneself given the impacts (positive or negative) on others or
   society that one's action may effect. MSA comprises three fundamental
   aspects of virtue-oriented reasoning: pride, shame, and guilt. Finally,
   we offer a four-stage model anchored in systems theory, yielding ever
   more refined motivating strategies for maximizing human flourishing and
   social welfare externalities.},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {We provide the first large-scale empirical evidence of banks functioning
   as tax planning intermediaries. We posit that some banks specialize in
   assisting corporate clients with tax planning. In this role, banks make
   use of their centrality in financial relationships; access to private
   information; and ability to structure, execute, and participate in tax
   planning transactions for clients. We measure bank-client relationships
   using loan contracts and measure client tax planning using either the
   cash effective tax rate or the unrecognized tax benefit balance. Using a
   difference-in-differences design, we find that firms experience
   meaningful tax reductions when they begin a relationship with a bank
   whose existing clients engage in above-median tax planning. The effects
   of pairing with such tax intermediary banks are concentrated in
   relationships with larger or longer maturity loans, clients with foreign
   income or greater credit risk, and when the bank is an industry
   specialist or has above-median investment banking activities. Finally,
   we find that potential clients are more likely to choose tax
   intermediary banks than nontax intermediary banks, suggesting that tax
   intermediary banks benefit by attracting new business. Collectively, our
   results suggest that some banks act as tax planning intermediaries, a
   role beyond the traditional one of financial intermediary.},

Journal = {ADMINISTRATIVE SCIENCE QUARTERLY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {64},
Number = {1},
Pages = {203-229},

Abstract = {We examine changes in the effectiveness of local civic action in
   relation to changes over time in racial diversity and income inequality.
   Local civic action comprises situations in which community members come
   together-typically with support from local organizations-to address
   common issues. The collective orientation of local civic action makes it
   sensitive to changes in local social conditions. As these changes
   unfold, local organizations become differentially able to support civic
   action. Here, our core argument features the process through which
   community members associate with different local organizations and how
   mandated versus voluntary association results in distinct responses to
   increased social and economic heterogeneity. We test this argument using
   three decades of data describing local campaigns of the annual
   Trick-or-Treat for UNICEF program. A baseline model shows that
   within-county increases in racial diversity and income inequality are
   associated with diminished campaign effectiveness. Subsequent models
   that separate out campaigns organized by schools, churches, and clubs
   show that schools are relatively more effective mobilizers as racial
   diversity and income inequality increase, arguably due to the greater
   demographic matching that is induced by mandated school participation.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {45},
Number = {3},
Pages = {1145-1172},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {An emerging body of research examines collective human capital flow via
   context-emergent turnover (CET) theory, which builds on resource-based
   theory and the literature on human capital. CET theory indicates that
   collective human capital flow-or employee movement into and out of
   organizations-is of growing significance to scholars and practitioners
   given the effects that it has on important organizational outcomes. Yet,
   a better understanding of what drives systematic variance in collective
   outflows and inflows is needed so that employers can strategize and plan
   ways to manage human capital flow. We use CET theory to highlight the
   role of a firm's reputation as an antecedent to human capital flow.
   Moreover, because CET theory emphasizes the significance of context, we
   consider how labor market conditions change the nature of these
   relationships. We predict and find that a positive reputation helps
   employers reduce several types of collective human capital flow, yet
   more reputable employers are better able to do so in slack, rather than
   tight, labor markets. These results shed light on the importance of
   context on collective human capital flow and indicate the potential of
   CET theory to understand not only the consequences but also the drivers
   of collective movement in and out of organizations.},

Volume = {43},

Pages = {185+},

Abstract = {There is substantial knowledge about how individuals and organizations,
   which we refer to collectively as entities, adopt and use new channels.
   However, less is known about how this relates to their use of the
   incumbent channel that the new channel may replace. To address this gap,
   we examine how entities transition between incumbent and new channels
   over time, with a particular focus on two temporal factors: when an
   entity adopts the new channel and how long an entity has used the
   channels, which we refer to as the entity's channel history. Our results
   show that entities that adopt at similar times often follow dramatically
   different patterns of new and incumbent channel use. This allows us to
   expand upon the traditional adopter categories of innovators, early
   adopters, early majority, late majority, and laggards. We also find that
   an entity's channel history influences how it transitions between the
   incumbent and new channels, and we document other factors that influence
   these transitions. Our results contribute to theory about the
   adoption/diffusion of new channels, and they contribute to practice by
   giving managers tools to understand and predict how entities' use of new
   and incumbent channels evolves over time.},

Abstract = {Multinational enterprises (MNEs) sometimes pursue opportunities in
   largely uncharted, distinctive institutional environments. How do these
   firms sustain operations in such settings? We explore how MNEs tailor
   and maintain operations in institutionally weak, precarious, and
   challenging host-country environments, such as those devastated by
   conflicts. We draw on the business ecosystem framework and analyze a
   qualitative longitudinal case study of a Chinese state-owned MNE that
   entered and developed its operations in the Democratic Republic of Congo
   (DRC) in Central Africa. Our findings indicate that after entry, the MNE
   sustained its operations in the DRC by engaging in collective actions
   and coevolving with key stakeholders within its business ecosystem.
   These stakeholders included the home and host governments, state-owned
   enterprises, privately owned enterprises, and local communities. Our
   qualitative data further suggest that the MNE's business ecosystem
   evolved through three stages-exploring, establishing, and embedding-and
   that within this ecosystem, the key stakeholders also coevolved with the
   MNE by adopting new roles over time.},

Abstract = {Although there is a growing interest toward the topic of leader
   humility, extant research has largely failed to consider the underlying
   mechanisms through which leader humility influences team outcomes. In
   this research, we integrate the emerging literature of leader humility
   and social information processing theory to theorize how leader humility
   facilitates the development of collective team psychological capital,
   leading to higher team task allocation effectiveness and team
   performance. While Owens and Hekman (2016) suggest that leader humility
   has homogeneous effects on followers, we propose a potential
   heterogeneous effect based on the complementarity literature (e.g.,
   Tiedens, Unzueta, \& Young, 2007) and the principle of equifinality
   (leaders may influence team outcomes through multiple pathways;
   Morgeson, DeRue, \& Karam, 2010). In three studies conducted in China,
   Singapore, and Portugal, including an experiment, a multisource field
   study, and a three-wave multisource field study, we find support for our
   hypotheses that leader humility enhances team performance serially
   through increased team psychological capital and team task allocation
   effectiveness. We discuss the theoretical implications of our work to
   the leader humility, psychological capital, and team effectiveness
   literatures; and offer suggestions for future research.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we explore whether perceivers can accurately assess the
   effectiveness of groups, how perceivers use group properties to inform
   their judgement, and the contextual and individual differences that
   allow some perceivers to be more accurate. Across seven studies, we
   present consistent evidence that perceivers can judge workgroup
   effectiveness in videos of different lengths-60, 30, and 10 s and in
   10-second silent videos and 10 second audio clips. We find that
   perceptions of collective properties of groups, including cohesion,
   affective trust, and cognitive trust partially mediate perceivers'
   ability to accurately judge groups. Furthermore, increased attentional
   focus improves perceivers' ability to judge group effectiveness.
   Finally, we find that perceivers with higher levels of social
   sensitivity are more accurate at judging group effectiveness. We discuss
   the implications of these findings for the groups literature and social
   perception literature.},

Title = {Contested compliance regimes in global production networks: Insights

Journal = {HUMAN RELATIONS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {72},
Number = {2},
Pages = {272-297},

Abstract = {This article reports the findings of a field study on the emergence of
   collective agreements led by global brands enacting compliance measures
   to improve safety and working conditions in the Bangladesh garment
   industry. We explore how key actors in the Bangladesh garment sector who
   constitute the local production system of the global supply chain
   experienced the implementation of global agreements on factory safety.
   We argue that global safety compliance measures through
   multi-stakeholder initiatives provide legitimacy to multinational
   corporations and their global brands but do little to address the
   structural problems arising from exploitative pricing and procurement
   practices, which are the key reasons for deplorable working conditions
   in garment factories. Our findings indicate that neoliberal development
   policies of the state, where local economies are incorporated into
   global production networks, resulted in differential treatment and
   regulation of specific populations that comprise garment factory
   workers. The reconfiguration of state power to meet the demands of
   global supply chains also involved use of state violence to suppress
   dissent while undermining labour rights and working conditions. Our
   article contributes to the politicization of multinational corporations
   in global production chains by showing how contestations between
   workers, factory owners, the state, trade unions and multinational
   corporations create new private forms of governance and new regimes of
   compliance in the industry.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF APPLIED PSYCHOLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {104},
Number = {2},
Pages = {293-302},

Abstract = {The ability to detect differences between groups partially impacts how
   useful a group-level variable will be for subsequent analyses. Direct
   consensus and referent-shift consensus group-level constructs are often
   measured by aggregating group member responses to multi-item scales. We
   show that current measurement validation practice for these group-level
   constructs may not be optimized with respect to differentiating groups.
   More specifically, a 10-year review of multilevel articles in top
   journals reveals that multilevel measurement validation primarily relies
   on procedures designed for individual-level constructs. These procedures
   likely miss important information about how well each specific scale
   item differentiates between groups. We propose that group-level
   measurement validation be augmented with information about each scale
   item's ability to differentiate groups. Using previously published
   datasets, we demonstrate how ICC(1) estimates for each item of a scale
   provide unique information and can produce group-level scales with
   higher ICC(1) values that enhance predictive validity. We recommend that
   researchers supplement conventional measurement validation information
   with information item-level ICC(1) values when developing or modifying
   scales to assess group-level constructs.},

Abstract = {Employee matching grant schemes are coordination mechanisms that reduce
   free-riding by socially conscious employee-donors. Matching schemes
   coupled with lower take-home pay than offered by non-matching firms will
   survive capital and labor market competition if employee type is not
   observable and socially conscious employees are more productive or value
   working together. Matching can enhance employee welfare and raise more
   for charity without reducing profits. We document that matching firms
   have higher labor productivity and are more likely to be ranked as one
   of the ``100 Best{''} employers. The result is robust to managerial
   entrenchment concerns and is not confined to the high-tech sector.},

Abstract = {The mass migration of refugees in the fall of 2015 in Europe posed an
   immense humanitarian and logistical challenge: exhausted from their
   week-long journeys, refugees arrived in Vienna in need of care, shelter,
   food, medical aid, and onward transport. The refugee crisis was managed
   by an emerging polycentric and intersectoral collective of
   organizations. In this paper, we investigate how leaders of these
   organizations made decisions in concert with each other and hence
   sustained the capacity to act as collective. We ask: what was the logic
   of decision-making that orchestrated collective action during the
   crisis? In answering this question, we make the following contribution:
   departing from March's logics of consequences and appropriateness as
   well as Weick's work on sensemaking during crisis, we introduce an
   alternative logic that informed decision-making in our study: the logic
   of tact. With this concept (a) we offer a better understanding of how
   managers may make decisions under the condition of bounded rationality
   and the simultaneous transgression of their institutional identity in
   situations of crisis; and (b) we show that in decision-making under
   extreme pressure cognition is neither ahead of action, nor is action
   ahead of cognition; rather, tact explicates the rapid switching between
   cognition and action, orchestrating decision-making through their
   interplay.},

Abstract = {The increased reliance on interorganizational collaborations (ICs) has
   created new challenges for leaders. They must attempt to apply
   leadership theories and behaviors developed primarily for leading within
   one organization or group to leading collaborations of multiple
   organizations and stakeholders. To provide insight into this issue, this
   study examines leadership behavior in an IC developing a strategic plan
   to promote changes to address public health and safety concerns related
   to substance abuse. Combining observations and interviews, we followed a
   statewide interagency taskforce in a southwestern state of the United
   States from its inception through completion of its strategic plan
   within a 10-month deadline. Findings show different leadership behaviors
   were integrated and evolved over time to strike a balance between
   decision-making effectiveness and efficiency. In particular, the
   findings support recent research on examining leadership behavior
   holistically to develop a `fuller full-range' leadership perspective
   (Antonakis and House, 2014), especially in terms of how collectivistic
   and instrumental leadership should complement transformational
   leadership, and by demonstrating that the combinations of leadership
   change over time and occur at multiple levels. These findings provide
   guidance for future practice and research on ICs promoting change.},

Abstract = {Although much work has been done on Kant's theory of moral agency,
   little explored is the possibility of a Kantian account of the moral
   agency of groups or collectives that comprise individual human beings.
   The aim of this paper is to offer a Kantian account of collective moral
   agency that can explain how organized collectives can perform moral (or
   immoral) actions and be held morally responsible for their actions.
   Drawing on Kant's view that agents act by incorporating an incentive
   into their maxims, it is argued that groups of agents can engage in
   practical deliberation in much the same way individual agents can,
   resulting in the formulation of a distinctive group maxim for which the
   group, as such, can be morally responsible.},

Abstract = {We explore how decision makers perceive and assess the level of risk in
   interdependent settings. In a series of five experiments, we examine how
   individuals set expectations for their own project investments when
   their success is contingent on the success of multiple, independent
   partners. We find that individuals are subjectively more confident and
   optimistic in an interdependent venture when its chances of success are
   presented as separate probabilities for each component and that this
   optimism is exacerbated by a greater number of critical partners,
   leading to (1) the inflation of project valuations, (2) the addition of
   excessive partners to a project, and (3) overinvestment of effort in the
   development of one's own component within an interdependent venture. We
   examine these dynamics in settings of risky choice (with exogenously
   given probabilities) and in an economic coordination game (with the
   ambiguity of agency and strategic risk). We conduct our study with awide
   range of participant samples ranging from undergraduates to senior
   executives. Collectively, our findings hold important implications for
   the ways in which individuals, organizations, and policymakers should
   approach and assess their innovation choices in ecosystem settings.},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Vacation Timeshare is a form of ownership or ``right to use{''} of a
   resort property for a specific time period (typically a week) each year.
   Timeshare exchange refers to the non-monetary trading of timeshare weeks
   among owners, so that they can interchange their vacation homes to
   experience new destinations. The need for member participation during
   the exchange process has been well-recognized for a variety of practical
   reasons, including the reluctance of members to accept an authoritarian
   solution that does not provide any information about the exchange
   process and their desire to experience some control over the process.
   Another important need is to ensure that, given the members'
   preferences, an exchange solution offers collectively the best-possible
   improvement over their currently-owned weeks, while being ``fair{''} to
   all participants. We suggest two objectives to capture the efficiency
   and fairness of an exchange solution. For the resulting bi-criteria
   problem, we show that a solution that is simultaneously near-optimal on
   both objectives may not exist. Our main contribution is an efficient
   algorithm in which (i) each member uses her private preference list to
   communicate with other members, and the members, through such
   communications, collectively achieve an individually rational
   allocation, and (ii) for any desired approximation bounds alpha and beta
   on, respectively, efficiency and fairness, the following property holds:
   if an (alpha, beta)-approximate solution exists, then the solution
   provided by the algorithm satisfies this approximation guarantee;
   otherwise, the solution is an alpha-approximation on the efficiency
   measure and, among all such allocations, has the best fairness measure.},

Year = {2019},
Volume = {29},
Number = {1},
Pages = {130-141},
Month = {JAN-MAR},
Abstract = {Consumers with stigmatized identities may be especially attentive to
   organizational cues that signal to them whether or not they are welcomed
   and valued consumers. These stigmatized-identity cues can become a part
   of a company's brand, influencing the attractiveness of the company and
   consumer loyalty, and allowing consumers to draw inferences about an
   organization's ideologies and attitudes toward multiple stigmatized
   groups. Consumers with stigmatized identities attend to
   stigmatized-identity cues that signal inclusion (or exclusion) toward
   other stigmatized groups, resulting in stigmatized-identity cue
   transfers, especially when similarity mindsets are activated, and among
   consumers who are high in stigma solidarity. Because identity is central
   in consumer behavior, stigmatized-identity threat cues can at times
   result in anti-consumption, including boycotts, allowing consumers and
   companies to engage in collective action. This article reviews this
   growing body of research, demonstrating the important influence of
   stigmatized-identity cues on consumer behavior and discussing ways in
   which companies can better signal their inclusive attitudes and
   ideologies to attract consumers.},

Abstract = {Drawing upon positive psychology and a social relational perspective,
   this article examines the relationship between well-being-oriented human
   resource management (HRM) practices and employee performance. Our
   multilevel model examines relationships among collectively experienced
   well-being-oriented HRM practices, social climate (characterized by
   trust, cooperation, and shared codes and language that exist among
   individuals within the organization), employee resilience, and employee
   (in-role) performance. Based on the two-wave data obtained from 561
   employees and their managers within 62 bank branches in 16 Chinese
   banks, our multilevel analyses provide support for our four hypotheses.
   First, we found a positive relationship between well-being-oriented HRM
   practices and social climate. Second, social climate mediated the
   relationship between well-being-oriented HRM practices and employee
   resilience. Third, we found a positive relationship between resilience
   and employee performance. Finally, employee resilience mediated the
   relationship between social climate and employee performance. This study
   is one of the first to unpack the social mechanisms through which
   well-being-oriented HRM practices increase development of resilience and
   subsequent employee performance at the workplace, namely through
   influencing group feelings of social climate.},

Abstract = {An empirical approach to optimal income taxation design is developed
   within an equilibrium collective marriage market model with imperfectly
   transferable utility. Taxes distort time allocation decisions, as well
   as marriage market outcomes, and the within household decision process.
   Using data from the American Community Survey and American Time Use
   Survey, we structurally estimate our model and explore empirical design
   problems. We allow taxes to depend upon marital status, with the form of
   tax jointness for married couples unrestricted. We find that the optimal
   tax system for married couples is characterized by negative jointness,
   although the welfare gains from jointness are modest. These welfare
   gains are then shown to be increasing in the gender wage gap, with taxes
   here, as in the case of gender based taxation, providing an instrument
   to address within household inequality.},

Title = {The Impact of Organizational Performance on the Emergence of Asian

Journal = {JOURNAL OF APPLIED PSYCHOLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {104},
Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {107-122},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Despite remarkably high levels of education and income, Asian Americans
   remain underrepresented at the top of the organizational hierarchy.
   Existing work suggests that a mismatch between the prototypical
   characteristics of business leaders (e.g., dominance) and stereotypes
   associated with Asian Americans (e.g., submissiveness) lowers the
   likelihood that Asian Americans will emerge as leaders. We predict that
   this reluctance to appoint Asian Americans will be attenuated when
   organizations experience performance decline because decision makers
   believe Asian Americans are inclined to sacrifice their self-interest to
   improve the welfare of others. We found support for these predictions
   using a multimethod approach. In an archival study of 4,951 CEOs across
   five decades, we find that Asian Americans were appointed almost
   two-and-a-half times more often during decline than nondecline (Study
   1). Then, in three studies, we show that this pattern occurs because
   evaluators (a) prefer self-sacrificing leaders more when organizations
   are experiencing decline than success (Study 2); (b) expect Asian
   Americans leaders to behave in self-sacrificing ways in general (Study
   3); and, consequently, (c) perceive that Asian Americans are better
   equipped to be leaders during decline than success (Study 4). We
   consider these findings in tandem with a set of exploratory analyses.
   This includes our finding that organizations experience decline only
   12\% of the time, suggesting that evaluators deem Asian Americans to be
   suitable leaders in circumstances that occur infrequently and are
   short-lived.},

Volume = {44},
Number = {1},

Abstract = {Working parents often contend with how to effectively portray themselves
   as both devoted professionals and good parents. In this article we
   introduce the construct ``work-family image{''} as a cross-domain,
   collective image representing how competent an individual is perceived
   to be as a parent and a professional by key constituents in both work
   and life domains. We present a theoretical framework to explicate a
   process in which work-family image management drives work-family
   identity adaptation. Specifically, we suggest that work-family image
   management occurs when work-family norms, derived from societal,
   organizational, and familial expectations, create image discrepancies
   that drive impression management behavior. These behaviors, in turn, can
   create image-identity asymmetries and lead to work-family identity
   adaptation. We contribute to existing research by highlighting the
   dynamic interplay between image management and identity adaptation and
   explain the process by which work-family norms can influence working
   parents' identities.},

Abstract = {Research on the work-life interface has exploded over the past five
   decades because of trends in the nature of gender roles, families, work,

   offer a corrective by developing new theory to make sense of the
   research to date and to guide future research. The six articles in this
   forum make substantial contributions to work-life theory individually
   and collectively. They provide useful guidance for future work-life
   theory and research from multiple theoretical perspectives that vary in
   their level of analysis and in their focus on decision making,
   diversity, and temporal dynamics. In addition, these six articles offer
   innovative implications for practice by employees, couples, supervisors,

Volume = {72},
Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {23-47},

Abstract = {This article critically examines a 21st century online, social movement,
   the Everyday Sexism Project (referred to as the ESP), to analyse
   resistance against sexism that is systemic, entrenched and
   institutionalized in society, including organizations. Our motivating
   questions are: what new forms of feminist organizing are developing to
   resist sexism and what are the implications of thinking
   ethico-politically about feminist resistance that has the goals of
   social justice, equality and fairness? Reading the ESP in this way leads
   to a conceptualization of how infrapolitical feminist resistance emerges
   at grassroots level and between individuals in the form of affective
   solidarity, which become necessary in challenging neoliberal threats to
   women's opportunity and equality. Our contribution conceptualizes
   affective solidarity as central to this feminist resistance against
   sexism and involves two modes of feminist organizing: the politics of
   experience and empathy. By addressing the ethical and political demands
   of solidarity we can build resurgent, politically vibrant feminist
   organizing and resistance that mobilizes feminist consciousness and
   builds momentum for change. Our conclusion is that an ethico-politics of
   feminist resistance moves away from individualizing experiences of
   sexism towards collective resistance and organizes solidarity,
   experience and empathy that may combat ignorance and violence towards
   women.},

Abstract = {The emergent `uses of the past' literature challenges traditional
   perspectives on history as an objective constraint for organizational
   action. It does so by putting forward an interpretivist view that
   highlights the moulding and shaping of history as a resource that
   enables action. We build upon and extend this approach by demonstrating
   how a more explicit attention to materiality reveals `the dual nature of
   the past' as not simply constraining and/or enabling but also actively
   orienting organizational action in the present. We draw upon research on
   organizational remembering and the concept of affordance to theorize the
   entanglement of organizational remembering and the material technologies
   of memory. We examine the dynamics of organizational remembering and
   materiality in the context of the British Museum's digitization efforts.
   We show how narratives about the past enable organizational actors to
   make sense of and repurpose a novel material technology of memory
   (computers) through the construction of affordances. However, we also
   demonstrate how the materiality of objects inherited from the past also
   actively constrained and oriented how actors worked upon various
   obstacles on the path to digitization. We make two contributions. First,
   we develop how the dual nature of the past constitutes a novel way to
   reconcile deterministic and voluntarist interpretations of the past in
   organizations by assigning a more active role to material objects in
   organizational remembering. Second, we introduce a novel way to theorize
   organizational memory as an ongoing process of mutual constitution
   between technologies of memory (Speicher) and social practices of

Title = {Prepopulating Audit Workpapers with Prior Year Assessments: Default
   Option Effects on Risk Rating Accuracy},

Volume = {56},
Number = {5},
Pages = {1453-1481},

Abstract = {Risk assessment is a critical audit task, as auditors' accuracy therein
   affects audit effectiveness and financial reporting quality, as well as
   audit efficiency. We propose that risk assessment accuracy for client
   risks that have changed from the prior year is affected by the manner in
   which auditors access prior year risk assessments, specifically whether
   they face a default option created by the prepopulation of current year
   workpapers with those assessments. We find that auditors with
   prepopulated (vs. blank) workpapers are less accurate for risks that
   have changed because they are more likely to stick with last year's
   assessments, and also to work fast. We then show that auditor
   characteristics reflecting a preference for accuracy reduce, but do not
   eliminate, these effects. Finally, we provide exploratory evidence that
   sticking and working fast are associated with, respectively, motivated
   reasoning and superficial processing. Collectively, these findings
   suggest the critical need for an intervention, and also have
   implications outside auditing.},

Abstract = {Though employee identification with customers has received little
   explicit attention in organizational scholarship, and has only recently
   emerged as an area of focus in marketing, research suggests that
   customers should play a central role in the identity dynamics of
   employees. What makes employee-customer identification different from
   other forms of identification (e.g., employee-organization and
   customer-organization identification) is that although the organization
   may be the conduit for identification to occur, it may not be the focus
   of identification. Indeed, in the organization we explore here,
   organizational practices lead employees to identify with customers, but
   to do so in such a way that employees become-at least in part-more like
   ``who they served{''} than vice versa. Moreover, the bonds we find
   between employees and customers are multilayered, incorporating nonwork
   identities, as well as identities at different levels of inclusiveness
   (e.g., collective and role). This paper explores and models the
   development and consequences of multilayered employee-customer
   identification, argues for its theoretical and practical implications,
   and suggests avenues for future research.},

Abstract = {The United Kingdom has recently required an expanded auditor's report
   for large public companies. We investigate whether this requirement is
   associated with an increase in the decision usefulness of the auditor's
   report and whether it has indirect consequences on audit fees and
   quality. Our analyses cover four years surrounding the changes,
   including companies that transitioned to the new regime and companies
   that continued issuing the previous report's format. We do not find
   evidence that the regulatory change significantly affected investors'
   reaction to the release of auditors' reports, audit fees, or audit
   quality. Furthermore, we do not find that variation in the expanded
   reports' content has affected these outcomes. Although companies with
   long reports pay comparatively higher fees, the mere increase in
   disclosure does not affect audit fees or quality. Collectively, our
   evidence is consistent with the expanded auditor's report providing
   little incremental information to investors.},

Abstract = {Despite a wealth of research on competitive and cooperative strategy,
   gaps remain with respect to how firms successfully navigate cooperation
   and competition over time. This is especially true in ecosystems, in
   which firms depend on one another to collectively provide components and
   create value for consumers. Through an in-depth multiple case study of
   five firms in the U.S. residential solar industry from 2007 to 2014, we
   induct a theoretical framework that explains how firms navigate nascent
   ecosystems over time. We identify three strategies, each with a distinct
   balance of cooperation and competition, as well as unique advantages,
   disadvantages, and required capabilities. Overall, we contribute to
   research on ecosystem strategy, crystallize the pivotal role of
   bottlenecks, and shed light on the dynamic interplay of cooperation and
   competition.
   Competition and cooperation are fundamental to strategy, and often
   closely intertwined. But how firms navigate and balance cooperation and
   competition over time, especially in ecosystems where firms depend on
   one another to deliver value to consumers, is unclear. In this article,
   we conduct an in-depth multiple-case study of five firms in the U.S.
   residential solar industry to examine how firms can successfully
   navigate nascent ecosystems over time. We identify three distinct
   strategies, each with a distinct balance of cooperation and competition,
   and examine the unique advantages, disadvantages, and required
   capabilities of each. In doing so, we also contribute novel insights
   into the evolution of ecosystems and bottlenecks.},

Title = {A NETWORK VIEW OF ADVICE-GIVING AND INDIVIDUAL CREATIVITY IN TEAMS: A
   BROKERAGE-DRIVEN, SOCIALLY PERPETUATED PHENOMENON},
Journal = {ACADEMY OF MANAGEMENT JOURNAL},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {61},
Number = {6},
Pages = {2210-2229},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {One potential benefit of team contexts is that members can share
   knowledge and ideas to help one another solve problems (e.g.,
   advice-giving), thereby enhancing members' creative potential. However,
   individuals' advice-giving actions do not guarantee increases in
   recipients' creativity and, in some cases, may even be a creative
   liability for the giver's own subsequent creativity. We argue that
   considering advice givers' brokerage in the team's advice-giving network
   (i.e., advice brokerage) may clarify this phenomenon. Specifically, we
   posit that advice given from a brokerage position contains more
   nonredundant content that boosts recipients' creativity. Further, we
   expect advice brokerage to positively influence a giver's own
   creativity, though this effect is at least partially explained via
   recipients' proximal creativity gains (e.g., recipients' creativity
   change mediates the relationship). Recipients' perceptions of
   psychological safety accentuate these relationships. Longitudinal field
   data support the main hypotheses, but also suggest that advice brokerage
   has more immediate proximal effects on givers' creativity; an additional
   qualitative study elucidates several mechanisms by which brokered advice
   boosts creativity, including two associated with generating diverse
   ideas (idea integration, perspective-taking), two associated with
   domain-specific knowledge accumulation (knowledge accumulation,
   reflection), collective creativity, and creative feedback. The study
   yields several important implications.},

Title = {An identity perspective on coopetition in the craft beer industry},

Abstract = {To further our understanding of how and why organizations engage in
   coopetition, we explore cooperative and competitive actions in the craft
   beer industry. Through an inductive field study, including interviews
   with craft brewery owners, we propose collective identity and collective
   norms play a critical role in the persistence of coopetition over time.
   Our process model suggests that (a) an oppositional collective identity,
   (b) the shared belief that a rising tide lifts all boats, and (c) the
   shared belief that advice and assistance should be paid forward, can
   lead to the persistence of coopetition beyond market category emergence.
   This paper develops a theory of how smaller, craft-based organizations
   (i.e., ``Davids{''}) encourage cohesion and cooperation amongst
   themselves when operating against an incumbent market of mass-producers
   (i.e., ``Goliaths{''}). An ideological opposition to existing players
   can lead to a shared belief that helping organizations like your own
   benefits everyone-the rising tide lifts all boats mentality. Similarly,
   when organizations first enter a market and receive help from
   established members, they can feel compelled to help others who enter
   the market after-the pay-it-forward mentality. Together, these
   mechanisms offer an explanation as to how and why coopetition might
   persist in a market category over time.},

Volume = {23},

Abstract = {SEC comment letters indicate that the SEC has reviewed the firm's
   filings and identified a disclosure issue. Using the existence of an SEC
   comment letter as a proxy for SEC monitoring, we document a negative
   association between the level of SEC monitoring of foreign firms and the
   strength of those foreign firms' home-country institutions, consistent
   with the idea that the SEC implicitly shares its regulatory duties with
   international securities regulators. We find that foreign cross-listed
   firms are subject to lower monitoring intensity than foreign firms
   listed only on US exchanges, but do not find a statistically significant
   difference in monitoring between foreign firms listed only on US
   exchanges and US firms. These findings suggest that it is the presence
   of another regulator that drives the intensity of SEC monitoring. We
   also find that US investor holdings are positively associated with the
   level of SEC oversight, suggesting that the SEC focuses its resources on
   firms that pose a greater risk to US investors. Collectively, our
   analyses show that two countervailing forces drive the SEC's choice to
   monitor foreign firms. On the one hand, the SEC reduces monitoring
   intensity when it can rely on the public and private enforcement
   institutions in the foreign firm's home country. On the other hand, the
   SEC provides increased monitoring of certain foreign firms when
   investors on US exchanges have greater investment exposure in those
   firms.},

Abstract = {As the nature of information systems (IS) has evolved from primarily
   standalone, to enterprise, and distributed applications, the need for a
   better understanding of collective IS use has become a research and
   practical necessity. In view of contributing to this understanding, we
   conceptually define collective IS use as a unit level construct, rooted
   in instances of individual-level IS use within the context of a common
   work process. Its emergence from the individual to the unit level is
   shaped by different configurations of task, user, and system
   interdependence between instances of individual-level IS use. On the
   basis of this definition, we propose a typology of collective IS use
   that comprises four ideal types, namely siloed use, processual use,
   coalesced use, and networked use. For each ideal type, we theorize on
   the emergence process from the individual to the unit level and we
   consider the measurement implications for each.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT STUDIES},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {55},
Number = {8},
Pages = {1507-1526},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Paradox theory enables management research to replace either/or thinking
   with more integrative both/and approaches. Despite this achievement,
   greater theoretical complexity is needed to account for paradoxical
   tensions' intricacies. We use dialectics theory to unpack the learning
   processes through which organizational members and collectives build
   their capacity to understand and cope with complex tensions over time.
   Building on these insights, we develop a paradox process model that
   resembles a learning spiral, in which organizations move through stages
   of convergence and divergence. During the convergence stages, they learn
   about and refine their current worldviews by constantly moving between
   the tension's poles. During the divergence stages, they move beyond
   dynamic equilibrium to reach a higher understanding of tensions and
   their management. While organizations caught in equilibrium are prone to
   stasis and demise, those that move beyond equilibrium can achieve
   sustainability.},

Abstract = {We use a field experiment in Sierra Leone to examine how the identity of
   the manager influences rent seeking and performance in participatory
   development projects. Specifically, we vary the composition of a
   committee responsible for implementing a development project-local
   elites or randomly selected villagers. The design is unique in that it
   permits us to explore the effectiveness of two alternative local
   governance modalities and the extent of elite capture in community
   projects. We find little evidence that local elites capture project
   resources. We do observe they are better managers of development
   projects. Improved performance covaries with a proxy for power of the
   local chief.},

Abstract = {Research on the ``uses of the past{''} in organizations and organizing
   is flourishing. This introduction reviews this approach to integrating
   history into organization studies and explores its paths forward. We
   begin by examining the intellectual origins of the approach and by
   defining why and how it matters to the study of management and
   organizations. Specifically, we emphasize the performative role of
   history in making and unmaking organizational orders. Next, we elaborate
   on how the articles in the special issue demonstrate the uses of the
   past in shaping organizational identity, strategy, and power. We also
   highlight how this work contributes to our understanding of the socially
   embedded character of history in organizations by accounting for the
   role of materiality, intertextuality, competing narratives, practices,
   and audiences in how the past is used. We conclude by considering four
   research frontiers particularly worthy of further exploration-the
   influence of temporal form, the role of non-rational knowledge, the
   range of methods, and the integration of ethics-in studies of the uses
   of the past in organizations.},

Title = {Estimating Contextual Motivating Factors in Virtual Interorganizational
   Communities of Practice: Peer Effects and Organizational Influences},
Journal = {INFORMATION SYSTEMS RESEARCH},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {29},
Number = {4},
Pages = {910-927},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Virtual interorganizational communities of practice (IOCoPs) enable
   professionals belonging to different organizations to exchange and share
   knowledge via computer-mediated interactions. Since knowledge sharing is
   socially embedded, contextual factors likely play an important role in
   encouraging individual's community participation. Specifically,
   professionals in IOCoPs are embedded in two different social
   environments: the virtual community where they interact with online
   peers and organizations where they utilize their knowledge. Therefore it
   is important to simultaneously study motivating factors generated from
   these two different contexts, including peer effects within and
   organizational influences outside the virtual community. In this
   research, we apply a novel econometric identification method to analyze
   a unique data set collected from a virtual IOCoP in the financial
   trading sector. We find that, after controlling for individual-level
   characteristics, contextual motivating factors from peers and
   organizations are influential both quantitatively and qualitatively in
   determining community participation. Differentiating multiple-level
   motivating factors across different contexts enables us to shed light on
   various mechanisms that IOCoPs can apply to engage collective learning
   and knowledge management across organizations.},

Journal = {ORGANIZATION STUDIES},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {39},
Number = {11},
Pages = {1625-1647},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {This paper revisits Meindl et al's (1985) `romance of leadership' thesis
   and extends these ideas in a number of inter-related ways. First, it
   argues that the thesis has sometimes been neglected and/or
   misinterpreted in subsequent studies. Second, the paper suggests that
   romanticism is a much broader and more historically rich term with wider
   implications for leadership studies than originally proposed. Arguing
   that romanticism stretches beyond leader attribution, we connect
   leadership theory to a more enduring and naturalistic tradition of
   romantic thought that has survived and evolved since the mid-18(th)
   century. Third, the paper demonstrates the contemporary relevance of the
   romanticism critique. It reveals how the study of leadership continues
   to be characterized by romanticizing tendencies in many of its most
   influential theories, illustrating this argument with reference to
   spiritual and authentic leadership theories, which only recognize
   positive engagement with leaders. Equally, the paper suggests that
   romanticism can shape conceptions not only of leaders, but also of
   followers, their agency and their (potential for) resistance. We
   conclude by discussing future possible research directions for the
   romanticism critique that extend well beyond its original focus on
   leader attribution to inform a broader critical approach to leadership
   studies.},

   the state's mandate through electoral violence. We study insurgent
   violence during elections using newly declassified microdata on the
   conflict in Afghanistan. Our data track insurgent activity by hour to
   within meters of attack locations. Our results suggest that insurgents
   carefully calibrate their production of violence during elections to
   avoid harming civilians. Leveraging a novel instrumental variables
   approach, we find that violence depresses voting. Collectively, the
   results suggest insurgents try to depress turnout while avoiding
   backlash from harming civilians. Counterfactual exercises provide
   potentially actionable insights for safeguarding at-risk elections and

Abstract = {This study examines how the historical state conditions long-run
   development, using Vietnam as a laboratory. Northern Vietnam (Dai Viet)
   was ruled by a strong, centralized state in which the village was the
   fundamental administrative unit. Southern Vietnam was a peripheral
   tributary of the Khmer (Cambodian) Empire, which followed a
   patron-client model with more informal, personalized power relations and
   no village intermediation. Using a regression discontinuity design, the
   study shows that areas exposed to Dai Viet administrative institutions
   for a longer period prior to French colonization have experienced better
   economic outcomes over the past 150 years. Rich historical data document
   that in Dai Viet villages, citizens have been better able to organize
   for public goods and redistribution through civil society and local
   government. We argue that institutionalized village governance crowded
   in local cooperation and that these norms persisted long after the
   original institutions disappeared.},

Title = {Design Incentives Under Collective Extended Producer Responsibility: A
   Network Perspective},

Abstract = {A key goal of Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) legislation is to
   provide incentives for producers to design their products for
   recyclability. EPR is typically implemented in a collective system,
   where a network of recycling resources are coordinated to fulfill the
   EPR obligations of a set of producers, and the resulting system cost is
   allocated among these producers. Collective EPR is prevalent because of
   its cost efficiency advantages. However, it is considered to provide
   inferior design incentives compared to an individual implementation
   (where producers fulfill their EPR obligations individually). In this
   paper, we revisit this assertion and investigate its fundamental
   underpinnings in a network setting. To this end, we develop a new biform
   game framework that captures producers' independent design choices
   (noncooperative stage) and recognizes the need to maintain the voluntary
   participation of producers for the collective system to be stable
   (cooperative stage). This biform game subsumes the network-based
   operations of a collective system and captures the interdependence
   between producers' product design and participation decisions. We then
   characterize the manner in which design improvement may compromise
   stability and vice versa. We establish that a stable collective EPR
   implementation can match and even surpass an individual implementation
   with respect to product design outcomes. In particular, we show that
   when the processing technology efficiency and product recyclability are
   substitutes (complements), a recycling network where processor capacity
   pooling leads to sufficiently low (high) cost reduction will lead to
   superior designs in the collective system and maintain its stability,
   and we propose cost allocation mechanisms to achieve this dual purpose.},

Abstract = {Happiness, defined as a state of well-being and contentment, is a
   central human goal. Despite advances in customer behavior research
   related to value co-creation, the link between customer happiness and
   these behaviors remains unclear. This study therefore examines
   customers' in-role participation behavior and extra-role citizenship
   behavior to determine their influence on customers' happiness. Customer
   participation and citizenship behaviors relate positively to customers'
   perceptions of both service performance and their contributions to
   others' welfare. In addition, collectivism moderates the relationship
   between perceived contributions to others' welfare and happiness;
   individualism instead moderates the relationship between perceived
   service performance and happiness. These findings provide both
   managerial implications and directions for business marketing ethics.},

Title = {Long Memory via Networking},
Journal = {ECONOMETRICA},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {86},

Pages = {2221-2248},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Many time series exhibit ``long memory{''}: Their autocorrelation
   function decays slowly with lag. This behavior has traditionally been
   modeled via unit roots or fractional Brownian motion and explained via
   aggregation of heterogeneous processes, nonlinearity, learning dynamics,
   regime switching, or structural breaks. This paper identifies a
   different and complementary mechanism for long-memory generation by
   showing that it can naturally arise when a large number of simple linear
   homogeneous economic subsystems with short memory are interconnected to
   form a network such that the outputs of the subsystems are fed into the
   inputs of others. This networking picture yields a type of aggregation
   that is not merely additive, resulting in a collective behavior that is
   richer than that of individual subsystems. Interestingly, the
   long-memory behavior is found to be almost entirely determined by the
   geometry of the network, while being relatively insensitive to the
   specific behavior of individual agents.},

Title = {Anatomy of use-inspired researchers: From Pasteur's Quadrant to
   Pasteur's Cube model},
Journal = {RESEARCH POLICY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {47},
Number = {9},
Pages = {1626-1638},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Pasteur's Quadrant model, published by Stokes in 1997, presents a
   two-dimensional abstract conceptual framework that proved immensely
   helpful to study and discuss institutional and policy arrangements in
   science. However, during the last 10 years the PQ model was also applied
   in a series of large-scale, survey-based studies worldwide to classify
   individual modern-day researchers according to their research
   orientation and performance.
   This paper argues that such applications are inadequate to capture key
   characteristics of individual researchers, especially those within the
   heterogeneous `Pasteur type' group who engage in `use-inspired' basic
   scientific research. Addressing this shortcoming, Pasteur's Cube (PC)
   model introduces a new heuristic tool. Departing from a
   three-dimensional conceptual framework of research-related activities,
   the model enables a range of typologies to describe and study the large
   variety of academics at today's research-intensive universities. The PC
   model's analytical robustness was tested empirically in two interrelated
   `proof of concept' studies: an exploratory survey among 150 European
   universities and a follow-up case study of Leiden University in the
   Netherlands. Both studies, collecting data for the years 2010-2015,
   applied a metrics-based taxonomy to classify individual academic
   researchers according to four performance categories: scientific
   publication output, research collaboration with the business sector,
   patents filings, and being engaging in entrepreneurial activities.
   The collective results of both studies provide more clarity on relevant
   subgroups of use-inspired researchers. The PC model can be used to guide
   empirical, metrics-based investigations of research activities and
   productivities, applies this approach to two case studies, and
   demonstrates the utility of the method while also reinforcing and
   enriching the growing body of literature showing that cross-sectoral and
   cross-functional research activities are more scientifically productive
   than research carried out in isolation of the context of use.
   Introducing the `Crossover Collaborator' subtype helps to explain why
   Pasteur type researchers tend to outperform other types of researchers
   in terms of publication output and citation impact.},

   transformative agency in different types of temporary service
   development groups in professional service organizations. Our study
   suggests how individuals' transformative agency emerges from their
   reflexivity and bargaining power conditioned by resource distributions,
   and how collective agency subsequently emerges from different
   combinations of these individual properties in temporary agentic groups.
   The study clarifies the interplay between the individual and collective
   levels of agency, and supports further multilevel studies on

Journal = {JOURNAL OF APPLIED PSYCHOLOGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {103},
Number = {11},
Pages = {1165-1180},

Abstract = {In traditional work contexts, factors such as individuals' general
   competencies are used to predict indices of their performance such as
   yearly performance appraisals. Whereas traditional approaches to
   predicting individuals' performance focus on differences between
   individuals, a considerable proportion of variability in performance is
   attributable to within-person sources. However, we submit that
   within-person variability in performance may also be attributable to the
   fact that people work in different contexts. Moreover, individual
   performance is often the result of unrecognized team contributions.
   Accordingly, we advance a Human Capital Resource Complementarity (HCRC)
   theory to explain the alignment of human capital resources with dynamic
   situational features, and to illustrate the influence of team collective
   competencies on the performance of individual members. We then
   empirically test HCRC theory-derived hypotheses using a sample of 169
   cyclists from 22 teams across 18 stages of the centennial Tour de
   France. Our results suggest that individuals' specific competencies
   interact with situational characteristics to predict their performance
   variability over time, beyond that accounted for by their general
   competencies. Moreover, these effects are accentuated to the extent that
   teammates' competencies aligned with individual competencies in a given
   situation. Implications for future theory building, research, and
   practice are discussed.},

   reactions to feedback},
Journal = {ACCOUNTING ORGANIZATIONS AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {70},
Pages = {52-68},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The audit review process is a key quality control mechanism. Recent
   evidence from practice suggests that regulatory risk has made reviews
   more critical, and audit supervisors are struggling with how to
   effectively deliver the ``tough message{''}. We contribute to the audit
   review literature by providing an in-depth understanding of the
   subordinate's perspective, focusing on the understudied topic of
   negative feedback and factors that might moderate its effects. We
   investigate these issues using an experiential questionnaire soliciting
   subordinate auditors' reactions to highly salient actual review
   experiences. We find both adverse and beneficial reactions to more
   negative feedback, including worse attitudes toward coaching
   relationships, more attempts to manage supervisors' impressions, but
   greater performance improvement efforts. These reactions are moderated
   by the subordinate auditor's feedback orientation (i.e., receptivity),
   and sometimes by the supervisor's goal framing (i.e., emphasis on
   learning versus performance). Collectively, participants more often
   chose engagement over workpaper reviews to represent their most salient
   experiences, and some results differ between these review contexts.
   Qualitative analysis identifies both similarities and differences in key
   attributes of these review types. These results are important, as the
   audit review literature predominately considers workpaper review, and no

Abstract = {This study examines whether community social capital in US counties, as
   captured by strength of civic norms and density of social networks in
   the counties, affects corporate social responsibility (CSR) of resident
   corporations headquartered in the counties. Analyses of longitudinal
   data from 3688 unique US firms between 1997 and 2009 provide strong
   empirical support for the propositions that community social capital
   facilitates positive CSR activities that benefit non-shareholder
   stakeholders and constrains negative CSR activities that are detrimental
   to non-shareholder stakeholders. Additionally, we explore the effects of
   institutional logics arising from community isomorphism on positive and
   negative CSR activities, respectively. And, we explore the respective
   effects of corporate engagement in positive and negative CSR activities
   on corporate financial performance. Firms undertake more positive CSR
   activities when such activities are more prevalent among other local
   corporations headquartered in the same county. But, there is no
   systematic relationship between negative CSR activities and the
   community-level corporate engagement in negative CSR activities.
   Positive CSR activities enhance a firm's future financial performance,
   and the positive effect is more prominent among firms headquartered in
   counties with high community social capital. However, negative CSR
   activities only reduce a firm's future financial performance among firms
   headquartered in counties with high community social capital; negative
   CSR activities do not affect performance among firms headquartered in
   counties with lower levels of community social capital. Collectively,
   these results highlight the distinct effects of local social
   institutions, namely community social capital, on positive CSR
   activities and negative CSR activities, respectively.},

Title = {Strategic concepts as micro-level tools in strategic sensemaking},

Abstract = {Research Summary: The purpose of this article is to illuminate the role
   of concepts in strategic sensemaking. Based on a longitudinal real-time
   study of a city organization, we demonstrate how the concept of
   ``self-responsibility{''} played a crucial role in strategic
   sensemaking. We develop a theoretical model that elucidates how
   strategic concepts are used in meaning-making, and how such concepts may
   be mobilized for the legitimation of strategic change. Our main
   contribution is to offer strategic concepts as a missing micro-level
   component of the language-based view of strategic processes and
   practices. By so doing, our analysis also adds to studies on strategic
   ambiguity and advances research on vocabularies.
   Managerial Summary: Our analysis helps to understand the role of
   strategic concepts, that is, specific words or phrases with established
   and at least partly shared meanings, in an organization's strategy
   process. We show how adopting the concept ``self-responsibility{''}
   helped managers in a city organization to make sense of environmental
   challenges and to promote change. Our analysis highlights how such
   concepts involve ambiguity that can help managers to establish common
   ground, but can also hinder implementation of specific decisions and
   actions if it grows over time. We suggest that under environmental
   changes, development of new strategic concepts may be crucial in helping
   managers to collectively deal with environmental changes and to
   articulate a new strategic direction for the organization.},

Abstract = {This paper provides a unique perspective on knowledge ecosystems by
   studying their organization. Grounded in empirical evidence, we propose
   that knowledge ecosystems consist of users and producers of knowledge
   that are organized around a joint knowledge search. A distinction is
   drawn between knowledge ecosystems searching for a knowledge domain and
   those searching within an identified knowledge domain, respectively
   characterized as prefigurative and partial forms of organizing. In a
   knowledge ecosystem organized in prefigurative form (to identify a
   knowledge domain), actors whose participation is affiliated,
   self-resourced, and unobliged probe that domain to identify and
   establish shared knowledge as a basis for collective actorhood, with no
   formal rules or coordination mechanisms. In a knowledge ecosystem
   organized in partial form (where a knowledge domain has already been
   identified), actors search and reveal problem- and solution-related
   knowledge, participating though formal membership and access to
   resources, and their contributions are monitored. The present study
   contributes to the literature by 1) specifying the distinct types of
   joint search performed by knowledge ecosystems; 2) considering how the
   nature of joint search affects how knowledge ecosystems are organized;
   and 3) distinguishing two forms of organizing knowledge ecosystems, with
   a focus on participation and coordination.},

Abstract = {While much research work has been devoted to supply chain management and
   demand forecast, research on designing big data analytics methodologies
   to enhance sales forecasting is seldom reported in existing literature.
   The big data of consumer-contributed product comments on online social
   media provide management with unprecedented opportunities to leverage
   collective consumer intelligence for enhancing supply chain management
   in general and sales forecasting in particular. The main contributions
   of our work presented in this study are as follows: (1) the design of a
   novel big data analytics methodology that is underpinned by a parallel
   aspect-oriented sentiment analysis algorithm for mining consumer
   intelligence from a huge number of online product comments; (2) the
   design and the large-scale empirical test of a sentiment enhanced sales
   forecasting method that is empowered by a parallel co-evolutionary
   extreme learning machine. Based on real-world big datasets, our
   experimental results confirm that consumer sentiments mined from big
   data can improve the accuracy of sales forecasting across predictive
   models and datasets. The managerial implication of our work is that
   firms can apply the proposed big data analytics methodology to enhance
   sales forecasting performance. Thereby, the problem of
   under/over-stocking is alleviated and customer satisfaction is improved.},

Abstract = {The influence of human resource management on innovation has attracted
   considerable research attention over the last decade. However, existing
   studies have primarily focused on the macro-level human resource
   management architecture, limiting our understanding about the
   cross-level origin of innovation. Developing an emergence-based human
   resource management framework, we propose that an employee-experienced
   high-involvement work system (HIWS) promotes innovation by eliciting
   collective interactions for knowledge exchange and aggregation. Further,
   we investigate the emergence-enabling process that facilitates an
   employee-experienced HIWS to give rise to organization-level innovation.
   Specifically, we probe three distinct emergence enablers that amplify
   the positive influence of HIWS on innovation by shaping the
   concertedness, direction, and adaptability of collective interactions:
   (1) the homogeneity of HIWS experiences as the internal mechanism, (2)
   the strategic importance of innovation as the external mechanism, and
   (3) the churn in human resources as the temporal mechanism. We tested
   our theoretical model using data from a nationally representative sample
   of workplaces in Canada (n = 2,639). Our results suggest that an
   employee-experienced HIWS was positively related to innovation. In
   addition, this positive effect was amplified by all three emergence
   enablers (i.e., the homogeneity of HIWS experiences, the strategic
   importance of innovation, and the churn in human resources).},

Abstract = {Managing constellations of employee relationships is a core competency
   in knowledge-based organizations. It is timely, then, that human
   resource management scholars and practitioners are adopting an
   increasingly relational view of human resources. Whereas this burgeoning
   stream of research predominantly positions relationships as pathways for
   the transmission of resources, we shift attention by spotlighting that
   the interplay between human resource practices and informal
   relationships perforates deeper than resource flows; it also influences
   how individuals view and define themselves in the context of their
   dyadic and collective relationships. Moreover, because human resource
   practices routinely involve human capital movement into, within, and out
   of the organization, these practices have implications for the network
   architecture of organizations. We integrate the social network
   perspective with the theory of relational identity to present a
   relational theory of human resource management that informs how
   modifications to internal social structures stimulated by human resource
   practices can influence individual outcomes by transforming individuals'
   self-concepts as relationships are gained, altered, and lost.},

Abstract = {This paper examines how alternative economic organizations can fight
   inequality without help from traditional partners such as social
   movement organizations. We focus on co-operatives' successful battle
   against corporate dominance in the Quebec funeral industry. We analyse
   their actions through the lens of Nancy Fraser's tridimensional theory
   of justice, which utilizes the cultural dimension of recognition,
   political dimension of representation, and economic dimension of
   distribution. We demonstrate how funeral co-ops empowered their
   federation to influence institutional inequality while maintaining a
   co-op identity by embodying the potentially contradictory flexibility of
   social movements along with co-op principles. This paper contributes to
   scholarship on collective social action by exploring the dual role of
   model and movement played by secondary co-ops such as the federation of
   Quebec funeral co-ops, which draws on local institutional and
   organizational resources to disrupt unfair structures. We also extend
   Fraser's theory, using it as a framework for understanding the dynamic
   relationships between inequality and its potential remedies at different

Title = {Can Shareholders Be at Rest after Adopting Clawback Provisions? Evidence
   from Stock Price Crash Risk},
Journal = {CONTEMPORARY ACCOUNTING RESEARCH},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {35},
Number = {3},
Pages = {1578-1615},
Month = {FAL},
Abstract = {Using a propensity score matched sample and a difference-in-differences
   research design, we find that stock price crash risk increases after a
   firm voluntarily incorporates clawback provisions in executive officers'
   compensation contracts. This heightened crash risk is concentrated in
   adopters that increase upward real activities-based earnings management
   and those that reduce the readability of 10-K reports. Based on
   cross-sectional analyses, we also find that the increased crash risk is
   more pronounced for adopters with high ex ante fraud risk, low-ability
   managers, high CEO equity incentives, and low dedicated institutional
   ownership. Collectively, our results suggest that the clawback adoption
   per se does not curb managerial opportunism but rather induces managers
   to use alternative channels for concealing bad news, which may
   contribute to a greater stock price crash risk; and the increase in
   crash risk is more likely in cases where incentives are strong or
   monitoring is weak. Our results should be of interest to regulators and
   policymakers considering the effects of clawback adoption on the
   investing public.},

Abstract = {The majority of common stocks that have appeared in the Center for

   listed companies explain the net gain for the entire US stock market
   since 1926, as other stocks collectively matched Treasury bills. These
   results highlight the important role of positive skewness in the
   distribution of individual stock returns, attributable to skewness in
   monthly returns and to the effects of compounding. The results help to
   explain why poorly diversified active strategies most often underperform

Abstract = {The aim of this Special Issue is to demonstrate how drawing on

   broaden the individual-opportunity nexus to make room for a variety of

   the different communities they serve. Leveraging construal level theory,
   we abductively derive an organizing framework that helps us articulate
   how stretching or compressing social distance can transform initial
   opportunities into occasions for serving the greater good. We identify
   two distinct mechanisms present in all five empirical studies that
   explain how the needs and hopes of many others may add creativity,
   consistency and connectivity to one's venture. We also connect these
   abductive insights with the two editorials that follow this introduction
   and nudge our collective attention towards the research opportunities
   awaiting our academic community once we begin to relax the egocentric
   reference point that, until recently, has defined the discipline of

Number = {3},

Abstract = {We investigate whether attitudes toward gambling help explain the
   occurrence of intentional misreporting. Similar to gambling, some
   financial reporting choices involve taking deliberate, speculative
   risks. We predict that in places where gambling is more socially
   acceptable, managers will be more likely to take financial reporting
   risks that increase the likelihood the financial statements will need to
   be restated. To test this prediction, we exploit geographic variation in
   local gambling attitudes and find that restatements due to intentional
   misreporting are more common in areas where gambling is more socially
   acceptable. This association is even stronger insituations where
   management is under greater pressure to misreport, including when the
   firm is close to meeting a performance benchmark, experiencing poor
   financial performance, or under investment-related pressure.
   Furthermore, these results are robust to numerous tests to address
   omitted variables and endogeneity. Collectively, these findings suggest
   gambling attitudes help explain the incidence of intentional
   misreporting.},

Journal = {MIS QUARTERLY},

Volume = {42},
Number = {3},
Pages = {697+},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Social media has changed the way many team members ``meet{''} for the
   first time. Due to the increased use of virtual environments, it is now
   common for team members to examine each other's profile on a firm's
   enterprise social networking site (ESNS) in lieu of an initial
   face-to-face meeting. This study examines how the information provided
   in an ESNS impacts impression formation at the initial formation of a
   virtual team, specifically perceptions of social capital (i.e.,
   relational, structural, and cognitive). To examine social capital
   perceptions, the elaboration likelihood model (ELM) is utilized to
   understand how not only information impacts these perceptions but the
   way in which the user processes information to form the perceptions.
   Toulmin's model of argumentation is used in conjunction with ELM to
   understand the strength of the argument presented. Results suggest that
   users evaluate ESNS information differently depending on the type of
   processing (heuristic or systematic) and that these social capital
   perceptions influence preferences for different team members.},

   crisis},
Journal = {HUMAN RELATIONS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {71},
Number = {9},
Pages = {1153-1178},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {This article explores the formation of work identities in times of
   financial crisis and extreme austerity. In particular, we build upon
   prior studies of liminality, a state of in-betweenness and ambiguity,
   and explore how individuals, whose employment opportunities and career
   paths have been disrupted, construct their work/professional identities.
   The study draws on 39 semi-structured interviews conducted in Greece,
   where high levels of unemployment and economic stagnation prevail.
   Persistent crisis and austerity have prompted extended periods of
   instability and unpredictability during which the unemployed narratively
   (re)construct their past, present and future work selves. We propose
   that frequent job changes and persistent lack of work are not linear
   experiences but, instead, require multiple and, at times, ambiguous,
   fluid and incomplete identifications. These identifications include
   attempts to re-affirm prior stable professional identities, to institute
   new, yet still unidentified, careers or to enact what we term `liminoid
   identity positions'. When in liminoid positions, instead of pursuing
   intangible work futures, the unemployed create anti-structural spaces in
   which they collectively practice alternative forms of work and
   organization. Concluding, the article provides grounds for the study of
   individuals' capacity to challenge the neoliberal restructuring of work
   and the possibilities for transformation in periods of unemployment and
   crisis.},

   distributed experimentation that lead to epiphany sense making. These
   two approaches triggered and enacted collective processes of shifts in

Journal = {JOURNAL OF APPLIED PSYCHOLOGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {103},
Number = {9},
Pages = {939-958},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Compensation research has focused traditionally on how pay design
   characteristics (e.g., pay level, individual or group incentives) relate
   to average employee outcomes and, in toto, on how these outcomes affect
   organizational performance. Recently, scholars have begun to pay more
   attention to how individuals vary in the strength of their reactions to
   pay. Empirical research in several disciplines examines how the
   interplay of pay systems and person-based characteristics (psychological
   individual differences, demographics, and relative performance or
   position in a group) relate to important work-related outcomes. We
   develop a compensation-activation theory that frames compensation design
   characteristics as workplace ``situations{''} providing cues that
   activate individuals' corresponding fundamental social motives made
   salient due to chronic or transient person-based characteristics. Where
   activation occurs, stronger-than-average responses to the compensation
   ``situation{''} are expected. Using the theory as a lens, we synthesize
   and reinterpret existing research on person-based reactions to pay
   characteristics, including sorting, incentive/motivational effects, and
   effects on collective pay system reactions and unit/organizational
   outcomes. We conclude with a research agenda aimed at refining
   compensation-activation theory and advancing the study of compensation
   as it affects individual and organizational outcomes.},

Title = {When Territoriality Meets Agency: An Examination of Employee Guarding as

Volume = {44},

Abstract = {Do managers behave territorially toward their employees? Despite
   accumulating evidence demonstrating the prevalence of territoriality
   over nonagentic organizational resources, key questions remain regarding
   the extent to which psychological ownership and territorial behavior
   occur within supervisor-subordinate relationships. To explore this
   question, we drew on territoriality and mate-guarding theory to
   ascertain how and why managers might utilize one form of territoriality,
   anticipatory defenses, toward their employees. In a four-study
   investigation, we find that managers consistently engage in two forms of
   anticipatory defense tactics, persuasion and nurturing, that are
   intended to defend ownership claims over their employees and limit
   employee defection. Our results demonstrate a positive relationship
   between psychological ownership of subordinates and employee guarding
   directed toward those subordinates. We also find that managers engage in
   employee guarding more when they anticipate an employee is likely to
   defect, and they adapt guarding tactics in response to the subordinate's
   general mental ability. Collectively, our results identify the
   motivations and conditions under which supervisors act territorially
   toward agentic subordinates, contributing to theory in territoriality
   and downward social influence.},

Volume = {42},

Abstract = {Organizations today can use both crowds and experts to produce
   knowledge. While prior work compares the accuracy of crowd-produced and
   expert-produced knowledge, we compare bias in these two models in the
   context of contested knowledge, which involves subjective, unverifiable,
   or controversial information. Using data from Encyclopedia Britannica,
   authored by experts, and Wikipedia, an encyclopedia produced by an
   online community, we compare the slant and bias of pairs of articles on
   identical topics of U.S. politics. Our slant measure is less (more) than
   zero when an article leans toward Democratic (Republican) viewpoints,
   while bias is the absolute value of the slant. We find that Wikipedia
   articles are more slanted toward Democratic views than are Britannica
   articles, as well as more biased. The difference in bias between a pair
   of articles decreases with more revisions. The bias on a per word basis
   hardly differs between the sources because Wikipedia articles tend to be
   longer than Britannica articles. These results highlight the pros and
   cons of each knowledge production model, help identify the scope of the
   empirical generalization of prior studies comparing the information
   quality of the two production models, and offer implications for
   organizations managing crowdbased knowledge production.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT},

Volume = {62},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {In this study, we investigate the impact of national culture on the
   effectiveness of bonus and penalty incentive contracts in supply chain
   exchanges. We conducted laboratory experiments in Canada, China, and
   South Korea, involving transactional exchanges in which suppliers were
   presented with either bonus or penalty contracts. Then we compared
   suppliers' contract acceptance, level of effort, and shirking across
   national cultures. Our findings reveal critical cultural influences on
   contract effectiveness. We show that although acceptance of bonus
   contracts is comparable across cultures, suppliers from Canada, a
   national culture considered low in power distance and high in humane
   orientation, exhibit lower acceptance rates of penalty contracts. In
   addition, we find evidence that suppliers associated with collectivist
   cultures exert more effort and shirk less in bonus contracts but these
   relationships also are more complex. When we compare contract
   effectiveness across bonus and penalty contracts within a given cultural
   setting, we find in all three countries greater acceptance of bonus
   contracts than penalty contracts. Also, after contracts are accepted,
   bonus contracts are more successful in China because suppliers exert
   greater effort and shirk less under bonus contracts than penalty
   contracts. However, in Canada and South Korea, the results of accepted
   contracts for both penalty and bonus contracts are nearly
   indistinguishable.},

Abstract = {Recognizing the need to better understand institutional change processes
   in authoritarian states, which play an increasingly prominent role in
   the world economy, we examine the efficacy of civic activism aimed at
   spurring governmental action concerning the environmental performance of
   firms in China. We highlight the paradox of ``responsive
   authoritarianism{''} on display in China: to avoid needing to rule by
   coercion alone, the government seeks citizens' feedback and tolerates
   pressures for change, but at the same time it resists the associated
   legitimacy threats regarding its capacity to rule. Local governments and
   the media play crucial and dual roles in this system: they mitigate
   change pressures from civic activism that takes place within the state's
   systems, but they magnify change pressures from publicly visible civic
   activism occurring outside those systems. We test our conceptual model
   using a unique data set of environmental penalties imposed on Chinese
   publicly listed firms from 2007 to 2011. Our findings contribute to
   understanding processes of institutional change and outcomes of social

Abstract = {How does national identity influence the way individuals respond to the
   demands of their work? Despite an increasing awareness of the complex
   interplay between intersecting social identities and work demands, our
   understanding of how they are influenced by national identity is
   underdeveloped. This article presents the accounts of employees from two
   Sri Lankan knowledge work industries, who were attempting to align work
   demands associated with ideal worker expectations, with the social
   demands associated with their national identity. Conceptualizing the
   empirical setting of Sri Lanka as a collectivist national context, we
   offer two theoretical contributions. First, by showing how a shared
   national identity significantly influences divergence from, and
   conformity to, ideal worker expectations in Sri Lankan organizations, we
   generalize understandings of individuals' negotiation of ideal worker
   expectations. In doing so, we build on and extend the prevailing
   individualistic' assumptions in collectivistic settings. Second, we show
   how ideal worker expectations enabled individuals to fulfill and refine
   demands associated with their non-western national identity, contesting
   assumptions that non-western national identities are challenging or
   constraining in global organizations. These findings lead us to propose
   a reciprocal influence between ideal worker expectations in global
   organizations, and expectations associated with national identities.},

Abstract = {At some point, fining managers in all organizations face the decision of
   whether to fill open positions with internal candidates (e.g., through
   promotions) or to hire external candidates (e.g., from competitors or
   new entrants into the labor market). Despite this ubiquitous choice,
   surprisingly little research has compared the effectiveness of internal
   and external selection or has identified situations in which 1 approach
   may be better than the other. The authors use theory on human capital
   resources to predict differences between internal and external hires on
   manager- and unit-level outcomes Analysis of data from a quick-servicc
   retail organization (N = 3,697) suggested that internally fined managers
   demonstrated higher levels of individual job performance and commanded
   lower starting salaries than externally hired managers. At the
   unit-level, operations led by internal hires demonstrated higher
   performance on organization-specific criteria (i.e., service
   performance), whereas no internal-external differences were found on
   more general criteria (i.e., financial performance). They also found
   some evidence that differences in unit service performance decreased
   over time (but did not diminish completely) as external fines improved
   at a slightly faster late than internal hires. Overall, these findings
   underscore the complexity of the recurring ``build or buy{''} decision.
   The results also suggest that internal hires generally outperform
   external hires, both individually and collectively, and they do so for
   less money.},

Title = {Do Parents and Peers Influence Adolescents' Monetary Intelligence and
   Consumer Ethics? French and Chinese Adolescents and Behavioral Economics},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ETHICS},
Year = {2018},

Abstract = {Adolescents have increasing discretionary income, expenditures, and
   purchasing power. Inventory shrinkage costs \$123.4 billion globally to
   retail outlets. Adolescents are disproportionately responsible for theft
   and shoplifting. Both parents and peers significantly influence
   adolescents' monetary values, materialism, and dishonesty as consumers.
   In this study, we develop a theoretical model involving teenagers'
   social (parental and peer) attachment and their consumer ethics, treat
   adolescents' money attitude in the context of youth materialism as a
   mediator, and simultaneously examine the direct (Social Attachment ->
   Consumer Ethics) and indirect paths (Social Attachment -> Money and
   Materialism -> Consumer Ethics). Results of 1018 adolescents (France =
   534 and China = 484; average age = 15.21) illustrate that social
   attachment discourages unethical beliefs directly, but encourages it
   indirectly through monetary values. Our multi-group analyses demonstrate
   a novel paradox: The correlation between parental and peer attachments
   is smaller in France than in China, but similar across gender. Parents
   contribute more than peers to social attachment in France, but both
   carry equal weight in China. There is a negative direct path for the
   Chinese sample and for girls. Indirectly, parental attachment prevents
   French teenagers' unethical beliefs, whereas peer attachment promotes
   boys' unethical intention, supporting the notion-bad company corrupts
   good morals. Across both culture and gender, monetary attitude excites
   dishonesty consistently for all adolescents. A negative direct path
   exists for Chinese boys only (the Pygmalion Effect for male little
   emperors). Overall, social attachment reduces unethical beliefs.
   Parental and peer supports shape teenagers' monetary intelligence and
   ethical or unethical decision making, differently, across culture and
   gender. We provide theoretical, empirical, and practical implications to
   ethical parenting, peer attachment, monetary values, and business
   ethics.},

Abstract = {Research on innovation networks has highlighted the pivotal role that
   actors with more prominence and power, such as hub firms, may play in
   orchestrating the activities of other network members along a collective
   innovation effort. Our study examined the under-theorized, but no less
   important, type of orchestration that characterizes other organizations,
   such as business incubators and venture associations, who seek to
   support the dispersed entrepreneurial efforts of network members. We
   refer to this type as ``open-system{''} orchestration, as opposed to the
   commonly studied ``closed-system{''} type performed by hub firms. Our
   findings reveal how the processes of open-system orchestration differ
   markedly from those of closed-system orchestration, and detail how these
   processes influence the micro-foundations of network members' sensing
   capabilities. By doing so, we also offer empirical substantiation and
   theoretical elaboration to the idea that dynamic capabilities might not
   reside exclusively inside firms, but could be co-created relationally
   with other parties in the business ecosystem.},

Journal = {ORGANIZATION STUDIES},

Volume = {39},

Abstract = {Hybrid organizational forms combine values and practices from different
   institutional domains, rendering them difficult to fit neatly into the
   structures of extant organizational forms. Since the work required to
   institutionalize a new hybrid organizational form may be beyond the
   resources and capabilities of individual organizations acting alone, we
   shift the focus to inter-organizational collective action. Using
   empirical data from a study of a European network of renewable energy
   cooperatives, we find that, in order to institutionalize the new hybrid
   organizational form, the network can contribute to overcome the
   legitimacy challenges inherent in organizational hybridity. In
   particular, the network builds field-level receptivity to institutional
   pluralism, collectively codifies the hybrid organizational form, and
   consolidates legitimation towards plural field-level audiences. In order
   to perform these institutionalization roles, the network itself becomes
   increasingly formalized and mobilizes mediating functions involving
   different types of resources, legitimacy and target audiences. The
   research advances knowledge of hybrid organizational forms and their
   collective institutionalization through inter-organizational networks.},

Title = {Towards a theory of ecosystems},
Journal = {STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT JOURNAL},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Research Summary: The recent surge of interest in ``ecosystems{''} in
   strategy research and practice has mainly focused on what ecosystems are
   and how they operate. We complement this literature by considering when
   and why ecosystems emerge, and what makes them distinct from other
   governance forms. We argue that modularity enables ecosystem emergence
   as it allows a set of distinct yet interdependent organizations to
   coordinate without full hierarchical fiat. We show how ecosystems
   address multilateral dependences based on various types of
   complementarities-supermodular or unique, unidirectional or
   bidirectional-which determine the ecosystem's value-add. We argue that
   at the core of ecosystems lie nongeneric complementarities, and the
   creation of sets of roles that face similar rules. We conclude with
   implications for mainstream strategy and suggestions for future
   research.
   Managerial Summary: We consider what makes ecosystems different from
   other business constellations, including markets, alliances, or
   hierarchically managed supply chains. Ecosystems, we posit, are
   interacting organizations, enabled by modularity, not hierarchically
   managed, bound together by the nonredeployability of their collective
   investment elsewhere. Ecosystems add value as they allow managers to
   coordinate their multilateral dependence through sets of roles that face
   similar rules, thus obviating the need to enter into customized
   contractual agreements with each partner. We explain how different types
   of complementarities (unique or supermodular, generic or specific, uni-
   or bi-directional) shape ecosystems and offer a ``theory of
   ecosystems{''} that can explain what they are, when they emerge, and why
   alignment occurs. Finally, we outline the critical factors affecting
   ecosystem emergence, evolution, and success-or failure.},

Title = {On the effects of authority on peer motivation: Learning from Wikipedia},
Journal = {STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT JOURNAL},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {39},
Number = {8},
Pages = {2178-2203},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Research Summary: We investigate the conditions under which authority
   can be deployed without reducing subordinate motivation. We show that
   lateral authority, the legitimacy to resolve task-specific problems, is
   welcomed by members of an organization in the resolution of coordination
   conflicts, the more so (a) the fiercer the conflict to be resolved, (b)
   the higher the competence-based status of the authority, (c) the lower
   the tenure of, and (d) the more focused the organizational members are.
   Analyzing the discussion behavior of members of Wikipedia between 2002
   and 2014, we corroborate our allegations empirically by analyzing
   642,916 article-discussion pages. Our findings, obtained for a modern
   collective production community, provide learning opportunities for how
   traditional organizations may want to govern activities of their
   idiosyncratically motivated staff.
   Managerial Summary: When managers use their (legitimate) power to take
   decisions on behalf of their staff, they risk setting back employees and
   making them detach from the firm. This danger is particularly salient
   whenever highly motivated teams of staff autonomously work on corporate
   problems and are used to governing themselves. Examples range from
   skunkwork initiatives within traditional firms to entire team-based
   organizations, such as Valve or Zappos. When and how managers can add
   value by resolving conflicts within and across these teams once their
   self-organization fails is what we study in this article. Inspired by
   data from Wikipedia, we suggest that managers should not intervene
   prematurely, benefit from visible competence, and are respected most for
   their actions by specialized peers who recently joined the organization.},

Title = {The Paradox of Agency: Feeling Powerful Reduces Brokerage Opportunity
   Recognition yet Increases Willingness to Broker},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF APPLIED PSYCHOLOGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {103},
Number = {8},

Abstract = {Research suggests positions of brokerage in organizational networks
   provide many benefits, but studies tend to assume everyone is equally
   able to perceive and willing to act on brokerage opportunities. Here, we
   challenge these assumptions in a direct investigation of whether people
   can perceive brokerage opportunities and are willing to broker. We
   propose that the psychological experience of power diminishes
   individuals' ability to perceive opportunities to broker between people
   who are not directly connected in their networks, yet enhances their
   willingness to broker. In Study 1, we find that employees in a marketing
   and media agency who had a high sense of power were likely to see fewer
   brokerage, opportunities in their advice networks. In Study 2, we
   provide causal evidence for this claim in an experiment where the
   psychological experience of power is manipulated. Those who felt
   powerful, relative to those who felt little power, tended to see fewer
   brokerage opportunities than actually existed, yet were more willing to
   broker, irrespective of whether there was a brokerage opportunity
   present. Collectively, these findings present a paradox of agency:
   Individuals who experience power are likely to underperceive the very
   brokerage opportunities for which their sense of agency is suited.},

Abstract = {This article takes the 2008-2010 financial crisis as a case study to
   explore the tension between responsibility and accountability in complex
   crises. I analyze the patterns of attribution and assumption of
   responsibility of thirty-three bankers in Wall Street, interviewed from
   fall 2008 to summer 2010. First, I show that responsibility for complex
   failures cannot be easily attributed or assumed: responsibility becomes
   diluted within the collective. Actors can only assume collective
   responsibility, recognizing that they belong to an institution at fault.
   Second, I show that blaming is a social process that should be examined
   contextually, relationally, and dynamically. I build on sociological
   theories to depart from the normative focus of philosophers, and the
   cognitive focus of psychologists, who have dominated the study of
   responsibility so far.},

Abstract = {Improving content sharing on social media platforms helps firms enhance
   the efficacy of their marketing campaigns. The authors study the impact
   of network overlap-the overlap in network connections between two
   users-on content sharing in directed social media platforms. The authors
   propose a hazards model that flexibly captures the impact of three
   measures of network overlap (i.e., common followees, common followers,
   and common mutual followers) on content sharing. Using data on content
   sharing from two directed social media platforms (Twitter and Digg), the
   authors establish that a receiver is more likely to share content from a
   sender with whom they share more common followees, common followers, or
   common mutual followers even after accounting for other measures. In
   addition, common followers have a higher effect than common mutual
   followers on the sharing propensity of the receiver. Finally, the effect
   of common followers and common mutual followers is positive when the
   content is novel but decreases, and may even become negative, when many
   others have already shared it. Collectively, these results have a
   bearing for marketers to more effectively target users for spreading
   content on social media platforms.},

Volume = {103},

Abstract = {In this article we build on relational Sociometer Theory (Leary, 2005;
   Leary \& Baumeister, 2000) to posit the impact of the belongingness
   threat of experienced incivility in one's work team on employee feelings
   of ostracism and subsequent engagement in proactive performance.
   Integrating the social-relational ftamework of Self-Identity Orientation
   Theory (Brewer \& Gardner, 1996; Cooper \& Thatcher, 2010), we nuance
   our predictions by hypothesizing that chronic self-identification
   orientations influence both the effect that expenencing incivility in
   one's work team exerts on feeling ostracized, and the impact that
   feeling ostracized has on subsequent employee proactive performance.
   Using a sample of 212 employees and their 51 supervising managers
   employed in an Internet service and solution company in China, we found
   support for our hypothesized model. Implications for theory and practice
   are discussed.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF APPLIED PSYCHOLOGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {103},
Number = {8},
Pages = {813-827},

Abstract = {Voice, or the expression of work-related suggestions or opinions, can
   help teams access and utilize members' privately held knowledge and
   skills and improve collective outcomes. However, recent research has
   suggested that sometimes, rather than encourage positive outcomes for
   teams, voice from members can have detrimental consequences. Extending
   this research, we highlight why it is important to consider voice
   centralization within teams, or the extent to which voice is
   predominantly emanating from only a few members rather than equally
   spread across all members. We argue that, under certain circumstances,
   voice centralization is harmful to the utilization of members' expertise
   in the team and, thereby, to team performance. Specifically, we propose
   that voice centralization is likely to have negative effects when it
   occurs around members who are more socially dominant or are less
   reflective. We find support for our arguments in a sample of 78 teams
   (319 team members) working on graduate student projects in a business
   school over a semester. Overall, through our theory and results, we
   showcase why it is important for future studies to examine the
   distribution of voice among team members.},

Title = {Negative Beliefs About Accepting Coworker Help: Implications for
   Employee Attitudes, Job Performance, and Reputation},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF APPLIED PSYCHOLOGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {103},
Number = {8},
Pages = {842-866},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {For more than 30 years, researchers have investigated interpersonal
   helping in organizations, with much of this work focusing on
   understanding why employees help their colleagues. Although this is
   important, it is also critical that employees are willing to accept
   assistance that is offered by peers. Indeed, helping behavior should
   only enhance individual and organizational effectiveness if employees
   are actually willing to accept offers of assistance. Unfortunately,
   employees may sometimes have reservations about accepting help from
   their peers. In four studies, we examine the negative beliefs that
   employees have about accepting help from coworkers. In Study 1, we use
   inductive research to qualitatively understand why employees accept or
   decline coworker help. In Study 2, we develop a preliminary,
   second-order reflective measure of negative beliefs about accepting
   coworker help that is indicated by the five specific (first-order)
   reservations about accepting help identified in Study 1-diminished
   image, reciprocity obligation, self-reliance, coworker mistrust, and
   coworker incompetence. In Study 3, we refine our scale and demonstrate
   its convergent, discriminant, and criterion-related validity. Finally,
   in Study 4, we investigate the consequences of negative beliefs about
   accepting coworker help. We find that those who hold more negative
   beliefs are less likely to receive help from peers (and supervisors),
   report more negative job attitudes, and have lower levels of in-role
   performance, citizenship behavior, and creativity. Furthermore,
   employees with more negative beliefs about accepting help from coworkers
   are seen less favorably by their supervisors. Implications and future
   research directions are discussed.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {45},
Number = {2},
Pages = {251-274},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Consumer movements are resolute and persistent efforts by organized
   consumer collectives to reimagine elements of consumer culture. Such
   movements often use creative public performances to promote their causes
   and to make movement participation more ludic and fun. However,
   collective creativity within consumer movements has rarely been an
   explicit focus of research. Using ethnographic methods and assemblage
   theory, this study elaborates how collective creativity organizes a
   consumer movement and facilitates its quest for market change. Findings
   show how the Restaurant Day movement initially emerged as a resistant
   response to market tensions relating to constraining food culture
   regulation in a Nordic market context. Findings then illuminate the
   movement's appropriation of collective creativity as its chief mode of
   organization and participation. Collective creativity builds on
   iterative and co-constituting deterritorializing and territorializing
   processes of consumer production that fuel transformative and
   explorative creativity, respectively, within the market context. The
   study provides new insights to consumer movement mobilization,
   organization, member recruitment, and market legitimacy. The study also
   provides novel theoretical insights to the study of consumer creativity.},

Abstract = {The present study approaches opportunities in international
   entrepreneurship from a systemic perspective. Based on research on the
   collectiveness of opportunities in international entrepreneurship and
   the concepts of activity and object from activity theory, we develop a
   systemic conceptualization of opportunity-oriented international
   entrepreneurship. Through an empirical study in Finland and Israel, we
   depict six collective opportunity beliefs, considered from the
   viewpoints of society, international venture, and outcome expectations.
   Furthermore, we induce three modalities for international opportunity as
   the object of collective activity and model systemic opportunity shaping
   as the core activity of international entrepreneurship.},

Abstract = {Management researchers increasingly realize that some theories do not
   merely describe but also shape social reality-a phenomenon known as
   ``performativity.{''} However, when theories become performative or even
   self-fulfilling is still poorly understood. Taking this gap in current
   research as our starting point, we develop a process model to show that
   new theories will only become self-fulfilling if (1) they motivate
   experimentation, (2) experimentation produces anomalies, and (3) these
   anomalies lead to a practice shift. On that basis we identify six
   boundary conditions that determine whether theories will come to shape
   social reality. To illustrate our argument, we explore the conditions
   under which theories that postulate a positive link between corporate
   social performance and corporate financial performance may become
   self-fulfilling.},

Abstract = {As members of local host communities, volunteers play an important role
   in effective long-term refugee resettlement. This study investigated the
   nature of volunteer commitment by organizational volunteers who were
   assigned a front-line role in organizing material assistance and
   providing information about cultural practices for newly arrived
   refugees. Using interview data from volunteers, organizational
   representatives, and organizational recruitment and training documents,
   the study found that volunteers' commitment was structured by the
   presence and absence of volunteer coordinators, the organization's
   clients and volunteers' significant others. While insufficient ties to
   the organization or strong, competing ties from significant others led
   volunteers to detach themselves from the organization, overly strong
   affective ties with refugees displaced organizational ties, leading to
   volunteers' organizational exit. This study problematizes an
   individual-centric, psychological notion of commitment; instead, it
   situates commitment as a collective communicative process whereby
   relevant stakeholders negotiate the relationships that tie them
   together. It thus expands the range of voices present in decisions about
   commitment and provides new data on how organizational and relational
   others impact sustainable volunteer management.},

Abstract = {Rewarding collective outcomes has become an increasingly important
   strategic motivational tool for driving collective success, reflecting
   the insight that paying employees for individual contributions does not
   always optimize performance in collective endeavors. Research into
   different types of collective pay for performance (PFP), or pay that is
   contingent on collective outcomes, has been studied in diverse academic
   fields (e.g., economics, strategy, psychology), but the
   compartmentalization between these academic disciplines hinders
   conceptual coordination. To advance this research and its related
   insights, this article provides a review of the theory and evidence
   pertaining to the relationships between different collective PFP types
   and collective outcomes. We also provide a meta-analysis that shows that
   collective PFP has desirable outcomes (e.g., meta-analysis shows an
   overall rho = 0.11; p<.001), substantiating the value of studying
   collective PFP separately from individual PFP. The review also reveals a
   lack of empirical and theoretical development and highlights the need
   for a comprehensive theory of collective PFP. Our cross-disciplinary
   review of 106 empirical articles builds a foundation for advancing
   common pursuits, integrating knowledge, and creating theory. The
   consolidated perspectives point to promising directions for future
   research.},

Title = {The Influence of Native Versus Foreign Language on Chinese Subjects'
   Aggressive Financial Reporting Judgments},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ETHICS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {150},
Number = {3},
Pages = {863-878},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Researchers have suggested that ethical judgments about ``right{''} and
   ``wrong{''} are the result of deep and thoughtful principles and should
   therefore be consistent and not influenced by factors, such as language
   (Costa et al. in PLoS ONE 9(4):e94842, 2014b, p. 1). As long as an
   ethical scenario is understood, individuals' resolution should not
   depend on whether the ethical scenario is presented in their native
   language or in a foreign language. Given the forces of globalization and
   international convergence, an increasing number of accountants and
   accounting students are becoming proficient in more than one language,
   and they are required to interpret and apply complex ethical
   pronouncements issued by various global standard setters both in their
   native language and in English. There have been calls in the literature
   to examine whether subjects make systematically different ethical
   judgments in a foreign language than in their native language. We
   contribute to the literature by drawing on culture, linguistics, and
   psychology research to provide empirical evidence that Chinese subjects
   are more aggressive in interpreting the concept of control when
   providing their consolidation reporting recommendations in English than
   in Simplified Chinese. We applied a 2 x 2 within-subject and
   between-subject randomized experimental design using a sample of Chinese
   final year undergraduate accounting students at a leading Chinese
   university, where accounting courses are taught in both Simplified
   Chinese and English. Students in our study are proxy for entry-level
   accounting practitioners. Our findings have implications for the
   globalized business world and cross-cultural research by challenging the
   commonly held assumption that an individual's ethical judgment is
   consistent in different languages. We suggest that systematically
   different ethical judgments in native and foreign languages needs to be
   recognized.},

Abstract = {Innovative entrepreneurship is an essential but often missing outcome of

   Being an entrepreneur in such settings means being a mentor, market
   link, and community safety net, and the types of opportunities
   entrepreneurs pursue are largely seen as pre-destined and inherited

Year = {2018},
Volume = {147},

Abstract = {To minimize waste and inefficiencies, research has sought to understand
   under what circumstances decision makers tasked with allocating outcomes
   to self and others maximize joint outcomes making decisions that provide
   the greatest net gain across all vested stakeholders, irrespective of
   beneficiary. We explore construal level as a critical cognitive
   mechanism. We hypothesize that high-level construal a representational
   process that expands mental scope by broadening attention to global,
   gestalt wholes relative to low-level construal a representational
   process that contracts mental scope by narrowing attention to local,
   idiosyncratic elements should facilitate sensitivity to the welfare of
   the collective unit relative to specific individuals. Four experiments
   demonstrate that high-level relative to low-level construal promotes
   decisions that maximize joint outcomes, irrespective of beneficiary.
   These findings contribute to a growing literature examining factors that
   influence consideration of joint outcomes by highlighting construal
   level as a key cognitive antecedent, with theoretical and practical
   implications.},

Journal = {ORGANIZATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {29},
Number = {4},
Pages = {678-701},
Month = {JUL-AUG},
Abstract = {In response to recent calls for theory to predict and explain the
   phenomenon of ``meta-organizations,{''} we set out to identify the
   causes of their formation. Using a cross-case comparison of multiple
   case studies in sub-Saharan Africa, where nine focal firms varied in
   their response to the complexities of sustainability, we examined how
   and why some firms approached sustainability through a meta-organization
   while others did not. Our findings show that meta-organizations may be
   an effective means of managing the complexity of sustainability when
   participants exhibit an openness to innovative forms of
   collaboration-which, in turn, rests on complex systems framing and
   experiential embeddedness-and when they collectively undergo a
   four-stage process of meta-organization formation that transforms
   dormant resources into critical sources for achieving systemic goals.
   Our results also suggest that meta-organizations may be particularly
   well suited to addressing institutional and market voids, which
   typically constitute highly complex economic and social contexts. In
   addition to making contributions to the extant literature on
   interorganizational relationships and networks, this paper, to our
   knowledge, is the first to examine the appropriateness of the
   meta-organizational form in less developed economies, extending the
   potential generalizability of its application to multiple economic

Title = {Identity Bias in Negative Word of Mouth Following Irresponsible
   Corporate Behavior: A Research Model and Moderating Effects},

Abstract = {Current research has documented how cases of irresponsible corporate
   behavior generate negative reactions from consumers and other
   stakeholders. Existing research, however, has not examined empirically
   whether the characteristics of the victims of corporate malfeasance
   contribute to shaping individual reactions. This study examines, through
   four experimental surveys, the role played by the national identity of
   the people affected on consumers' intentions to spread negative word of
   mouth (WOM). It is shown that national identity influences individual
   reactions indirectly; mediated by perceived similarity and sympathy.
   Consumers perceive foreign victims as different from the self and this
   reduces the sympathy experienced towards them. Sympathy is an emotion
   that shapes consumer reactions and regulates WOM. The study identifies
   two moderating processes of this effect. Individuals who score high on
   collective narcissism are most likely to be strongly biased against
   foreign victims. In-group bias is also moderated by the perceived
   severity of the crisis. When a case is perceived as very serious,
   perceived similarity plays a less important role in generating sympathy
   because consumers focus on the perceived suffering of the victims.
   Hence, in-group bias is stronger in cases perceived as having minor
   consequences. The paper contributes to the literature on corporate
   social irresponsibility and offers implications for both scholars and
   managers.},

Title = {Culture, Relationship Norms, and Dual Entitlement},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {45},
Number = {1},
Pages = {1-20},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {According to the dual entitlement principle, consumers find it fair for
   firms to price asymmetrically to cost changes-that is, for firms to
   increase prices when costs increase but maintain prices when costs
   decrease. However, a meta-analysis reveals asymmetric pricing is less
   prevalent in collectivistic (vs. individualistic) countries (study 1).
   We propose a fairness-based explanation, demonstrating that
   interdependent consumers in collectivistic cultures perceive asymmetric
   pricing to be less fair than do independent consumers in individualistic
   cultures (studies 2, 4, and 5). We attribute this cultural variation to
   culture-specific relationship norms. Specifically, we argue that while
   the practice of asymmetric pricing is consistent with the exchange norms
   among independent consumers that emphasize self-interest pursuit, it is
   inconsistent with the communal norms among interdependent consumers
   mandating firm benevolence. Supporting this argument, we find that (a)
   directly manipulating communal (vs. exchange) norms yields similar
   differences in fairness perceptions that mimic those due to culture
   (study 3), (b) the cultural differences are mediated by the communal
   mandate for firm benevolence (study 4), and (c) the cultural differences
   are mitigated when a firm frames asymmetric pricing as benevolent (study
   5). We conclude by discussing the theoretical and managerial
   implications of these findings.},

Pages = {665-688},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {This article offers new insights into the organizational framing of
   social issues by drawing attention to the use of visual framing. These
   insights are based on a case study of the organization, Drinkaware, and
   its visual framing of the issue of alcohol-related harm in its campaign
   material. The study identifies three overall visual framing functions
   performed by Drinkaware's campaign material: normalizing alcohol
   consumption, defining and delimiting the scope of the issue and the
   responsible parties, and establishing the organization's identity as an
   expert. The article contributes to institutional theory, and to
   organizational theory more broadly by elaborating on the significant
   role of visuals in the framing of an issue, particularly by providing a
   systematic elaboration of the visual framing functions and components.
   The article also extends the literature on issues and issue fields, by
   showing how visuals contribute to defining and delimiting issues and
   establishing an expert identity in an issue field.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ETHICS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {150},
Number = {1},
Pages = {159-183},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Banking scandals, accounting fraud, product recalls, and environmental
   disasters, their associated reputational effects as well as company
   response strategies have been well reported in the literature. Reported
   crises and scandals typically involve one focal company for example BP
   and the 2010 Deepwater Horizon accident. As business practices change
   and company supply chains become more complex and interlinked, there is
   a greater risk of collective crises where multiple companies are
   associated with the same scandal. We argue that companies are likely to
   behave differently in a group setting compared to when faced with a
   crisis individually. Using an inductive approach, we examine the case of
   the Rana Plaza building collapse. We find that organizations with a
   history of similar crises adopt defensive strategies and communicate
   much later compared to organizations which adopt accommodative
   strategies. Contrary to the individual case, in a collective crisis
   accommodative strategies result in more negative reputational damage and
   a higher burden of responsibility. We propose that the relationship
   between crisis response strategy and organization reputation is
   moderated by the crisis setting. We extend the logic of crisis
   management and corporate reputation to incorporate the case of a
   collective crisis.},

Abstract = {We examine whether initial loan sales in the secondary loan market
   relate to borrowing firms' accounting conservatism. We find that
   borrowing firms exhibit a significant decline in accounting conservatism
   after the initial loan sales. We show that the decline in borrower
   conservatism is more pronounced for firms that borrow from lenders with
   lower monitoring incentives and for firms that have lower incentives to
   supply conservatism. The baseline results are robust to a battery of
   sensitivity tests. Collectively, we provide corroborative evidence that
   lead lenders' monitoring incentives enforce accounting conservatism in
   the private debt market, and that lead lenders play a more prominent
   role than secondary loan market participants in shaping corporate
   (conservative) reporting.
   Ventes de prets et prudence comptable des emprunteurs Les auteurs
   s'interrogent sur l'existence d'un lien entre les ventes de prets
   initiaux sur le marche secondaire des prets et la prudence comptable des
   societes emprunteuses. Ils constatent que la prudence comptable des
   societes emprunteuses decline sensiblement apres la vente de prets
   initiaux. Ils montrent que ce declin est plus marque dans le cas de
   societes qui empruntent aupres de preteurs dont la propension a la
   surveillance est plus faible et de societes qui sont moins enclines a
   privilegier la prudence dans la communication de l'information. Les
   resultats de base resistent a une batterie de tests de sensibilite. Dans
   l'ensemble, les donnees que recueillent les auteurs corroborent le fait
   que la propension a la surveillance des preteurs chefs de file engendre
   la prudence comptable sur le marche des prets prives et que les preteurs
   chefs de file jouent un role plus determinant que celui des intervenants

Abstract = {To examine whether and how social movements that target private firms
   are influenced by larger protest cycles, we theorize about osmotic
   mobilization-social movement spillover that crosses the boundary of the
   firm-and how it should vary with the ideological overlap of the relevant
   actors and the opportunity structure that potential activists face
   inside the firm. We test our hypotheses by examining the relationship
   between levels of protest in U.S. cities around issues like Civil
   Rights, the Vietnam War, and the women's movement and subsequent support
   for labor-union organizing in those cities. Combining nationally
   representative data on more than 20,000 protest events from 1960 to 1995
   with data on more than 150,000 union organizing drives held from 1965 to
   1999, we find that greater levels of protest activity are associated
   with greater union support, that spillover accrued disproportionately to
   unions with more progressive track records on issues like Civil Rights,
   and that these effects were disproportionately large in the wake of
   mobilization around employment-related causes and shrank in the wake of
   conservative political reaction that limited room for maneuver among the
   external protesters, the labor movement, or both. Our research helps to
   specify the channels through which external pressures affect firm
   outcomes.},

Abstract = {Research on various distributed online information systems-including
   blogging, crowdsourcing, media sharing, online communities, online
   reviews, open source software development, social media, wikis,

   the level of user engagement and overall activity in most systems
   eventually decline substantially. Here, we draw on Hardin's theory of
   the tragedy of the commons and Ostrom's theory of polycentric governance
   to introduce a unifying theory of polycentric information commons that
   explains these phenomena. Further, our theory illuminates how
   polycentric governance principles, as manifested in system rules and
   infrastructure features, counterbalance various sustainability threats
   arising from unrestricted participation. By integrating previous
   research findings and offering new insights into information and
   governance practices, the theory, practically applied, can enhance the
   likelihood of sustained participation across diverse, decentralized
   online information systems. We conclude by discussing how researchers
   can use the theory in empirical investigations and how they can engage

Title = {The sources of dynamism in dynamic capabilities},

Abstract = {Research Summary: We develop a multi-level theory of dynamic
   capabilities (DCs) that explains resource dynamics by giving a central
   role to persons and interpersonal interactions rather than to abstract,
   firm-level entities. Our theory integrates the contrasting approaches to
   DCs in individual-, interpersonal-, and organization-level scholarship.
   Existing organization-level approaches portray DCs as collective
   endeavors but do not specify how they emerge and operate within
   organizations, while micro-foundational approaches illuminate actors'
   contributions but reduce a firm's DCs to the cognitions and actions of a
   few top managers. Our integrated theory instead explains DCs as
   effortful social accomplishments emerging from individual employees'
   capacity to leverage interpersonal relationships conducive to productive
   dialogue. The framework we propose offers new ground for understanding
   how DCs can be sources of sustainable competitive advantage.
   Managerial Summary: How can firms navigate the transformations that
   relentlessly raise new threats and opportunities in dynamic
   environments? We suggest that firms develop dynamic capabilities to
   navigate change when their employees are connected through high-quality
   relationships, empowering their innovative potential. Strategic
   adaptation is possible when people are given the opportunity to act,
   think, and feel creatively while performing tasks, thus envisioning
   opportunities to improve how the firm operates. This ability supports
   sustainable, firm-level innovation when employees are connected through
   interpersonal relationships founded on constructive dialogue. Dialogue
   allows participants to advance and accept proposals for change even in
   the presence of conflicting interests and viewpoints. Managers may
   therefore enhance their firm's capacity for change by fostering
   individual integration and developing contexts that facilitate dialogue
   and constructive opposition.},

   this market reaction, these firms are able to bargain for more favorable

Abstract = {Research on design and designers has emphasized the tacit nature of the
   aesthetic knowledge that these professionals draw upon to make decisions
   about formal properties of objects and spaces, but is less clear about
   how design teams address the difficulties associated with expressing and
   sharing this type of knowledge. A ten-month ethnography in a design
   consultancy revealed a range of multimodal and cross-modal ways in which
   members of a design team compensate their imperfect capacity of
   articulating verbally their aesthetic knowledge in order to enable
   creative collaboration. In so doing, our study offers two main
   contributions. It illuminates the interplay between designers' aesthetic
   experiences, visceral responses and intuitive cognitive processes that
   enable designers to draw upon their aesthetic knowledge to support the
   collective accomplishment of their task, and provides an interpretation
   of the design process as a form of creative' intuition driven by
   emotional reactions to environmental stimuli and emerging formal
   solutions.},

Title = {Multiparty Alliances and Systemic Change: The Role of Beneficiaries and

Journal = {JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ETHICS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {150},
Number = {2},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The intensification of cross-sector collaboration phenomena has occurred
   in multiple fields of action. Organizations in the private, public, and
   social sectors are working together to tackle society's most wicked
   problems. Some success has resulted in a generalized belief that
   cross-sector collaborations represent the new paradigm to manage complex
   problems. Yet, important knowledge gaps remain about how cross-sector
   alliances generate value for society, particularly to its beneficiaries.
   This paper answers the question: How cross-sector collaborations lead to
   systemic change? It uses a qualitative embedded case study design. I use
   two general cases of alliance-based interventions in the developing
   country Colombia. Embedded cases within each general case identify
   evidence of collective action capacity of the beneficiaries. Findings
   identify and explain alliances' contributions to beneficiaries' capacity
   building: brokering trust and creating spaces where beneficiaries
   develop an emergent collective action capacity. Alliances also enable
   beneficiaries to enact that capacity by building bridges, circulating
   capitals, and buffering relationships to protect people's initiatives.
   Alliances and empowered collectives of beneficiaries produce systemic
   change using five mechanisms: brokering trust, creating spaces, building
   bridges, circulating capitals, and buffering relationships.
   Beneficiaries increased capacity for collective action is an outcome
   that becomes an alliance input, leading overtime to further benefits
   involving systemic change.},

Title = {Capturing Collaborative Challenges: Designing Complexity-Sensitive
   Theories of Change for Cross-Sector Partnerships},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ETHICS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {150},
Number = {2},
Pages = {315-332},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Systems change requires complex interventions. Cross-sector partnerships
   (CSPs) face the daunting task of addressing complex societal problems by
   aligning different backgrounds, values, ideas and resources. A major
   challenge for CSPs is how to link the type of partnership to the
   intervention needed to drive change. Intervention strategies are thereby
   increasingly based on Theories of Change (ToCs). Applying ToCs is often
   a donor requirement, but it also reflects the ambition of a partnership
   to enhance its transformative potential. The current use of ToCs in
   partnering efforts varies greatly. There is a tendency for a linear and
   relatively simple use of ToCs that does limited justice to the
   complexity of the problems partnerships aim to address. Since
   partnership dynamics are already complex and challenging themselves,
   confusion and disagreement over the appropriate application of ToCs is
   likely to hamper rather than enhance the transformative potential of
   partnerships. We develop a complexity alignment framework and a
   diagnostic tool that enables partnerships to better appreciate the
   complexity of the context in which they operate, allowing them to adjust
   their learning strategy. This paper applies recent insights into how to
   deal with complexity from both the evaluation and theory of change
   fields to studies investigating the transformative capacity of
   partnerships. This can (1) serve as a check to define the challenges of
   partnering projects and (2) can help delineate the societal sources and
   layers of complexity that cross-sector partnerships deal with such as
   failure, insufficient responsibility taking and collective action
   problems at four phases of partnering.},

Abstract = {Despite the burgeoning number of studies that have examined
   leader-member exchange (LMX) differentiation, definitive conclusions
   regarding its effects remain scarce. We propose a theoretical framework
   for studying LMX differentiation through an equity-equality perspective
   derived from allocation preferences theory, allowing us to elucidate
   both the beneficial and detrimental influences LMX differentiation can
   have on workgroups. In a meta-analytic investigation including 4,114
   workgroups and 21,745 individuals, we found that LMX differentiation was
   detrimental to collective harmony and solidarity, as indicated by a
   consistent negative relationship with emergent states and group
   processes. A theoretical integration of our predictions within an
   input-mediator-outcome model of group effectiveness revealed a more
   complex pattern of relationships with group performance. By
   simultaneously considering the proximal and distal nature of group
   outcomes, we found that emergent states and group processes not only
   mediated the negative indirect relationship, but also suppressed the
   positive direct relationship between LMX differentiation and group
   performance. These findings demonstrate the utility of an
   equity-equality framework for understanding LMX differentiation in
   workgroups and imply that there are tradeoffs associated with
   differentiation that must be considered when predicting group
   effectiveness criteria.},

Abstract = {Research Summary: Much of the research on corporate collective action to
   manage common pool resources is focused on coordinated actions, such as
   voluntary programs, rather than collaborative actions, such as
   technology sharing. In this article, we examine inductively the
   collective actions taken by a consortium of 12 oil sands companies to
   address three environmental issues of different scale. We identified a
   set of organizing rules that determined whether the relationship among
   industry members would be collaborative or competitive, and found that
   the organizing rules for collaborative collective action were more
   effective for smaller scale issues (i.e., tailings ponds and water) than
   the larger scale issue (i.e., greenhouse gas emissions). Our findings
   contribute to research on the competitive dynamics of collaborating with
   competitors and on industry self-regulation.
   Managerial Summary: Many environmental issues, such as climate change,
   water quality, and contaminated land, are caused by the overexploitation
   of commonly shared natural resources. Firms will often overuse resources
   because their cost of use is less than the benefit that accrues. In
   Alberta's oil sands, 12 of the major oil sands operators, all
   competitors, have agreed to collaborate by sharing technology, which
   goes against the received wisdom of competition. This multiparty
   collaboration among competitors, while still relatively rare, is
   becoming increasingly commonplace. In this article, we outline the rules
   that allow this collaboration to flourish. Our most important finding is
   that the rules are shaped by the scale of the issue being managed, not
   the size of the collaboration.},

Abstract = {This study sheds light on polycentric forms of organizing and
   corresponding performance implications. Organizations with a polycentric
   architecture supplement their internal hierarchical decision-making
   structures with egalitarian, local structures in order to encourage
   collaboration with legally independent stakeholders. We ground our study
   on the planning stage for four capital-intensive infrastructure
   development projects (mega projects) in the UK. We first establish that
   megaproject planning is carried on by polycentric organizations. We show
   that in this form of organizing the promoter has decision-making
   authority over the high-order choices, but shares the authority over the
   local choices with groups of autonomous stakeholders. We also show how
   this organizational architecture addresses local disputes and pressures
   to relax performance targets. Our main contribution is a contingency
   model that proposes four conditions linking performance to polycentric
   organizing, whether or not i) the institutional environment empowers an
   `umpire' to referee disputes; and ii) the system leader can mobilize
   substantial slack resources to reconcile conflicting interests. We argue
   that the four conditions reveal very different classes of managerial
   problems, and draw implications for practice and policy including but
   not limited to megaprojects.},

Abstract = {To explain the legitimation of inequality among the members of a social
   system, we blend system justification theory and the theory of social
   judgment. We identify adaptation and replacement as two major mechanisms
   of inequality legitimation and examine their influence in the unique
   setting of a natural experiment, the reunification of socialist East
   Germany and capitalist West Germany. We show that the new members of a
   society in which inequality is broadly endorsed and perceived as
   enduring will adapt to this perception and come to view inequality as
   acceptable. This process of adaptation reflects the subtle but powerful
   influence of collective legitimacy on an individual's tacit approval of
   inequality. Inequality also becomes legitimate as older cohorts are
   replaced by younger cohorts; however, this effect is weaker than the
   effect of adaptation. We contribute to the literature by demonstrating
   that developing and testing a theory of how inequality becomes
   legitimized can provide new insights into the ideational antecedents of
   inequality.},

Pages = {917-927},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {In this study, we propose a stylized Cournot competition model under
   asymmetric market information and study the formation of producers'
   informational coalitions. We offer guidance towards how the information
   service operations can improve the producers' welfare. Our results shed
   interesting light on farmer producer organizations (FPOs) in their
   efforts to link farmers in developing economies by integrating market
   information. To be specific, by focusing on Nash equilibria wherein
   producers make coalition-joining decisions, we find that no
   information-sharing coalition will be formed when the public information
   provision is either too low or too high, or when the private information
   provision is high. When the private information provisions are
   endogenous, a coalition can be formed between two producers when the
   public information provision is high, while a fair allocation of payoff
   can be achieved by the dominant group architecture, but not efficiency
   in terms of aggregate payoff. The main theme is that the government or
   NGO should provide right amount of market information to the right
   target, and too much informational intervention leads to more
   inefficient production and unstable organization.},

   In the second study, using permanent work teams in various functional
   areas, we replicated the integrative mechanism and associated

Title = {The interdiscursive appeal of risk matrices: Collective symbols,

Journal = {ACCOUNTING ORGANIZATIONS AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {67},

Abstract = {In this paper, we investigate risk matrices as an increasingly popular
   technology of risk assessment and visualization. Drawing on
   governmentality studies and Jurgen Link's interdiscourse analysis, we
   analyze the interdiscursive character of risk matrices, the ways in
   which they appeal to a variety of users in different organizational
   contexts and disciplines and act as technologies that mediate between
   specialized and everyday discourses. We illustrate the interdiscursive
   appeal of risk matrices in terms of the ways in which they have been
   promoted as functional in different disciplines and application
   contexts, and we analyze the specific symbolism engaged by risk matrices
   in these different discursive contexts. Based on Link's interdiscourse
   theory, we argue that risk matrices `speak to' the user and work as
   application templates for processes of identification through semantic
   connotations and analogies that go far beyond concerns with precise
   measurement and mathematically correct manipulation of risk related
   data. Risk matrices become `understood' and are powerful precisely
   because they point beyond the specific events and processes represented
   on the matrix. As such, the widespread appeal of risk matrices is
   fundamentally constituted through their symbolic connotations by means
   of which complex and potentially not well understood processes come to
   appear simple, imaginable and `manageable'. More broadly, Link's
   interdiscourse theory contributes a semantic analysis to governmentality
   studies in accounting. It draws attention to the semantic connotations
   and analogies by means of which visual technologies of government
   mediate between broader programmatic ideas and the practices of local
   users. Furthermore, this analysis contributes to the debate on the
   visual nature of calculative inscriptions, illustrating how specific
   visual elements of risk matrix inscriptions relate to their
   (inter-)discursive promotion and proliferation, and it discusses how
   ideals of `judgment', in combination with ideals of algorithmic
   formulation, are at play in the promotion of calculative inscription
   devices. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Numbers such as output controls drive action in organizations, yet we
   know little about how key numbers are created and take on authority.
   Using qualitative data from multiple properties managed by a hotel
   management firm, we find that individuals develop and then become
   committed to achieving budget goals through a ritual of quantification.
   The budget numbers serve as output controls for the properties and
   employees. We find that the strength of the budget number as an
   undisputed future projection emerges from the ritualistic intertwining
   of process and normative controls in the course of producing a robust
   output control. Process controls delineate stages in the budgeting
   cycle, while normative controls (performative work and emotional
   investment) operate at each stage, propelling people from one stage to
   the next while also increasing commitment to both the process and the
   outcome. The result is a single reified budget number. This ritual of
   quantification further fosters collective solidarity and an underlying
   belief in the objective authority of numbers to motivate action, assess
   success, and drive continuous organizational growth. This work has
   implications for our understanding of systems of organizational control,
   rituals of quantification, and the microprocesses supporting the
   emergence of numbers seen as objective and neutral.},

Abstract = {Leaders often influence whether an employee stays or quits and yet
   research in collective turnover, or turnover at the work-unit level, has
   neglected leadership as a key antecedent. In the current study we
   examine how the quality of leader-member relationships within a group
   (i.e., leader-member exchange, LMX) influences building a shared mindset
   of collective organizational commitment and ultimately influences
   collective turnover. We build on a key tenet of LMX theory that leaders
   form differentiated relationships with followers and propose that not
   all LMX differentiation is the same and therefore, researchers must take
   into account the configuration, or mix of high and low LMX
   relationships, within a group. We expect LMX configurations will
   moderate the influence of LMX differentiation on collective turnover
   through the mechanism of collective organizational commitment. We find 5
   configurations of LMX relationships, including a bimodal, solo-status
   low LMX, solo-status high LMX, and 2 fragmented configurations. As
   hypothesized, LMX differentiation positively relates to collective
   organizational commitment and negatively relates to collective turnover
   in a solo-status low LMX configuration and a fragmented LMX
   configuration, and negatively relates to collective organizational
   commitment and positively relates to collective turnover in a bimodal
   configuration. Theoretical implications and future research directions
   are discussed.},

Title = {When marketing strategy meets culture: the role of culture in product

Abstract = {This research investigates how national culture interacts with marketing
   strategy to influence consumers' organic post-consumption satisfaction
   ratings of entertainment products rich in cultural content. Drawing upon
   a communication theory framework, we develop hypotheses concerning
   multiple interaction effects between culture and marketing strategies on
   consumers' product evaluations. We test these hypotheses by analyzing
   consumer reviews of 260 movies in 25 country markets. In support of our
   hypotheses, we find that the cultural congruence between the product and
   the market improves consumer reviews, and that the effect is stronger in
   cultures characterized by collectivism, femininity, and uncertainty
   avoidance, as well as for products more heavily loaded with cultural
   content. In addition, we find that the negative effect of delay in
   product launch timing weakens for cultures characterized by long-term
   orientation, and that the positive effect of advertising spending on
   consumer evaluations is stronger in cultures characterized by high power
   distance belief. These results provide practical insights into how
   managers should make decisions concerning product design, launch timing,
   and advertising strategies in international markets.},

Abstract = {This introduction to the Journal of Management Studies Special Issue on
   Inequality argues that the way we frame conversations about inequality
   reveals important information about how poverty and inequality have
   become institutionalized in modern society. We observe a distinct recent
   shift in the collective conversation about vulnerable populations in
   western society away from poverty and toward inequality. We question why
   this shift has occurred and who benefits from it. Drawing from the
   provocative papers that populate the Special Issue we describe how forms
   of talk can help create inequality, maintain it and holds the potential
   to change it. We encourage new research that adopts a holistic
   reintegration of poverty and inequality by attending to the dirty
   realism' of the violence of poverty and the dire consequences of
   internalized inequality.},

   Adoption of Public Bicycle-Sharing Scheme},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ETHICS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {149},
Number = {2},
Pages = {313-332},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {This study investigates the antecedents and mechanisms of consumers'
   adoption of a public bicycle-sharing scheme (PBSS) as a form of shared
   sustainable consumption. Drawing on marketing ethics and sustainability
   literature, it argues that cultural and consumption values drive or
   deter the adoption of PBSS through the mediating mechanism of ethical
   evaluation. This study tests its hypotheses using a sample of 755
   consumers from one of the largest PBSS programs in China. The results
   confirm the significance of collectivism, man-nature orientation,
   materialism, and face-consciousness as key determinants of the adoption
   of PBSS. Interestingly, these values play mixed roles in influencing
   PBSS adoption. It also finds that such values and beliefs need to be
   effectively translated into ethical evaluations of PBSS adoption, and
   need to be addressed in the specific social context. Thus, ethical
   evaluation constitutes a cognitive strategy that allows consumers to
   justify and defend their adoption of sustainability practices. The
   results suggest that a desirable sustainability program needs to not
   only cater to the cultural and psychological motivations of consumers,
   but also reflect the social norms and social context in which the
   sustainability practices and consumers are embedded.},

Abstract = {We present a dynamic model of sequential information acquisition by a
   heterogeneous committee. At each date, agents decide whether to vote to
   adopt one of two alternatives or continue to collect more information.
   The process stops when a qualified majority vote for an alternative.
   Three main insights emerge from our analysis and are consistent with an
   array of stylized facts regarding committee decision making. First,
   majority rule is more vulnerable than super-majority rules to the
   disproportionate influence of impatient committee members. Second, more
   diverse preferences, more patient members, or more unanimous decision
   voting rules lead to lengthier deliberation and more accurate decisions.
   Finally, balanced committees unanimously prefer to delegate deliberation
   power to a moderate chairman rather than be governed by a rule such as
   unanimity.},

Title = {The Demand for Bad Policy when Voters Underappreciate Equilibrium
   Effects},
Journal = {REVIEW OF ECONOMIC STUDIES},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {85},
Number = {2},
Pages = {964-998},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Most of the political economy literature blames inefficient policies on
   institutions or politicians' motives to supply bad policy, but voters
   may themselves be partially responsible by demanding bad policy. In this
   article, we posit that voters may systematically err when assessing
   potential changes in policy by underappreciating how new policies lead
   to new equilibrium behaviour. This biases voters towards policy changes
   that create direct benefits-welfare would rise if behaviour were held
   constant-even if those reforms ultimately reduce welfare because people
   adjust behaviour. Conversely, voters are biased against policies that
   impose direct costs even if they induce larger indirect benefits. Using
   a lab experiment, we find that a majority of subjects vote against
   policies that, while inflicting direct costs, would help them to
   overcome social dilemmas and thereby increase welfare. Subjects also
   support policies that, while producing direct benefits, create social
   dilemmas and ultimately hurt welfare. Both mistakes arise because
   subjects fail to fully anticipate the equilibrium effects of new
   policies. More precisely, we establish that subjects systematically
   underappreciate the extent to which policy changes will affect the
   behaviour of other people, and that these mistaken beliefs exert a
   causal effect on the demand for bad policy.},

Abstract = {While governance and regulation are a first step in addressing worsening
   working conditions in global supply chains, improving implementation is
   also key to reversing this trend. In this article, after examining the
   nature of the existing governance and implementation gaps in labour
   standards in global supply chains, we explore how Viet Labor, an
   emerging grass-roots organization, has developed practices to help close
   them. This involves playing brokering roles between different workers
   and between workers and existing governance mechanisms. We identify an
   initial typology of six such roles: educating, organizing, supporting,
   collective action, whistle-blowing and documenting. This marks a
   significant shift in the way action to improve labour standards along
   the supply chain is analysed. Our case explores how predominantly
   top-down approaches can be supplemented by bottom-up ones centred on
   workers' agency.},

   utilizing data from 74 health-care teams. We found support for the

Title = {An organisational perspective on the cluster paradox: Exploring how
   members of a cluster manage the tension between continuity and renewal},
Journal = {RESEARCH POLICY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {47},
Number = {3},
Pages = {674-685},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Clusters face what has been referred to as a `cluster paradox'; a
   situation in which a collective identity breeds cohesion and efficiency
   in inter-organisational collaboration, yet it hinders the variety needed
   to adapt to disruptive change and prevent lock-in situations.
   Accordingly, a recurring theme in the literature on cluster evolution
   and cluster life-cycles is the need for constant renewal to allow
   clusters to adapt to a changing environment. However, how individual
   firms enact a process of cluster renewal and consider possible response
   options is not well understood. Using a French energy cluster as
   empirical setting, this paper investigates individual members' enactment
   of the renewal in terms of how it could affect their current position,
   both structurally and relationally, and to what extent members felt that
   they had agency to steer the process to safeguard their position. The
   findings show that members' enactment of the proposed change does not
   only depend on the perceived impact of cluster renewal on the member
   itself but also on the impact the renewal might have on other members in
   the firm's network. The analysis also suggests that cluster renewal
   leads to a leadership vacuum where it is not clear who, if anyone, will
   lead the renewal process.},

   unethical actions that can occur even when the consumer is not

   propensity to act unethically towards a brand that they perceive to be
   harmful. We document that when consumers come to see brands as
   harmful-even in the absence of a direct, personal transgression-they can
   be motivated to seek retribution in the form of unethical intentions and
   behaviors. That is, consumers are more likely to lie, cheat, or steal to
   punish a harmful brand. Drawing on these findings, we advance
   implications for consumer psychologists and marketing practitioners and

   that aims to create a community of change-makers'. The findings suggest
   that such events can generate reflexive dis/embedding through two
   complementary mechanisms. Specifically, personal narratives of injustice
   and action and individual-collective empowering generate emotional
   dynamics that disembed actors from their given attachments and embed
   them within new social bonds. Through these mechanisms, the event in the
   case study was able to challenge audience members' conceptions of self
   and others and change their worldview. This research advances our
   understanding of how reflexivity can be developed by uncovering the
   emotional dynamics crucial to the dis/embedding of actors.},

Title = {When Public Recognition for Charitable Giving Backfires: The Role of

Journal = {JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {44},
Number = {6},
Pages = {1257-1273},

Abstract = {This research examines the effectiveness of public recognition in
   encouraging charitable giving, demonstrating that public recognition can
   sometimes decrease donations. While previous work has largely shown that
   making donations visible to others can motivate donors, the present
   research shows that the effectiveness of public recognition depends on
   whether potential donors are under an independent (i.e., separate from
   others) or interdependent (i.e., connected with others) self-construal.
   Across seven experimental studies, an independent self-construal
   decreases donation intentions and amounts when the donor will receive
   public recognition compared to when the donation will remain private.
   This effect is driven by the activation of an agentic motive, wherein
   independents are motivated to make decisions that are guided by their
   own goals and self-interests, rather than being influenced by the
   opinions and expectations of others. This research contributes to the
   understanding of the nuanced roles of both public recognition and
   self-construal in predicting donation behavior.},

Year = {2018},
Volume = {35},
Number = {1},
Pages = {394-433},
Month = {SPR},
Abstract = {Prior research emphasizes the centrality of audit offices in
   understanding auditing practices, and documents significant interoffice
   variation in audit outcomes based on industry expertise and office size.
   Our study examines how two city-specific labor characteristics also
   affect audit offices and local audit markets: the city's average
   educational attainment, and the number of accountants in a city, which
   proxy for a city's human capital. Our argument draws on the urban
   economics literature and predicts that the level of human capital in a
   city is positively associated with an audit office's ability to conduct
   high-quality audits. As expected, there is a positive association
   between audit quality (quality of audited earnings and accuracy of
   going-concern reports) and average education level in the city in which
   the lead engagement office is located. This association is generally
   significant for both Big 4 and non-Big 4 offices, but is relatively
   stronger for non-Big 4 firms that are more tied to local labor markets.
   A company is also more likely to choose a non-Big 4 auditor in cities
   with higher educational levels and relatively more accountants, and
   there is evidence of higher non-Big 4 audit fees as a city's education
   level increases. Collectively, these results suggest that local labor
   characteristics affect audit offices, audit quality, and the ability of
   non-Big 4 auditors to compete with Big 4 auditors in the audits of
   public companies.},

Abstract = {Most studies on the links between secrecy and creativity have focused on
   individual sources of creativity and the impact of organizational
   management on creative initiatives. However, because of their very focus
   on individual practices of concealment and personal creative capacities,
   they have paid scant attention to collective interactions occurring
   around secrets. In this paper, we illuminate some mechanisms through
   which the creative work achieved in secret by scientists is enhanced by
   the exceptional character of their situation within the company. Coping
   with these exceptional circumstances leads the group to increase
   commitment, cohesion and efficiency. We theorize creativity as a result
   of the multiplication of social interactions among individuals and the
   social consequences of working and cooperating in secret. We show that
   secrecy can help rather than be detrimental to organizations when it is
   analysed as a social fabric of interactions around work and common
   feelings triggered by the risks of working in secret.},

Abstract = {Many actors claim to be experts of specialized knowledge, but for this
   expertise to be perceived as legitimate, other actors in the field must
   recognize them as authorities. Using an automated topic-model analysis
   of historical texts associated with the U.S. amateur radio operator
   movement between 1899 and 1927, we propose a process model for
   lay-expertise legitimation as an alternative to professionalization.
   While the professionalization account depends on specialized work,
   credentialing, and restrictive jurisdictional control by powerful field
   actors, our model emphasizes four mechanisms leading to lay-expert
   recognition: building an advanced collective competence, operating in an
   unrestricted public space, providing transformational social
   contributions, and expanding an original collective role identity. Our
   analysis shows how field expertise can be achieved outside of
   professional spaces by non-professionalized actors who master activities
   as a labor of love. Our work also reveals that lay-expertise recognition
   depends on the interplay between collective identities and collective
   competence among non-professional actors, and it addresses the shifting
   power dynamics when professional and non-professional actors coexist and
   strive for expertise recognition.},

Journal = {STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT JOURNAL},

Volume = {39},
Number = {3, SI},
Pages = {664-696},

Abstract = {Research Summary: Constructing narratives of transformative change is an
   important but challenging practice through which strategy-makers attempt
   to influence acceptance of an ongoing transformation. To understand
   whether and how strategy-makers can construct a steady influx of
   captivating narratives of transformative change, we analyzed how one
   noted strategy-maker assisted the successful transformation of his
   organization over three decades by orchestrating the production of
   change narratives. Our analysis reveals that the strategy-maker
   constructed and reconstructed meanings of change over time using three
   sets of distinct but interconnected narrative practices. We develop a
   dynamic model linking the simultaneous mobilization of these practices
   to strategy-makers' ability to harness the persistent tension between
   novelty and familiarity in a transformative change, and thereby, win
   endorsement from key audiences.
   Managerial Summary: How can storytelling be used to influence acceptance
   of an ongoing organizational transformation? In this article, we try to
   answer this question by examining how, over three decades, Italian
   company Alessi documented its transformation from a manufacturer of
   kitchen steel utensils to a producer of a variety of household objects
   purchased also for their symbolic value. The leader behind Alessi's
   transformation, Alberto Alessi, orchestrated such storytelling effort,
   targeting employees, customers, retailers, and visitors to Alessi
   exhibitions. Our findings uncover how stories can be used to win
   audiences' endorsement of change through narrative practices aimed at:
   (a) constructing a collective memory of change, (b) depicting change as
   a novel but coherent departure from the past, and (c) portraying change
   as a transcendent endeavor.},

   Strategic Agility},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ETHICS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {148},
Number = {2},
Pages = {347-361},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Corporate sustainability introduces multiple tensions or paradoxes into
   organisations which defy traditional approaches such as trading-off
   contrasting options. We examine an alternative approach: to manage
   corporate sustainability with a paradoxical lens where contradictory
   elements are managed concurrently. Drawing on paradox theory, we focus
   on two specific pathways: to the organisation-wide acceptance of paradox
   and to paradoxical resolution. Introducing the concept of strategic
   agility, we argue that strategically agile organisations are better
   placed to navigate these paradox pathways. Strategic agility comprises
   three organisational meta-capabilities: strategic sensitivity,
   collective commitment, and resource fluidity. We propose that
   strategically agile organisations draw on strategic sensitivity and
   collective commitment to achieve organisation-wide acceptance of
   paradox, and collective commitment and resource fluidity to achieve
   paradoxical resolution. For each of these meta-capabilities, we identify
   three organisational practices and processes specifically related to
   corporate sustainability that organisations can leverage in pursuit of
   strategic agility. We offer a conceptual framework depicting the
   strategic agility meta-capabilities, and associated practices and
   processes, which organisations draw on to successfully manage corporate
   sustainability with a paradoxical lens.},

Title = {Auditor Face-Work at the Annual General Meeting},
Journal = {CONTEMPORARY ACCOUNTING RESEARCH},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {35},
Number = {1},
Pages = {365-393},
Month = {SPR},
Abstract = {This paper examines how auditors prepare for the annual general meeting
   (AGM) and how they report their work to the shareholders there. Prior
   literature has suggestedbut not explicitly studiedthat the endpoint of
   an audit is a state of comfort between the auditor and the management
   and audit committee members, but also is potentially fragile. The
   fragility can arise from a failure to relay trust to the investor
   community, which may initiate or increase doubts about the financial
   report and/or the auditor's independence. We build the case that an AGM
   is an event to study how the endpoint of an audit engagement is both a
   state of collective comfort and a fragile state. The analysis is based
   on ten interviews and three workshops with auditors as well as
   observations at 67 AGMs. To analyze the field material, the paper draws
   on Goffman's idea of face-work, which requires backstage preparations,
   notably with management, and a front stage performance as an independent
   auditor to relay trust to the shareholders. The paper details how
   auditors at the AGM perform as independent verifiers of the management's
   financial report. Although we recorded that auditors were typically
   successful in preventing the backstage activities from becoming visible
   to the shareholders, we found incidents that challenged both the
   auditors' and the managements' face. In analyzing these incidents, we
   found that auditors reinforced their image as independent to regain both
   their own face and the management's face. The management did not take a
   similar collective responsibility for the auditor's face, which implies
   that auditors were asymmetrically committed to the management. As a
   take-away, the paper discusses how governance mechanisms backstage are
   linked and can surface front stage at the AGM.},

Volume = {39},
Number = {2-3, SI},

Abstract = {This article uses the concept of style to rethink sustainable
   entrepreneurship. Our point of departure is the conceptual distinction
   between organization as style made durable and entrepreneurship as the
   disruption of style. We show that style is not simply an aesthetic
   category, but rather what ties different social practices together.
   While organization makes the connections between social practices
   durable, entrepreneurship disrupts such patterns. We further elucidate
   how organization and entrepreneurship are two intermingled processes -
   those of durability and disruption - that together enable the creation
   of new styles. In order to conceptualize this creative process, we
   explore how play can create disharmonies within the organization, but we
   also maintain that any new practice will remain marginal without a
   collective assemblage capable of adopting it. On this basis, we argue
   that sustainable entrepreneurship consists of making an environmentally
   friendly and socially conscious style durable, but also of disrupting
   such a style. In order to illustrate our argument, we use the example of
   the sustainable smartphone producer Fairphone. In conclusion, we argue
   that the concept of style may strengthen the dialogue between
   entrepreneurship studies and organization studies.},

   collectively determine the economy's equilibrium input-output structure,
   generating large differences in size and shaping both individual and

Abstract = {Drawing on a qualitative study of the banking crisis in Ireland, we

   through social comparisons that prompt imitation and through their
   enactment that prompts a reconfiguration of internal control structures
   and power relationships. The reinforcement of a shared frame dulls the
   emerging cues of changing market conditions and weakens perception of
   the risks of staying the course. A core contribution of this study is to
   highlight the cognitive and political processes by which a shared frame
   solidifies within an industry, trapping organizations in their enacted

   case studies, we examine how those who participate in
   inter-organizational sensemaking processes are selected and how the
   particular selection of participants affects the dynamics of the
   sensemaking process in turn. In our analysis, we show how the selection
   of specific problem issues influences who joins or withdraws from the
   collaboration and we identify a mechanism that accounts for changes in
   the particular dynamics of the sensemaking process over time. Our
   findings help explain how the process of inter-organizational
   sensemaking can yield different outcomes.
   Managerial Summary: The ability to make sense of the business
   environment is central to strategic management. As the complexity of the
   environment increases and interpreting it becomes more difficult,
   organizations increasingly turn to inter-organizational collaboration,
   which allows them to pool their expertise in order to explore strategic
   issues. We examine how the participants in projects of joint exploration
   are selected and how the selection of participants affects the process
   of exploration in turn. More specifically, we describe how the aspects
   on which collaborating organizations choose to focus influence who joins
   and who withdraws from a collaboration. We also identify a mechanism
   that accounts for differences and changes in the dynamics of the
   sensemaking process over time. These changes affect how the
   collaborators come to understand their organization's business
   environment.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this article is to explore a critical paradox related to
   the expression of moral courage in organizations, which is that although
   morally courageous acts are aimed at fostering collective growth,
   vitality, and virtue, their initial result is typically one of
   collective unease, preoccupation, or lapse, reflected in the social
   ostracism and censure of the courageous member and message. Therefore,
   this article addresses the questions of why many organizational groups
   suffer stagnation or decline rather than growth and vitality following
   acts of moral courage, and what can be done to ameliorate this outcome.
   A general system, relational psychodynamic perspective through which
   organizational group members might receive and respond to acts of moral
   courage is offered, and seven insights emerging from this perspective
   for fostering collective growth and vitality following acts of moral
   courage are provided.},

Year = {2018},
Volume = {61},
Number = {1},

Abstract = {The expectation that selection practices contribute to organizational
   performance has been long assumed; however, research on personnel
   selection has neglected to consider why firms differ in their use of
   selection practices and whether selection practices relate to
   organizational performance under different competitive environments.
   Based on strategic human resource management research, we introduce
   contingency theory to examine whether external (industry
   characteristics) and internal (prior firm performance and collective
   turnover) environments affect the use of selection practices, how the
   adoption of selection practices relates to subsequent firm performance,
   and whether the external (industry) and internal (selection stages and
   collective turnover) environments moderate the selection-performance
   relationship. Using a sample of 413 firms, we found that firms use more
   selection practices when there is less collective turnover and when
   firms are within low-growth and stable industries. The results also show
   that firms employing more selection practices generated greater
   productivity but not profit. Positive effects occur when firms have less
   collective turnover and are within dynamic industries but, surprisingly,
   the effects of selection on performance can actually be negative in
   stable industries. These findings provide new insights about the
   strategic value of personnel selection; one that is sensitive to and
   contingent upon competitive environments.},

Title = {Imagining ``non-nationality': Cosmopolitanism as a source of identity
   and belonging},
Journal = {HUMAN RELATIONS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {71},
Number = {2},
Pages = {129-154},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Current literature tends to see cosmopolitan identity formation as an
   individual endeavour of developing a stance of openness, and
   transcending discourses of national and other cultural identities. This
   article challenges the essentialism inherent in this model by proposing
   a different framing of cosmopolitan identity formation that shifts the
   focus to how people collectively mobilize cosmopolitanism as a resource
   for cultural identity construction. The article is based on an
   anthropological study of transnational professionals who are part of a
   diverse expatriate community in Amsterdam. The analysis shows how these
   professionals draw on cosmopolitanism to define themselves as
   non-nationals'. This involves downplaying national affiliations and
   cultural differences while also marking national identity categories and
   cultural features' to maintain the difference they collectively embrace.
   This, however, does not imply openness to all otherness. Boundary
   drawing to demarcate the cosmopolitan us' in relation to national
   (mono)culture is equally important. The article argues that cosmopolitan
   identities are socially accomplished as particular modes of collective
   belonging that are part of - not beyond - a global discursive sphere of
   identity politics.},

   INTERACTIVE EFFECTS OF SELF-CONSTRUALS AND WORK CHARACTERISTICS},
Journal = {ACADEMY OF MANAGEMENT JOURNAL},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {61},
Number = {1},

Month = {FEB 1},
Abstract = {When and why do people engage in different forms of proactive behavior
   at work? We propose that as a result of a process of trait activation,
   employees with different types of self-construal engage in distinct
   forms of proactive behavior if they work in environments consistent with
   their self-construals. In an experimental Study 1 (n = 61), we examined
   the effect of self-construals on proactivity and found that people
   primed with interdependent self-construals engaged in more work
   unit-oriented proactive behavior when job interdependence was also
   manipulated. Priming independent self-construals did not enhance
   career-oriented proactive behavior, even when we manipulated job
   autonomy. In a field Study 2 (n = 205), we found that employees with
   interdependent self-construals working in jobs with high interdependence
   reported higher work unit commitment and higher work unit-oriented
   proactive behavior compared to employees in low interdependent jobs.
   Employees with independent self-construals working in jobs with high
   autonomy also exhibited stronger career commitment and more
   career-oriented proactive behavior than did those in jobs with low
   autonomy. This research offers a theoretical framework to explain how
   dispositional and situational factors interactively shape people's
   engagement in different forms of proactive behavior.},

Abstract = {Metaphors are central in organization theory for they help the creation
   of knowledge by altering concepts or generating new ones. Yet, despite
   their importance, little is known about how metaphors are used in
   processes of knowledge creation across worldviews. In such contexts,
   participants maintain their specialization, work separately, and resort
   to interpretable devices like metaphors to create together. With a
   longitudinal study of a multidisciplinary scientific project aimed at
   repairing broken spinal cord tissues, we show how metaphors facilitate
   collective knowledge creation. We contribute to the theory of knowledge
   creation across worldviews by showing the consequences of the diverse
   creative outcomes of metaphors on the orientation and stability of the
   collective work. Moreover, we propose how to control and predict the
   creative outcomes of metaphors by modifying the knowledge bases that are
   engaged in the creative process. We contribute to the theory on cycles
   of knowledge creation by showing that a metaphor can extend knowledge
   both horizontally and vertically, and by specifying the relationships
   between the knowledge created and the elements that simultaneously
   populate the creative cycles.},

Abstract = {Context-emergent turnover theory (CETT) focuses on the contextual
   factors that influence the turnover-firm performance relationship, yet
   to date, has not investigated how particular firms weather the
   detrimental effects of loss more effectively than others. We build on
   the CETT literature by theorizing that different human resource bundling
   strategies are central contextual factors that impact the effects of
   human resource exit. Specifically, we argue that bundling human
   resources prior to exit in greater concentrations deflects some harmful
   effects of turnover. Pre-exit bundling ensures that remaining
   professionals post-exit retain both the capacity necessary to meet job
   demands and the critical tacit knowledge of firm routines that maintain
   effectiveness. Our study examines the loss of professionals in a panel
   of the largest U.S.-based law firms. We find general support for our
   theory. Results show that losing professionals when the pre-exit
   bundling had produced greater service-, hiring-, and
   geographic-concentration lessens the negative effects of loss.},

   opportunities for employees to self-organize around common goals or
   interests. However, little is known about the different user classes
   that exist in ESM and the factors that drive contributions to ESM
   communities. Using multilevel analyses of secondary data from the ESM of
   a global organization, we find that (1) although ESM communities reflect
   a core-periphery structure similar to that identified in other forms of
   online communities, nearly two-thirds of the users represent promoters-a
   distinct class of users who use the platform primarily to post
   promotional content without viewing existing content created by others;
   and (2) despite individual differences in user type, the actual
   contribution to an ESM community is the result of an intricate
   interaction between a user's disposition for participation and a set of
   group characteristics. Our findings suggest that recognizing the unique
   contribution patterns of different user groups is key to understanding
   participation in ESM communities.},

Abstract = {This article introduces `activist entrepreneuring' to suggest a fresh
   understanding of entrepreneuring which foregrounds how constraints of
   imagination are removed through critical speech. Specifically, we link
   Michel Foucault's work on parrhesia, or courageous speech, and various
   literatures on (utopian) imagination to discuss `disruptive
   truth-telling' as the generative mechanism of activist entrepreneuring
   whose transformative force resides in breaking free from existing
   limitations of collective imagination, or what we refer to as the
   `orthodox social imaginary'. We use the activist group Yes Men to
   develop a process model which throws into sharper relief how disruptive
   truth-telling is employed, on the one hand, to expose and problematize
   the boundaries of collective imagination, and, on the other, to create
   `possible worlds' that prefigure ways of doing business that are
   consistent with broader societal interest. The three interrelated
   objectives of this article are: first, to make creative use of the
   humanities to emphasize how disruptive truth-telling actualizes
   possibilities for imagining future realities that seem impossible from
   the standpoint of dominant imagination. Second, to make the case for
   seeing changes of collective imagination as a genuine entrepreneurial
   accomplishment. And third, to identify boundary conditions that help us
   strengthen the explanatory power of our theorizing on disruptive
   truth-telling.},

Abstract = {The emergence of financial technology around the globe is driven by
   efforts to deconstruct and reimagine business models embedded within
   financial services. Entrepreneurial endeavours to this end are diverse.
   Indeed, the propensity toward complexity is considerable, bridging a
   range of financial services, markets, innovations, industry
   participants, infrastructures, and technologies. This study aims to
   improve comprehension of the global fintech landscape. It is based on
   the analysis of start-ups that participated in SWIFT's Innotribe
   competition. We used cluster analysis to group 402 fintech start-up
   firms, and then selected representative cases to create a foundational
   understanding of the structure of the fintech landscape. The main
   findings of this work are: (1) the development of fintech clusters to
   classify core services, business infrastructures, and underlying
   component technologies, which characterize fintech; (2) an analysis of
   how fintechs synthesize different technologies to restructure flows of
   financial information through competitive and cooperative mechanisms of
   disinter-mediation, extension of access, financialization,
   hybridization, and personalization; (3) an analysis of related
   strategies for value creation connected with the competitive and
   cooperative mechanisms that were identified. Collectively, our results
   offer new insights into the diversity and range of emergent innovations
   and technologies that Q2 are transforming the financial services
   industry worldwide.},

Title = {Key Affordances of Platform-as-a-Service: Self-Organization and
   Continuous Feedback},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEMS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {35},
Number = {3},
Pages = {776-812},
Abstract = {Although software development teams increasingly use
   Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS), a minimal amount is known regarding the
   impact of PaaS on software development. We explored the impact of PaaS
   on software development through a grounded-theory study, conducting 48
   interviews in 16 teams. The data turned our attention to the
   affordances, or potentials for action, that PaaS provides to software
   development teams. Two key affordances emerging from our data analysis
   were self-organizing and triggering continuous feedback. Actualizing
   these affordances helped accelerate the collective learning processes
   that underlie software development, thus supporting software development
   teams in their quest for agility. Our emerging theory explains how, why,
   and when these affordances arise. The key contribution of our paper lies
   in unveiling how the use of cloud computing technology can transform
   technology-mediated collective learning activities by helping to remove
   barriers to rapid feedback. Our findings also imply that organizations
   can leverage PaaS to facilitate the transition to agile and continuous
   software development practices, in particular in conjunction with
   cross-functional team designs.},

Title = {Detecting Review Manipulation on Online Platforms with Hierarchical
   Supervised Learning},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEMS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {35},
Number = {1},
Pages = {350-380},
Abstract = {Opinion spammers exploit consumer trust by posting false or deceptive
   reviews that may have a negative impact on both consumers and
   businesses. These dishonest posts are difficult to detect because of
   complex interactions between several user characteristics, such as
   review velocity, volume, and variety. We propose a novel hierarchical
   supervised-learning approach to increase the likelihood of detecting
   anomalies by analyzing several user features and then characterizing
   their collective behavior in a unified manner. Specifically, we model
   user characteristics and interactions among them as univariate and
   multivariate distributions. We then stack these distributions using
   several supervised-learning techniques, such as logistic regression,
   support vector machine, and k-nearest neighbors yielding robust
   meta-classifiers. We perform a detailed evaluation of methods and then
   develop empirical insights. This approach is of interest to online
   business platforms because it can help reduce false reviews and increase
   consumer confidence in the credibility of their online information. Our
   study contributes to the literature by incorporating distributional
   aspects of features in machine-learning techniques, which can improve
   the performance of fake reviewer detection on digital platforms.},

Journal = {STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT JOURNAL},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {39},
Number = {1},
Pages = {242-266},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Research Summary: While extant research recognizes the importance of
   collective action for market formation, it provides little understanding
   about when and to what extent collective action is important. In this
   article, we develop a novel theoretical framework detailing what
   collective action problems and solutions arise in market formation and
   under what conditions. Our framework centers on the development of
   market infrastructure with three key factors that influence the nature
   and extent of collective action problems: perceived returns to
   contributions, excludability, and contribution substitutability. We
   apply our framework to diverse market formation contexts and derive a
   set of attendant propositions. Finally, we show how collective action
   problems and solutions evolve during market formation efforts and
   discuss how our framework contributes to strategic management,
   entrepreneurship, and organization literatures.
   Managerial Summary: This article lays out the key considerations that
   players operating in new markets should contemplate when making
   nontrivial investments in those spaces. As collective action problems
   can thwart efforts to establish new markets, we ask: When and under what
   conditions should market players collaborate rather than act
   independently? And if players collaborate, how should they coordinate to
   establish a new market? To address these research questions, we develop
   a novel generalizable framework of collective action in market
   formation. Our framework assesses the presence and type of collective
   action problems that hinder market formation and identifies potential
   solutions tied to those collective action problems.},

Abstract = {Most studies of worker participation examine either formal participatory
   structures or informal participation. Yet, increasingly, works councils
   and other formal participatory bodies are operating in parallel with
   collective bargaining or are filling the void left by its decline.
   Moreover, these bodies are sprouting in workplaces in which workers have
   long held a modicum of influence, authority, and production- or
   service-related information. This study leverages a case from the health
   care sector to examine the interaction between formal and informal
   worker participation. Seeking to determine whether or not these two
   forceseach independently shown to benefit production or service
   deliverycomplement or undermine one another, we find evidence for the
   latter. In the case of the 27 primary care departments that we study,
   formal structures appeared to help less-participatory departments
   improve their performance. However, these same structures also appeared
   to impede those departments with previously high levels of informal
   participation. While we remain cautious with respect to
   generalizability, the case serves as a warning to those seeking to
   institute participation in an environment in which some workers have
   long felt they had the requisite authority, influence, and information
   necessary to perform their jobs effectively.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEMS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {35},

Abstract = {Cyberdeviance, intentional use of information technology (IT) in the
   workplace that is contrary to the explicit and implicit norms of the
   organization and that threatens the well-being of the organization
   and/or its members, is an important research stream that has gained
   attention in academia and industry. Prior studies have treated different
   forms of cyberdeviance as different phenomena, resulting in a lack of a
   collective underlying conceptualization of cyberdeviance. This work
   inductively and empirically derives a typology of cyberdeviance with 439
   respondents across three phases. Our results suggest that cyberdeviance
   varies along 3 dimensions: cyberdeviant behaviors that are minor versus
   serious; cyberdeviant behaviors that target individuals versus
   organizations; and cyberdeviant behaviors that require low versus high
   technical skill. We thus provide a comprehensive framework that fosters
   a logical linkage of various research programs related to cyberdeviance
   to guide future research investigation. The typology will help managers
   to distinguish different cyberdeviant behaviors and implement suitable
   interventions depending on the behavior.},

Abstract = {Increasingly, continuous organizational change is viewed as the new
   reality for organizations and their members. However, this model of
   organizational change, which is usually characterized by ongoing,
   cumulative, and substantive change from the bottom up, remains
   underexplored in the literature. Taking a multilevel approach, the
   authors develop a theoretical model to explain the mechanisms behind the
   amplification and accumulation of valuable, ongoing work-unit level
   changes over time, which then become substantial changes at the
   organizational level. Drawing on the concept of emergence, they first
   focus on the cognitive search mechanisms of work-unit members and
   managers to illustrate how work-unit level routine changes may be
   amplified to the organization through 2 unique processes: composition
   and compilation emergence. The authors then discuss the managers' role
   in creating a sense of coherence and meaning for the accumulation of
   these emergent changes over time. They conclude this research by
   discussing the theoretical implications of their model for the existing
   literature of organizational change.},

Abstract = {Agency and institutions are essential concepts within institutional

   theory. We then analyse the relationship of actors and institutions
   through four lenses - the wilful actor, collective intentionality,
   patchwork institutions and modular individuals. Our analysis leads us to
   dissociate agency from individuals and view it as a capacity or quality
   that stems from resources, rights and obligations tied to the roles and
   social positions actors occupy. Roles and social positions are
   institutionally engineered. It is social actors qua occupants of roles
   and positions (not individuals) that enter the social stage' and

Volume = {28},

Pages = {744-759},

Abstract = {Crowdsourcing (CS) by cultural and heritage institutions engage
   volunteers in online projects without monetary compensation. Uncertainty
   concerning online volunteer motivation has led to a growing body of
   academic research. This study contributes to that debate, by extending
   focus to CS volunteer work in nonprofit cultural institutions where no
   monetary benefit is offered to volunteers. This study examines
   motivations of high performing volunteers in a newspaper digitisation CS
   project, initiated by the National Library of Australia. Volunteers are
   motivated by personal, collective, and external factors, and these
   motivations change over time. Volunteers initially show intrinsic
   motivations, though both intrinsic and extrinsic motivations play a
   critical role in their continued participation. Volunteer contributions
   range from data shaping (e.g., correcting digitised optical character
   recognition data) to knowledge shaping (e.g., shaping historical data
   through tagging and commenting, but also through development of norms
   and social roles). The locus of motivation (intrinsic or extrinsic) also
   changes with different kinds of contributions. The distinction between
   data and knowledge shaping contributions, and the locus and focus of
   motivation behind these activities, has implications for the design of
   CS systems. Design for improved usability through cognitive and physical
   system affordances and development of social mechanisms for ongoing
   participation is discussed.},

Abstract = {Research summarySocial-benefit markets, such as those for carbon
   trading, are becoming increasingly popular for combating complex social
   and environmental problems. However, their unique characteristics pose
   substantial challenges to market creation and require novel
   entrepreneurial approaches. Integrating the entrepreneurship literature
   with that of management information systems, we conceptualize
   social-benefit markets as a new type of interorganizational arrangement
   and develop a model of social-benefit market creation. First, we argue
   that a core entrepreneurial collective, comprising a plurality of actors
   from government, business, and social movements, is essential. Second,
   we elaborate a six-phase process through which the interests of
   entrepreneurs are aligned and inscribed in a market artifact and the
   market is formed. The model is illustrated with reference to the Western
   Climate Initiative's carbon market creation efforts.
   Managerial summaryCarbon markets have become a popular strategy for
   reducing greenhouse gas emissions, with similar market-based solutions
   being proposed for other social and environmental challenges. We refer
   to these new structures as social-benefit markets. Social-benefit market
   creation is a complex undertaking that will require novel
   entrepreneurial approaches and new interorganizational information
   systems. In an effort to reduce some of this complexity, we propose a
   model to explain how entrepreneurs from government, business, and social
   movements must work collectively to build social-benefit markets. We
   further elaborate a six-phase process through which entrepreneurs are
   able to align their diverse interests and create a stable market
   artifact. For managers from all sectors, our work offers actionable
   guidance for forming collective ventures that deliver real social
   benefits. Copyright (c) 2017 Strategic Management Society},

   case study of the Sialkot football-manufacturing cluster in Pakistan
   indicates that donor-funded support of CSR initiatives in industrial
   clusters in developing countries may be short-lived, due to the
   political economy of aid, the national context of CSR implementation,
   tensions within SME networks, and negative perceptions of CSR by the
   cluster-based SMEs themselves. The findings and implications of this
   analysis can inform both research and policy making in this area.},

Abstract = {Chinese consumers comprise a unique subculture that exerts a
   considerable influence on the market and are treated as a collective
   group by researchers. However, few studies have examined the effects of
   collectivism and consumer attitudinal attributes on consumer ethics.
   Although the practice of religion was prohibited in China before
   economic reforms in the late 1970s, religion remains a major factor that
   affects the ethical judgment of consumers. The present study, based on
   the Hunt-Vitell model, examines the influence of culture (collectivism
   and religion) and personal characteristics (attitude toward business) on
   consumer ethics. A total of 284 Chinese consumers were surveyed.
   Structural equation modeling was used to test hypothesized relationships
   in the research model. The results indicate that collectivism had a
   significant explanatory power for four dimensions of consumer ethical
   beliefs: (a) actively benefiting from illegal activities; (b) passively
   benefiting from questionable activities; (c) actively benefiting from
   deceptive legal activities; and (d) engaging in no harm and no foul
   activities. However, consumer attitude toward business significantly
   explained only the passive dimension of consumer ethics, and religious
   beliefs significantly explained only the active dimension of consumer
   ethical beliefs.},

Abstract = {While people's willingness to work hard can be reduced in teams (i.e.,
   effort losses in teams as compared with individual work), it is less
   recognized that teamwork can also stimulate additional efforts (i.e.,
   effort gains). Building on and extending existing theory, we (a) suggest
   an integration of these two research streams, and (b) provide evidence
   for team-related effort gains in action teams. In a first study, we
   tested our predictions by reanalyzing a field data set of 302,576
   swimming performances in individual and relay races (Neugart \&
   Richiardi, 2013). Consistent with our hypotheses, we observed a linear
   increase in effort across the relay. The first relay swimmers showed
   effort losses in the relay as compared with the individual competition
   whereas the remaining relay swimmers showed effort gains. However, this
   was only evident (a) when team members could realistically expect
   meaningful team outcomes in return for their performance, and (b) when
   the valence of these outcomes was equivalent to individual competitions.
   If such favorable conditions were not given, we found effort losses in
   team as compared with individual competitions at all relay positions.
   Results of a second study (N = 228) showed that the linear increase in
   effort across the relay was indeed attributable to the team members'
   serial position and not to their relative strength. Together, the
   studies demonstrate the motivating potential of teamwork even in the
   high performance contexts of action teams, such as competitive sports
   relays, where athletes are already highly motivated in their individual
   competitions.},

Abstract = {Signaling theory suggests that resources such as firm reputation can
   send multiple signals that create dual pressures on stakeholders. These
   tensions are apparent when examining the relationship between a firm's
   reputation and the collective voluntary turnover rates it experiences.
   On the one hand, a favorable reputation may tether employees to the firm
   due to the perceived desirability of working for a reputable company,
   resulting in lower voluntary turnover rates. On the other hand, a
   favorable reputation may make employees believe they are more marketable
   and thus may serve as a stepping stone relating to higher voluntary
   turnover rates. The purpose of this study is to investigate whether and
   when reputation acts as a signal of desirability or a signal of ease of
   movement in predicting collective voluntary turnover rates. We find some
   evidence for an overall tethering effect for more reputable firms. In
   addition, our findings demonstrate that reputation is more likely to
   result in stepping stone effects in certain signaling environments
   including when firms are in more munificent industries, are younger, and
   have higher pay levels. Tethering effects are observed when firms are in
   less munificent industries, are older, and have lower pay levels.},

Abstract = {We conducted a longitudinal field study of nine nascent ventures
   attempting to revitalize local municipalities to understand how and why
   identity processes shape organizing in multi-founder nascent ventures.
   We develop grounded theory and a process model showing how the
   patterning of founders' social and role identities shapes early
   structuring processes, how this in turn influences the construction of a
   collective identity prototype and its attempted enforcement by an
   in-group, and how the overall process influences whether or not founders
   remain engaged in their joint organizing efforts. In some cases,
   founders' identities adjust as they experience periods of pragmatic
   deference, contestation, and domination by an in-group that moves
   increasingly toward identity homophily. Our contributions extend the
   growing entrepreneurship literature on founder identity from an
   individual focus toward understanding how founding teams work through
   organizing issues, and from a focus on established organizations to
   exploring why and whether teams move forward in nascent ventures. We
   open up a series of important questions for future research about how
   founders become ``who we are.{''}},

Title = {DISCORDANT VS. HARMONIOUS SELVES: THE EFFECTS OF IDENTITY CONFLICT AND

Journal = {ACADEMY OF MANAGEMENT JOURNAL},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {60},
Number = {6},
Pages = {2208-2238},
Month = {DEC 1},
Abstract = {Across multiple studies, we examine how identity conflict and
   enhancement within people affect performance in tasks that involve
   interactions between people. We also examine two mechanisms:
   role-immersion, operationalized as intrinsic motivation, and
   role-taking, operationalized as perspective-taking. In Study 1, a
   longitudinal field study of customer service representatives (n = 763)
   who simultaneously identify with multiple brands they represent to
   customers, we examine the relationships between identity conflict and
   enhancement, on the one hand, and objective sales performance, on the
   other. We find independent effects for identity conflict and enhancement
   on intrinsic motivation, perspective-taking and performance, such that
   identity conflict negatively and enhancement positively affects all
   three variables above and beyond average identification. Intrinsic
   motivation further mediates the relationships between identity conflict
   and enhancement on sales in a direction consistent with our theorizing.
   However, while significant, perspective-taking does not mediate these
   relationships in the expected direction, because it has a negative
   effect on sales. In Studies 2a and 2b, we strengthen causal inference
   using an experimental moderation-of-process approach to constructively
   replicate and extend our findings. The paper demonstrates how multiple
   identities within people can have consequences for performance in tasks
   that involve interactions between people.},

Journal = {MIS QUARTERLY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {41},
Number = {4},
Pages = {1153+},

Abstract = {In this paper, we argue that the use of technology is structured not
   only by users, technology, and social context, but also by onlookers
   (i.e., actors for whom the use is visible, but who are not directly
   involved in the activities of use themselves). Building on the
   ``technology-in-practice{''} lens and insights of an ethnographic study
   in operating rooms where nurses used mobile technology for various
   work-related and recreational purposes, we show how onlookers contribute
   to structuring collective patterns of technology use. We conceptualize
   their role as the onlooker effect, which means that onlookers'
   inferences, judgments, and reactions trigger users to reflect on
   consequences and adjust the use in front of others, a phenomenon which
   is activated by the cues unintentionally given off when using
   technology. By identifying the role of onlookers in technology use, this
   study goes beyond user-centric and feature-centric perspectives on
   information technology use, illustrating that it does not happen in a
   physical vacuum, but often draws in unintended audiences. The onlooker
   effect provides a more in-depth explanation for unexpected patterns of
   technology use emerging in the workplace.},

Abstract = {Using an inductive study of 41 gourmet food trucks, we develop theory
   about how firms form a strategic group identity that shapes both
   competitive and cooperative behaviors among its members. Based on an
   analysis of group prototypes, we find that members cooperate to help
   each other meet the central tendencies of the group-the properties that
   typical group members have-and yet compete to strive for the ideal
   tendencies of the group-the attributes of members held in highest
   regard. These competitive and cooperative dynamics lead to three
   surprising consequences in light of previous research on strategic
   groups: (1) existing members of the strategic group help new firms enter
   the market; (2) resource scarcity leads to cooperation, not competition;
   and (3) when competition does emerge, it focuses on status within the
   group and not on price. To make sense of these empirical puzzles, we
   develop theory around the micro identity processes that allow a
   strategic group's identity to persist and to shape its member firms'
   behaviors, which alters how scholars understand the inner workings of
   strategic groups and their impact on both firms and markets.},

   MICROBLOGGING USE DURING THE GULF OF MEXICO OIL SPILL},
Journal = {MIS QUARTERLY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {41},
Number = {4},
Pages = {1179-1205},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {This research questions how social media use affords new forms of
   organizing and collective engagement. The concept of connective action
   has been introduced to characterize such new forms of collective
   engagement in which actors coproduce and circulate content based upon an
   issue of mutual interest. Yet, how the use of social media actually
   affords connective action still needed to be investigated.
   Mixed methods analyses of microblogging use during the Gulf of Mexico
   oil spill bring insights onto this question and reveal in particular how
   multiple actors enacted emerging and interdependent roles with their
   distinct patterns of feature use. The findings allow us to elaborate
   upon the concept of connective affordances as collective level
   affordances actualized by actors in team interdependent roles.
   Connective affordances extend research on affordances as a relational
   concept by considering not only the relationships between technology and
   users but also the interdependence type among users and the effects of
   this interdependence onto what users can do with the technology. This
   study contributes to research on social media use by paying close
   attention to how distinct patterns of feature use enact emerging roles.
   Adding to IS scholarship on the collective use of technology, it
   considers how the patterns of feature use for emerging groups of actors
   are intricately and mutually related to each other.},

   equation modeling to test the moderated mediation model. Results
   indicated that ethical leadership was positively related to loyalty to
   supervisor, interactional justice mediated the relationship between
   ethical leadership and loyalty to supervisor, and collectivistic
   orientation moderated the relationship between ethical leadership and
   interactional justice. Moreover, collectivistic orientation moderated
   the strength of the indirect effect of ethical leadership on loyalty to
   supervisor (through interactional justice), and the mediated
   relationship was stronger for high collectivistic subordinates than for
   low collectivistic subordinates. Theoretical and practical implications

Title = {Beyond personal control: When and how executives' beliefs in negotiable
   fate foster entrepreneurial orientation and firm performance},
Journal = {ORGANIZATIONAL BEHAVIOR AND HUMAN DECISION PROCESSES},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {143},
Pages = {69-84},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Negotiable fate, the belief that fate imposes boundaries within which
   personal actions can shape outcomes, is rooted in Chinese collective
   wisdom. This belief is hypothesized to prompt executives to use of
   available resources to create opportunities by directing their attention
   to controllable aspects of unpredictable environments. Thus, executives'
   endorsement of negotiable fate beliefs is expected not only to enhance
   firm-level entrepreneurial orientation, but also to positively predict
   firm innovation and financial performance. We further expect these
   mediation effects to be stronger under dynamic environments. Studies of
   top executives in China support the theorized moderated-mediation model.
   By providing evidence for its context-specific benefits, the concept of
   negotiable fate enhances the dialogue on fate beliefs in the Chinese
   context and suggests new directions for organizational behavior
   scholarship beyond China. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

   for theory advancement},

Pages = {1-7},

Abstract = {China plays a central role in the world economy, and it is important for
   management scholars to focus attention on the issues and challenges it
   faces. For this purpose, we argue, a phenomenon-based approach is
   required. We review the central tenets of phenomenon-based research
   (PBR), arguing that a clear focus on important phenomenon (rather than
   just testing a prior theories) enhances our understanding of the world,
   encourages different research methods, and in the end actually produces
   better theory as well. PBR on China helps us see, and study, the
   critical phenomena of generational value shifts, pollution, aging of the
   population, corruption, and mistrust of strangers. It also forces us to
   grapple with Chinese paradoxes, like the odd combination of hard work
   despite high belief in fate, and the ways in which our mainstream
   theories can and should be updated to address key Chinese phenomenon,
   like Guanxi. This special issue documents key phenomena in China that
   management scholars need to know about, and provides stimulus for
   advancing theory that not only is germane to China, but also informs and
   reshapes general management theory.},

Abstract = {We develop a search model of marriage where men and women draw utility
   from private consumption and leisure, and from a non-market good that is
   produced in the home using time resources. We condition individual
   decisions on wages, education, and an index of family attitudes. A
   match-specific, stochastic bliss shock induces variation in matching
   given wages, education, and family values, and triggers renegotiation
   and divorce. Using BHPS (1991-2008) data, we take as given changes in
   wages, education, and family values by gender, and study their impact on
   marriage decisions and intrahousehold resource allocation. The model
   allows to evaluate how much of the observed gender differences in labor
   supply results from wages, education, and family attitudes. We find that
   family attitudes are a strong determinant of comparative advantages in
   home production of men and women, whereas education complementarities
   induce assortative mating through preferences.},

Abstract = {Community differences in organizing capacity have been attributed to
   cohesion and trust among population members and from population members
   to organizations and have been seen as an enduring feature of
   communities. The experience of a crisis, and the handling of the crisis,
   can be seen as a test of cohesion that verifies community support of
   organizations or proves its absence. Using data on two bank panics 14
   years apart, we explore whether a crisis event affects whether banks in
   a community handle the subsequent crisis through community collective
   action or through executing interorganizational solutions. We find that
   banks are less likely to seek community support when a prior financial
   crisis exposes the lack of trust from community members but are more
   likely to do so when having the experience of successfully avoiding a
   looming crisis. Organizational memory carries past experience into the
   future, and the banks that have directly experienced the absence of
   community trust prefer an interorganizational solution for the next
   financial crisis.},

Number = {6},
Pages = {1115-1133},
Month = {NOV-DEC},
Abstract = {What role do social connections play in the labor market? A vast,
   influential literature has detailed the ways in which ties facilitate
   the flow of information about job opportunities to workers as well as
   endorsements or referrals of workers to firms. We propose that this role
   is not constrained to an informational one alone. Rather, relationships
   between workers can enable a collective job-matching process that
   facilitates the transfer of shared human capital from one organization
   to another. Yet ``comobility{''} has been studied only occasionally and
   among elite workers in particular industries. This study delivers both
   fieldwork as well as large-sample analysis among all nongovernmental
   workers in Denmark, finding a 5.5\% wage premium for those who move
   jointly instead of independently, both in the full sample as well as
   when applying strict matching or fixed effects for workers or firms.
   Co-movers whose skills are related but not identical capture a higher
   premium, and the wage gains associated with comobility are not limited
   to highly skilled workers but rather obtain across a wide range of
   occupations. Robustness tests establish that the wage premium associated
   with comobility is not driven by efforts to capture ``prized{''}
   workers, by employee referrals, or by aggressive hiring by firms. This
   study provides the first quantification of the anticipated value of
   comobility, suggesting that both workers and firms may want to revisit
   individualistic assumptions about how labor markets function. More
   broadly, our findings show that social relationships can transfer not
   only information but jointly held human capital across organizational
   boundaries.},

Abstract = {Corporate codes of ethics, which have spread in the last decades, have
   shown a limited ability to foster ethical behaviors. For instance, they
   have been criticized for relying too much on formal compliance, rather
   than taking into account sufficiently agents and their moral
   development, or promoting self-reflexive behaviors. We aim here at
   showing that a code of ethics in fact has meaning and enables ethical
   progress when it is interpreted and appropriated with practical wisdom.
   We explore a model that represents an uncommon organizational code of
   ethics: the monastic Rule of St. Benedict, written in the sixth century
   and still used today. Our empirical study-conducted in several
   monasteries living under this rule-shows that organization members
   interpret this rule, both hermeneutically and ethically, to adapt it to
   situations. They also appropriate this rule as a way of life and treat
   it as a dynamic framework that helps them to follow their purpose within
   their organization. This exceptional code actually offers an alternative
   model for practicing codes of ethics, in a virtue-ethical manner, beyond
   mere compliance with the text. The way in which reflexive and active
   agents practice the code, both individually and collectively, shapes
   their organizational experience and fosters their moral development.},

   accessibility of stereotypic knowledge when concepts of the elderly are
   primed},
Journal = {ORGANIZATIONAL BEHAVIOR AND HUMAN DECISION PROCESSES},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {143},
Pages = {23-38},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The processing strategies that are activated by cultural mindsets can
   influence the type of stereotypic knowledge that people draw upon when
   they encounter a member of a social category. Five experiments show that
   participants with a collectivist mindset are less likely to use trait
   descriptions and respond more slowly to traits when they are primed with
   a concept of the elderly than when they are not. However, they are more
   likely to use trait-related behaviors and respond more quickly to
   behaviors in the former condition. These differences suggest that
   cultural mindsets do not simply affect the likelihood of applying
   stereotypes. In addition, they influence the type of stereotypic
   knowledge that comes to mind when people encounter a member of a
   stereotyped group. This has important implications for how elderly
   employees are judged and treated in an organizational setting. (C) 2016

Abstract = {Capitalizing on the operational concept of division-of-labor, clinics
   often reduce physician service time by off-loading some of his/her
   clinical activities to lower-cost personnel. These personnel, such as
   nurse practitioners and physician assistants, are often collectively
   referred to as ``mid-level providers{''} (MLPs) and can perform many
   patient-consultation tasks. The common rationale is that using an MLP
   allows the physician to serve more patients, increase patients' access
   to care, and, due to MLPs' lower salaries, improve the clinic's
   financial performance. An MLP is typically integrated into the
   outpatient clinic process in one of two modes: as an ``ice-breaker,{''}
   seeing each patient before the physician, or as a ``standalone{''}
   provider, a substitute for the physician for the entirety of some
   patients' visits. Despite both of these modes being widely used in
   practice, we find no research that identifies the circumstances under
   which either one is preferable. This study examines these two modes'
   effects on operational performance, such as patient flow and throughput,
   as well as on financial measures. Using queueing and bottleneck
   analysis, discrete-event simulation, and profit modeling, we compare
   these two deployment modes and identify the optimal policies for
   deploying MLPs as either ice-breakers or as standalone providers.
   Interestingly, we also find there exists a range of scenarios where not
   hiring an MLP at all (i.e., the physician works alone) is likely to be
   most profitable for the clinic. Implications for practice are discussed.},

Abstract = {Materialism has an ugly face. The dominant view of materialism regards
   materialists as self-prioritizing individuals who oppose collective and

   status. The present research argues that there is a side of materialism
   that is concerned with collective-oriented interests. We examine the
   nature and consequences of collective-oriented materialism - the belief
   system that ascribes importance to possessions for their symbolic and
   signaling capacities to construct desirable social attributes. Drawing
   from cultural and consumer theories, we find considerable support that
   materialists espouse a collective-oriented quality to an otherwise
   self-oriented interest towards possessions.},

Abstract = {Corporations are increasingly influential within societies worldwide,
   while the relative capacity of national governments to meet large social
   needs has waned. Consequentially, firms face social pressures to adopt
   responsibilities that have traditionally fallen to governments, aid
   agencies, and other types of organizations. There are questions, though,
   about whether this is beneficial for society. We study this in the
   context of disaster relief and recovery, in which companies account for
   a growing share of aid, as compared to traditional providers. Drawing on
   the dynamic capabilities literature, we argue that firms are more able
   than other types of organizations to sense areas of need following a
   disaster, seize response opportunities, and reconfigure resources for
   fast, effective relief efforts. As such, we predict that, while
   traditional aid providers remain important for disaster recovery, relief
   will arrive faster and nations will recover more fully when locally
   active firms account for a larger share of disaster aid. We test our
   predictions with a proprietary data set comprising information on every
   natural disaster and reported aid donation worldwide from 2003 to 2013.
   Using a novel, quasi-experimental technique known as the ``synthetic
   control method,{''} our analysis shows that nations benefit greatly from
   corporate involvement when disaster strikes.},

Title = {Understanding Firms' Approaches to Voluntary Certification: Evidence

Volume = {145},

Abstract = {Voluntary certifications, such as Forestry Stewardship Council (FSC) in
   the forestry sector, are used to manage sustainable and socially
   responsible practices in firms. Even though the certifications are based
   on standards, it has been reported that adopting firms are nothing but a
   homogeneous cohort of adopters and in fact differ in their approaches to
   the certification. In this paper, we conceptualize firms' approach to
   certification and link the approaches to various aspects of
   certification. Using an inductive approach and deriving our data from
   multiple case studies from forestry FSC certification, we argue that
   firms' approach to certification is explained by their development of
   absorptive capacity, alignment of their organizational routines and
   their engagement in negotiations with FSC. We also argue that these
   approaches affect firm's benefits from certification, their level of
   adherence to the requirements of the certification and their likelihood
   to withdraw from the certification. We discuss our findings in view of
   the literature on absorptive capacity, institutional literature and the
   literature on collective action and also discuss the implications of the
   study to voluntary certification literature in general.},

Abstract = {Collective intelligence has been described as a general factor that
   ``explains a group's performance on a wide variety of tasks{''}
   (Woolley, Chabris, Pentland, Hashmi, \& Malone, 2010, p. 686), much like
   the general intelligence factor explains individuals' performance on
   cognitive ability tasks. This construct has received widespread
   attention in both the media and academic community. In this article we
   reexamine the data from 6 previously published samples that have been
   used to examine the existence of the collective intelligence construct
   and show that the empirical support for the construct is generally weak.
   Specifically, we show that the general factor explains only little
   variance in the performance on many group tasks. We also highlight how 2
   statistical artifacts-the apparent presence of low effort responding and
   the nested nature of the data-may also have inflated the little
   covariation that exists between group performance on different tasks.
   These findings suggest that there is insufficient support for the
   existence of a collective intelligence construct.},

Title = {Strong Reciprocity in Consumer Boycotts},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ETHICS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {145},
Number = {3},
Pages = {509-524},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Boycotts are among the most frequent forms of consumer expression
   against unethical or egregious acts by firms. Most current research
   explains consumers' decisions to participate in a boycott using a
   universal cost-benefit model that mixes instrumental and expressive
   motives. To date, no conceptual framework accounts for the distinct
   behavioral motives for boycotting though. This article focuses on
   motivational heterogeneity among consumers. By distinguishing two stable
   behavioral models-a self-regarding type and a strongly reciprocal
   type-we introduce the notion of strong reciprocity to the boycott
   literature. We argue that the presence of strongly reciprocal consumers
   can enhance boycott success. First, in interactions with the target
   firm, strongly reciprocal consumers perceive higher levels of
   egregiousness and are more willing to engage in boycotting behavior,
   even in unfavorable strategic conditions, which provides a stable basis
   for boycotting. Second, in interactions with self-regarding consumers,
   strongly reciprocal consumers are willing to sanction those others,
   according to whether they participate in the boycott, which increases
   overall participation in and the likelihood of success of a consumer
   boycott. These findings have implications for further research, as well
   as for firms, nongovernmental organizations, and boycotters.},

Abstract = {Despite the increasing deployment of formalized boundary spanning roles
   and practices, the mechanisms and dynamics of their legitimation remain
   under-explored. Using the Bourdieusian lens, we theorize legitimation of
   boundary spanning as accumulation, mobilization and conversion of
   several forms of capital unfolding in a configuration of intersecting
   fields. Drawing on a qualitative longitudinal case study of a
   collaborative partnership between a university and healthcare
   organizations, we describe changes in the structure, sources and mutual
   convertibility of capital assets over time. We also analyse the
   implications of this evolution for the relationships between the
   intersecting fields and the social trajectory of boundary spanners. We
   argue that legitimation of boundary spanning roles and practices is a
   highly transformative, collective and political process that increases
   the capital endowments and authority of individual boundary spanning
   agents but may lead to the erosion of the very same roles and practices
   that were being legitimized.},

   operationalize the one person, one vote principle by demanding every

   analysis differs from previous ones by considering intervals of
   alternatives. New reasons lead to an old conclusion: weights should be
   proportional to the square root of constituency sizes if voter

   fragile, however, in that preference polarization along constituency

Abstract = {Today's corporations are increasingly engaging in efforts to address
   societal concerns ranging from hunger and poverty to education and
   financial stability, predominantly through corporate volunteering. Yet,
   because research has been focused on the individual volunteer we still
   know relatively little about how corporate volunteering can help address
   grand challenges. In this study, we introduce the concept of ``corporate
   volunteering climate{''} in order to examine the broader, more
   system-level functioning of corporate volunteering in workplaces.
   Drawing on the sense-making process, we theorize about how this climate
   develops-to what extent is it driven by company-level policies versus
   employee convictions for a cause? We also explore the potential
   influence of corporate volunteering climate for volunteers and
   non-volunteers, in terms of the workplace (through employee affective
   commitment) and the community (through employee intentions to volunteer,
   whether through corporate opportunities or personally). The results of a
   study conducted with United Way Worldwide suggest that corporate
   volunteering climate arises through both employee belief in the cause
   and corporate policies, and that these forces act as substitutes for
   each other. Moreover, by fostering a sense of collective pride among
   employees, this climate is related to affective commitment, and
   corporate and personal volunteering intentions.},

Title = {Ripple Effects of CEO Awards: Investigating the Acquisition Activities
   of Superstar CEOs' Competitors},
Journal = {STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT JOURNAL},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {38},
Number = {10},
Pages = {2080-2102},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {This study proposes that CEOs may undertake intensive acquisition
   activities to increase their social recognition and status after
   witnessing their competitors' winning CEO awards. Using a sample of U.S.
   S\&P 1,500 firm CEOs, we.find that CEOs engage in more intensive
   acquisition activities in the period after their competitors won CEO
   awards (i.e., postaward period), compared to the preaward period.
   Moreover, this effect is stronger when focal CEOs themselves had a high
   likelihood of winning CEO awards. Ourfindings also show that
   acquisitions by focal CEO firms in the postaward period realize lower
   announcement returns compared to acquisitions by the same CEOs in the
   preaward period.
   Managerial summary: Each year a few CL'Os receive CEO awards from
   business media and CEOs who receive such awards become instant
   celebrities, that is, superstar CEOs. This study explores how superstar
   CEOs' competitors react to not winning CEO awards. We find that
   superstar CEOs' competitors undertake more intensive acquisition
   activities in the postaward period compared to the preaward period. This
   is particularly true for competitors who were close, yet did not win CEO
   awards. In addition, acquisitions by superstar CEOs' competitors are
   associated with lower announcement returns in the postaward compared to
   the preaward period. These.findings collectively indicate that
   acquisitions may be used as a channel for superstar CEOs' competitors to
   elevate their own social status, but at a cost to shareholders.

Abstract = {In this article I develop relational models leadership theory, which
   explains how shared cognition produces group-level leadership emergence
   effects. I propose that contextual features present early in a group's
   life can cause members to quickly converge on one of two cognitive
   relational models for leadership. Some groups adopt an authority ranking
   model, in which leadership influence is consolidated in the hands of a
   few high-status members. Others adopt a communal sharing model, in which
   leadership is the collective responsibility of all members. A positive
   feedback loop develops between group members' relational model
   convergence and leadership emergence such that members enact leadership
   in a manner consistent with their shared relational model, and these
   interactions reinforce the model. I also identify two types of
   ``jolt{''} events that can radically shift group members' cognitions and
   actions related to leadership.},

Abstract = {Peer-to-peer markets, collectively known as the sharing economy, have
   emerged as alternative suppliers of goods and services traditionally
   provided by long-established industries. The authors explore the
   economic impact of the sharing economy on incumbent firms by studying
   the case of Airbnb, a prominent platform for short-term accommodations.
   They analyze Airbnb's entry into the state of Texas and quantify its
   impact on the Texas hotel industry over the subsequent decade. In
   Austin, where Airbnb supply is highest, the causal impact on hotel
   revenue is in the 8\%-10\% range; moreover, the impact is nonuniform,
   with lowerpriced hotels and hotels that do not cater to business
   travelers being the most affected. The impact manifests itself primarily
   through less aggressive hotel room pricing, benefiting all consumers,
   not just participants in the sharing economy. The price response is
   especially pronounced during periods of peak demand, such as during the
   South by Southwest festival, and is due to a differentiating feature of
   peerto-peer platforms-enabling instantaneous supply to scale to meet
   demand.},

Abstract = {China is not meeting its international obligations to protect
   intellectual property rights (IPRs), harming the innovation process in
   China and elsewhere. We review the benefits of IPR protection and
   discuss the magnitude and cost of China's IPR violations. We also
   emphasize that these violations undermine the international rule of law
   and impair China's legitimacy as a leader in evolving global governance
   institutions. We criticize the argument that China will endogenously
   improve IPR protection due to internal pressures from its domestic IP
   sector as the United States and some other countries did in the past.
   China's governance institutions are very different from those of the
   liberal Western democracies, past and present, as China has a weak
   internal rule of law, a fragmented governance system, and cultural
   traditions that favor collective over individual rights. As China's IP
   sector develops, its IPR governance regime might even be used as a
   strategic tool to further disadvantage foreign IPR holders. We argue
   that China should play a lead role in any international IPR reforms but
   that it must first establish legitimacy by meeting its current
   international IPR commitments. We conclude that other countries should
   take action to pressure China to meet its IPR obligations.},

Abstract = {The development of women's entrepreneurship has positive implications
   for societal and economic growth. In this study, we examine the effects
   of culture and, more specifically, collectivism on women's businesses.
   With a mixed-method and multilevel approach, we conducted a quantitative
   country-level analysis followed by a qualitative study of women
   entrepreneurs. Our results indicate that collectivism at the in-group
   level (family and close friends and colleagues) is a particularly
   important predictor of women's business ownership. Furthermore, it is a
   balance of both collectivism and individualism at the in-group level
   that is most conducive to women's business ownership. Institutional
   collectivism (at the societal level) acts as a background condition that
   influences the way in which in-group collectivism directly affects
   women's business ownership. More specifically, when engaging in business
   development, women are primarily influenced by their in-groups. The
   freedom to pursue individual goals, combined with support from the
   in-group, provides the most beneficial environment for women to develop
   businesses, especially in societal-level cultures at the extreme ends of
   the collectivism spectrum-highly collectivistic or highly
   individualistic. A better understanding of these cultural factors should
   help with designing better business development training programs for
   women entrepreneurs and properly advising policy makers.},

Abstract = {Our study offers an understanding of how middle managers may use
   routines as tools to induce their subordinates to engage in widespread
   unethical behavior. We conducted a 15-month ethnography at a desk sales

   about the unit's performance. Based upon our findings and relying on the
   routine dynamics literature, we propose that middle managers engaged in
   a process that we label ``corruptive routine translation.{''} It
   involves the translation by middle managers of upper management's more
   abstract and higher level performance routine into a corrupted, lower
   level version of that routine that is enacted by frontline employees. In
   corruptive routine translation, middle managers respond to performance
   obstacles by identifying and exploiting structural vulnerabilities to
   generate and conceal deceptive performance. We also illustrate how
   routines are interdependent across levels within an organization's
   hierarchy, implicating upper management, middle management, and lower
   level employees in the collective phenomenon that is the social
   production of deceit. Our model contributes to the routines dynamics
   literature as well as to the literature on ethics at work by
   highlighting the corruptive routine translation process through which
   middle managers use routines as tools to induce deceptive performance in
   their subordinates.},

Abstract = {This paper examines when and how a critical mass of social and political
   stakeholders mobilizes against a corporate organization and the impact
   of such mobilization on the organization's market value. Our study
   employs a dataset of more than 51,000 media-reported events describing
   the interactions among almost 2,300 political, social, and economic
   stakeholders and 19 gold-mining firms trading on the Toronto Stock
   Exchange and operating mines in emerging markets around the world. We
   first examine the conditions and dynamics that explain whether an
   isolated, stakeholder-initiated negative statement or action-a ``spark''
   or critical event-goes unnoticed or escalates into a cascade of
   stakeholder reactions targeting the firm. Second, we examine whether
   such sparks and the ensuing cascades of stakeholder reactions affect
   shareholders' valuation of the firm. We argue and show empirically that
   both stakeholders' and shareholders' reactions following critical events
   are largely influenced by stakeholders' prior beliefs about the target
   organization and by peer stakeholders' reactions to the critical event.
   Stakeholders with positive beliefs about the firm before the critical
   event mobilize to defend it, and those with negative prior beliefs
   reinforce their opposition. Shareholders also take note of the other
   stakeholders' prior beliefs and react negatively to critical events if
   the firm has a history of conflict with its stakeholders. Thus
   unconnected or loosely connected stakeholders who reveal their beliefs
   about a firm through public statements and actions influence each
   other's reactions to critical events and shareholders' assessments of
   the firm's value.},

Title = {Creating in the Crucibles of Nature's Fury: Associational Diversity and

Abstract = {This paper examines foundings of human services organizations after
   natural disasters such as floods, earthquakes, wildfires, hurricanes,
   and tsunamis and explains why only some communities bounce back by
   founding appropriate collective-goods organizations. Using natural
   disasters in California counties from 1990 to 2010 as shocks that
   exogenously impose a need for collective goods over and above the level
   endogenous to the community, this paper shows that a geographic
   community's local organizing capacity rests on the richness of its
   repertoire of voluntary organizing models as reflected in the diversity
   of its voluntary associations. Such diversity is even more critical when
   the type of natural disaster is more unexpected or complex (e.g., both a
   wildfire and an earthquake) in an area, and the organizational
   challenges posed are thus more novel for the community. Associational
   diversity has positive effects on both the numbers and aggregate size of
   foundings of local (non-branch, secular) human services organizations,
   and the effects are generalizable to other endogenous demand conditions
   such as poverty. Results also show how different kinds of variety can
   have opposing effects on organizing capacity after a disaster, with
   associational diversity having a positive effect, political diversity
   having a negative effect, and racial diversity having no significant
   effect, net of other factors. The paper concludes with a call for
   treating community resilience as a matter of enhancing local organizing
   capacity over centralized planning efforts when the environment is
   rapidly changing.},

Abstract = {We study a dynamic corporate investment problem where decisions have to
   be made collectively by a group of agents holding heterogeneous beliefs
   and adhering to a ``utilitarian{''} governance mechanism in which each
   agent has a given influence in the decision. In this setting we show
   that: (i)group decisions are typically dynamically inconsistent,
   (ii)dynamic inconsistency leads to inefficient underinvestment, and
   (iii)the ability to trade securities among insiders or with outsiders
   may restore efficient investment decisions but it may, in some cases,
   lead to inefficient overinvestment. Our theory can help explain the
   empirical evidence on the effect of diversity of groups, such as
   corporate boards, on firms' outcomes and, more generally, on the
   difference between group and individual behavior. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {We use a proprietary data set of financial statements collected by banks
   to examine whether economic growth is related to the use of financial
   statement verification in debt financing. Exploiting the distinct
   economic growth and contraction patterns of the construction industry
   over the years 2002-2011, our estimates reveal that banks reduced their
   collection of unqualified audited financial statements from construction
   firms at nearly twice the rate of firms in other industries during the
   housing boom period before 2008. This reduction was most severe in the
   regions that experienced the most significant construction growth. These
   trends reversed during the subsequent housing crisis in 2008-2011 when
   construction activity contracted. Moreover, using bank- and firm-level
   data, we find a strong negative (positive) relation between audited
   financial statements during the growth period, and subsequent loan
   losses (construction firm survival) during the contraction period.
   Collectively, our results reveal that macroeconomic fluctuations produce
   temporal shifts in the overall level of financial statement verification
   and temporal shifts in verification are related to bank loan portfolio
   quality and borrower performance.},

Abstract = {Effective leaders are believed to inspire followers by providing
   inclusive visions of the future that followers can identify with. In the
   present study, we examined the neural mechanisms underlying this
   process, testing key hypotheses derived from transformational and social
   identity approaches to leadership. While undergoing functional MRI,
   supporters from the two major Australian political parties (Liberal vs.
   Labor) were presented with inspirational collectiveoriented and
   noninspirational personal-oriented statements made by in-group and
   out-group leaders. Imaging data revealed that inspirational (rather than
   noninspirational) statements from in-group leaders were associated with
   increased activation in the bilateral rostral inferior parietal lobule,
   pars opercularis, and posterior midcingulate cortex: brain areas that
   are typically implicated in controlling semantic information processing.
   In contrast, for out-group leaders, greater activation in these areas
   was associated with noninspirational statements. In addition,
   noninspirational statements by in-group (but not out-group) leaders
   resulted in increased activation in the medial prefrontal cortex, an
   area typically associated with reasoning about a person's mental state.
   These results show that followers processed identical statements
   qualitatively differently as a function of leaders' group membership,
   thus demonstrating that shared identity acts as an amplifier for
   inspirational leadership communication.},

Abstract = {The last 15 years have witnessed renewed interest in resistance in and
   around organizations. In this essay, we offer a conceptual framework to
   thematize this burgeoning conceptual and empirical terrain. We
   critically explore scholarship that examines resistance in terms of its
   manifestations and political intent or impact. We offer four fields of
   possibility for resistance scholarship: individual infrapolitics,
   collective infrapolitics, insubordination, and insurrection (the four
   I's of resistance). We conclude by considering the relationship between
   resistance theory and praxis, and pose four questions, or provocations,
   for stimulating future resistance research and practice.},

Journal = {ORGANIZATIONAL BEHAVIOR AND HUMAN DECISION PROCESSES},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {142},

Abstract = {When should leaders announce policies that create net benefits for
   organizations, but also restrict individual member choices? We find that
   restrictive policies engender more support from stakeholders when they
   are to be implemented in the distant versus near future (Studies 1 and
   2). We find similar results when manipulating construal level instead of
   temporal distance (Study 3). The effect of temporal distance on
   attitudes toward a policy is mediated by people's attention to different
   aspects of the policy (desirability vs. feasibility, pros vs. cons, self
   vs. other) (Study 4). Furthermore, temporal distance enhances support
   for policies that are high, but not low, in desirability for the
   collective (Study 5). The evidence is consistent with Construal Level
   Theory; we also consider Rational Choice Theory as an alternative
   perspective. Our findings suggest that leaders who wish to maximize
   member support for restrictive policies should consider announcing them
   well in advance of their implementation date. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All

Title = {UNIFYING THE ROLE OF IT IN HYPERTURBULENCE AND COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE VIA
   A MULTILEVEL PERSPECTIVE OF IS STRATEGY},
Journal = {MIS QUARTERLY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {41},
Number = {3},
Pages = {937+},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {While information technology (IT) serves as a new source of sustainable
   competitive advantage for firms, it also induces hyperturbulent
   environments (or hyperturbulence) that erode that sustainable
   competitive advantage. In this paper, we posit that these contradictions
   might be due to cross-level nonlinear causality between firm-level
   IT-based strategic actions and collective-level IT-induced
   hyperturbulence. We develop a multilevel perspective of IS strategy for
   theorizing this causality, and unifying novel with established research.
   Complex adaptive systems theory is employed as the overarching framework
   for its strength in formalizing cross-level nonlinear causal paths.
   Using literature-based theorization and agent-based modeling, we
   establish two bottom-up nonlinear causal paths by which IT drives
   hyperturbulence: IT can act as an external force (i.e., component IT
   innovation) to locally instigate firm strategic actions that aggregate
   to temporary hyperturbulence or as an internal force (i.e.,
   architectural IT innovation) to drive pervasive firm strategic
   interactions that aggregate to persistent hyperturbulence. Each causal
   path produces varied amounts of reducible and irreducible uncertainties
   and thereby renders a top-down nonlinear effect that reshapes the
   opportunity for IT to contribute to competitive advantage. This
   multilevel theorization paves the way for new, IS-specific theory
   regarding IT's unique role in inducing nonlinear dynamics and in
   affording new business strategies in today's competitive environments.},

Title = {Fair pay dispersion: A regulatory focus theory view},
Journal = {ORGANIZATIONAL BEHAVIOR AND HUMAN DECISION PROCESSES},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {142},
Pages = {1-11},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The authors propose that the debate on the fairness of large pay
   dispersion can be advanced by considering people's regulatory focus.
   While some argue that pay dispersion is fair only when it reflects
   individual contribution differences, others argue that large pay
   dispersion is fair as employees perceive others' high pay as a signal of
   their own future pay. Invoking the view of regulatory focus theory, the
   authors suggest that pay dispersion increases pay fairness perception
   when employees have a strong promotion focus, whereas pay dispersion
   decreases fairness perception when employees have a strong prevention
   focus. Using two multilevel field studies Study 1 with 827 employees in
   137 teams at 42 organizations in South Korea and Study 2 with 186
   employees in 46 teams at 5 high-technology organizations in Taiwan the
   authors present supportive evidence of the promotion focus moderation
   effect. Evidence of the prevention focus moderation effect is not found.

Year = {2017},
Volume = {28},
Number = {3},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The performance of prediction markets depends crucially on the quality
   of user contribution. A social-media-based prediction market can utilize
   aspects of social effects to improve users' contribution quality. In
   this study, we examine the causal effect of social audience size and
   online endorsement on prediction market participants' prediction
   accuracy through a randomized field experiment. By conducting a
   comprehensive treatment effect analysis, we estimate both the average
   treatment effect (ATE) and the quantile treatment effect using the
   difference-in-differences method. Our empirical results on ATE show that
   an increase in audience size leads to an improvement in prediction
   accuracy, and that a higher level of online endorsement also leads to
   prediction improvements. Interestingly, we find that the quantile
   treatment effects are heterogeneous: users of intermediate prediction
   ability respond most positively to an increase in social audience size
   and online endorsement. These findings suggest that prediction markets
   can target people of intermediate abilities to obtain the most
   significant prediction improvement.},

Abstract = {It is well known that firm-level corporate governance practices vary
   mainly between rather than within countries, but country-level factors
   such as legal and financial institutions explain less than 50\% of this
   cross-country variation. In this article we show that two dimensions of
   national culture - individualism and uncertainty avoidance - capture
   about 90\% of the country fixed effects and outperform the country-level
   explanatory variables used in prior literature. We argue that culture
   works through a tradeoff between managerial expertise and certainty of
   control, a tradeoff largely overlooked by prior literature, that
   captures a country's preference for the Anglo-Saxon approach versus the
   direct control approach for governance. Consistent with this argument,
   we find that the effect of culture on corporate governance varies across
   firms with different needs for managerial expertise and certainty of
   control. We also find that culture interacts with other factors to
   determine firm-level governance.},

Abstract = {To clarify the potential value of a targeted system of human resource
   (HR) practices, we explore the unique effects of a relationship-oriented
   HR system and the more commonly studied high commitment HR system on
   unit performance in the context of knowledge-intensive work. We develop
   theoretical arguments suggesting that the high commitment HR system
   contributes to unit performance through its positive effects on
   employees' collective organizational commitment, general and
   firm-specific human capital, and access to knowledge. We argue that the
   relationship-oriented HR system contributes to unit performance through
   its positive effects on employees' collective access to knowledge by
   fostering a social context and interpersonal exchange conditions which
   support employees' ongoing access to knowledge flows within and outside
   their unit and broader organization. Based on unit-level data collected
   from a matched sample of employees and managers in 128 units in the
   science and engineering division of a large hydroelectric power
   organization, our results suggest that the targeted,
   relationship-oriented HR system is related to firm performance and may
   complement a broader, high commitment approach to managing knowledge
   workers. Specifically, the positive relationship between the high
   commitment HR system and unit performance is mediated by employees'
   collective organizational commitment, firm-specific human capital, and
   access to knowledge in other organizational units; whereas the positive
   relationship between the relationship-oriented HR system and unit
   performance is mediated by units' access to knowledge within the unit,
   in other units, and outside the organization.},

Abstract = {We propose that it is important to take the content of team voice into
   account when examining its impact on team processes and outcomes.
   Drawing on regulatory focus theory (Higgins, 1997), we argue that
   promotive team voice and prohibitive team voice help teams achieve
   distinct collective outcomes-that is, team productivity performance
   gains and team safety performance gains, respectively. Further, we
   identify mechanisms through which promotive and prohibitive team voices
   uniquely influence team outcomes as well as boundary conditions for such
   influences. In data collected from 88 production teams, we found that
   promotive team voice had a positive association with team productivity
   performance gains. By contrast, prohibitive team voice had a positive
   association with team safety performance gains. The relationship between
   promotive team voice and team productivity performance gains was
   mediated by team innovation, and the relationship between prohibitive
   team voice and team safety performance gains was mediated by team
   monitoring. In addition, the indirect effect of prohibitive team voice
   on team safety performance gains via team monitoring was stronger when
   prior team safety performance was lower. We discuss the theoretical and
   practical implications of these findings.},

Abstract = {Few industries have been pressured to develop corporate social
   responsibility (CSR) standards and policies like oil and gas. This has
   translated into the creation of non-governmental organizations and
   branches of the oil and gas firms focused on CSR. However, given the
   intrinsic complex characteristics of this industry, its global reach,
   and the fact that its operations affect and involve a wide variety of
   stakeholders, CSR issues cannot be defined and implemented exclusively
   at the industry or firm levels, but require the participation of other
   actors affected directly or indirectly by oil and gas activities. In
   this paper we argue, first, that oil and gas CSR issues are collectively
   constructed through meta-organizations (organizations composed by other
   organizations), and, second, that the complexity and variety of CSR
   issues require companies to build industry-specific and
   non-industry-specific collective actions. Based on how oil and gas firms
   participate in this multi-level co-construction of CSR issues, we
   created a typology of meta-organizations as infra-sectoral, sectoral,
   cross-sectoral, and supra-sectoral meta-organizations.},

Title = {Groups outperform individuals in tacit coordination by using consensual
   and disjunctive salience},
Journal = {ORGANIZATIONAL BEHAVIOR AND HUMAN DECISION PROCESSES},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {141},
Pages = {74-81},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Tacit coordination between individuals has received considerable
   research attention (Mehta, Starmer, \& Sugden, 1994; Abele \& Stasser,
   2008). However, groups often must coordinate tacitly with other groups,
   and such intergroup coordination has been rarely studied. In three
   experiments, we found that interacting groups are more successful at
   coordinating tacitly than are individuals. This advantage is driven by
   two types of coordination salience that are uniquely derived from groups
   deliberating and making collective responses. Consensual salience occurs
   when groups select a response because a majority of members support it.
   Majorities efficiently identify popular response tendencies (i.e., focal
   points) and thereby increase the chances of matching other groups'
   responses. Disjunctive salience occurs when at least one member of a
   group suggests a focal point. We propose that focal points are often
   demonstratively evident when mentioned, and if proposed by any group
   member, are likely to be adopted as the group response. (C) 2017

Title = {Are Applicants More Likely to Quit Longer Assessments? Examining the
   Effect of Assessment Length on Applicant Attrition Behavior},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF APPLIED PSYCHOLOGY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {102},
Number = {7},
Pages = {1148-1158},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Conventional wisdom suggests that assessment length is positively
   related to the rate at which applicants opt out of the assessment phase.
   However, restricting assessment length can negatively impact the utility
   of a selection system by reducing the reliability of its construct
   scores and constraining coverage of the relevant criterion domain. Given
   the costly nature of these tradeoffs, is it better for managers to
   prioritize (a) shortening assessments to reduce applicant attrition
   rates or (b) ensuring optimal reliability and validity of their
   assessment scores? In the present study, we use data from 222,772
   job-seekers nested within 69 selection systems to challenge the popular
   notion that selection system length predicts applicant attrition
   behavior. Specifically, we argue that the majority of applicant
   attrition occurs very early in the assessment phase and that attrition
   risk decreases, not increases, as a function of time spent in
   assessment. Our findings supported these predictions, revealing that the
   majority of applicants who quit assessments did so within the first 20
   min of the assessment phase. Consequently, selection system length did
   not predict rates of applicant attrition. In fact, when controlling for
   observed system length and various job characteristics, we found that
   systems providing more conservative (i.e., longer) estimates of
   assessment length produced lower overall attrition rates. Collectively,
   these findings suggest that efforts to curtail applicant attrition by
   shortening assessment length may be misguided.},

Abstract = {The number and scale of business associations focused on corporate
   responsibility and sustainability has grown dramatically in recent
   decades and they are becoming influential actors in both national and
   international governance. Yet surprisingly little research exists on
   such organizations and recognition of the organizational lineage they
   share with special interest groups is yet to be examined-are industry
   business associations merely lobbies for their members' own interests or
   are they viable self-regulatory institutions capable of addressing
   contemporary social and sustainability issues? This paper identifies and
   reviews fragmented insights from literatures that address this question.
   Drawing on various streams of research within the political science,
   economics and management disciplines that provide diverse lenses on the
   phenomenon of business associations, it juxtaposes and groups them into
   two broad perspectives: business associations as special interest groups
   that are detrimental to society ({''}peril{''}); business associations
   as self-regulatory institutions capable of addressing contemporary
   challenges ({''}promise{''}).},

   contributors focused on recreation to becoming a community of trolls,
   activists and hackers incubating myriad projects. Findings reveal that
   the interplay of digital technology and a culture of transgression
   supported experimentation that culminated with the adoption of a
   resilient organizing platform that enabled several community factions to
   coexist in continuous engagement. This paper infuses community building
   research with an important emphasis on the role of the techno-cultural,

Abstract = {We study how ethical behaviour by firms leads to ethical reputation
   building. Based on our in-depth studies of two firms in India and
   Zimbabwe that resisted corruption and survived for extended time
   periods, we propose that in addition to behaving ethically, firms need
   to elicit favourable responses from a critical mass of stakeholders from
   both strong and weak tie networks in order for their ethical reputations
   to diffuse quickly and widely. We find that the strength of stakeholder
   responses to ethical behaviour is moderated by firm level and contextual
   factors: high status affiliations, industry characteristics, the nature
   of corruption resisted, the presence of a plural press, the potential
   for collective action, and the presence of an independent judiciary.
   These antecedents also influence the pattern of stakeholder resource
   commitments that firms are able to enjoy as a result of having built
   ethical reputations.},

Abstract = {Prior research on the determinants of credit ratings has focused on
   rating agencies' use of quantitative accounting information, but the
   there is scant evidence on the impact of textual attributes. This study
   examines the impact of financial disclosure narrative on bond market
   outcomes. We find that less readable financial disclosures are
   associated with less favorable ratings, greater bond rating agency
   disagreement, and a higher cost of debt. We improve causal
   identification by exploiting the 1998 Plain English Mandate, which
   required a subset of firms to exogenously improve the readability of
   their filings. Using a difference-in-differences design, we find that
   the firms required to improve the readability of their filings
   experience more favorable ratings, lower bond rating disagreement, and
   lower cost of debt. Collectively, our evidence suggests that textual
   financial disclosure attributes appear to not only influence bond market
   intermediaries' opinions but also firms' cost of debt.},

Abstract = {We develop a novel framework to analyze the structural implications of
   the marriage market for household consumption. We define a revealed
   preference characterization of efficient household consumption when the
   marriage is stable. We characterize stable marriage with intrahousehold
   (consumption) transfers but without assuming transferable utility. Our
   revealed preference characterization generates testable conditions even
   with a single observation per household and heterogeneous individual
   preferences across households. The characterization also allows for
   identifying the intrahousehold decision structure (including the sharing
   rule) under the same minimalistic assumptions. An application to Dutch
   household data illustrates the usefulness of our theoretical results.},

Abstract = {We examine the effects of the 1998 merger of Price Waterhouse (PW) and
   Coopers \& Lybrand (CL) on the audit quality of the merged firm
   PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) at both the firm and office levels, where
   audit quality is surrogated by the auditor's propensity to issue a
   going-concern opinion, clients' likelihood of meeting or beating
   analysts' earnings forecasts, and clients' accrual quality. At the firm
   level, we find that the merger increased audit quality for PwC relative
   to the audit quality of the other Big N firms. At the office level, our
   findings, albeit mixed, collectively suggest that the improvement in
   firm-level audit quality was likely driven by the improvement in audit
   quality at PwC's overlapping offices, that is, offices in cities where
   both PW and CL had separate offices prior to the merger. Further, our
   findings suggest that although the PW/CL merger increased auditor
   concentration in local audit markets with PwC overlapping offices, the
   merger improved (rather than hurt) audit quality in those markets.
   Overall, our study contributes to the extant sparse literature on the
   effect of Big N mergers on audit quality, and is of potential interest
   to regulators.},

Journal = {MIS QUARTERLY},

Volume = {41},

Abstract = {Organizations often build virtual teams to draw information from
   different parts of the organization to enable better decisions. However,
   communication patterns among virtual team members often resemble
   multiple monologues (in which team members broadcast what they know)
   rather than dialogues (in which team members mindfully share information
   they have and consider information from others). The result is that team
   members often fail to integrate the new information they receive from
   other team members into their mental models, and decision quality
   suffers. Collective mindfulness is a team-level process in which team
   members heedfully contribute to the team discussion, align their own
   actions with the actions of others, and develop shared mental models.
   Collective mindfulness is more than a sum of individual mindfulness in
   much the same way that organizational learning is more than the sum of
   the individual learning of its members. We compared teams using a
   traditional synchronous text chat tool to teams using a combination of
   tools designed to promote collective mindfulness (chat plus a
   whiteboard). The results suggest that teams using chat plus the
   whiteboard had increased collective mindfulness, and that this increased
   collective mindfulness led to improved decision quality. Not all teams
   were effective in using the whiteboard, indicating it was not the
   provision of the whiteboard that mattered, but rather how teams
   appropriated it. We identified four appropriations, the combination of
   which led to increased collective mindfulness and decision quality:
   information aggregation, discussion of information distribution,
   discussion of decision criteria, and voting. If any one of the
   appropriations was missing, collective mindfulness and decision quality
   suffered.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we use a social identity theory perspective to study the
   mechanisms through which internal and external corporate social
   responsibility (CSR) influence employee identification and its
   subsequent outcomes, as well as the boundary conditions on these
   effects. We posit that CSR actions focusing on external stakeholders
   enhance perceived prestige whereas CSR actions focusing on employee
   welfare enhance perceived respect-both of which are argued to influence
   employee organizational identification but differentially impact
   different forms of employee citizenship. These relationships were
   predicted to vary in strength, however, due to individual differences in
   social (local vs. cosmopolitan) and cultural (individualist vs.
   collectivist) orientations. Data are presented from 408 employees of a
   fast-moving consumer goods conglomerate operating in South Asia (Study
   1) and from 415 employees spanning nine companies in two culturally
   distinct regions (France and Pakistan, Study 2). The results, which
   largely support our theoretical framework, are discussed in terms of
   their implications for both our understanding of the psychology of CSR
   as well as social identity theory more generally.},

Abstract = {As more individuals are working remotely, many feel increasingly
   isolated and socially adrift. To address this challenge, many
   independent workers are choosing to work in coworking spaces - shared
   spaces where individuals do their own work but in the presence of others
   with the express purpose of being part of a community. In this
   qualitative, single case study, we analyze how members of a coworking
   space work together to co-construct a sense of community through their
   day-to-day interactions in the space. We apply a relational
   constructionist lens to unpack the processes of community work' as an
   interactive, agentic process. We identify three types of collective
   actions, or interacts, that contribute to a sense of community:
   endorsing, encountering, and engaging. These interacts represent
   different forms of community work that members interactively accomplish
   to maintain a desired community experience. The rapidly growing
   coworking movement offers insights, as uncovered in this study, on how
   to integrate a sense of community into the world of work.},

Title = {CONSUMER PSEUDO-SHOWROOMING AND OMNI-CHANNEL PLACEMENT STRATEGIES},
Journal = {MIS QUARTERLY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {41},
Number = {2},
Pages = {583+},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Recent advances in information technologies (IT) have powered the merger
   of online and offline retail channels into one single platform. Modern
   consumers frequently switch between online and offline channels when
   they navigate through various stages of the decision journey, motivating
   multichannel sellers to develop omni-channel strategies that optimize
   their overall profit. This study examines consumers' cross-channel
   search behavior of ``pseudo-showrooming,{''} or the consumer behavior of
   inspecting one product at a seller's physical store before buying a
   related but different product at the same seller's online store, and
   investigates how such consumer behavior allows a multichannel seller to
   achieve better coordination between its online and offline arms through
   optimal product placement strategies.
   We develop a stylized model in which a multichannel firm offers a
   product line consisting of two horizontally differentiated products.
   Consumers are uncertain about the true value of either product. A
   consumer's uncertainty regarding a particular product's value is fully
   resolved after inspecting that product in person, and can also be
   partially resolved after inspecting the other related product. By
   selling only one product through the dual channel and the other product
   through the online channel exclusively, the firm induces consumer
   pseudoshow-rooming for the online exclusive product. Our analysis shows
   that this product placement strategy generates a greater profit than
   selling both products through the dual channel, if the fit probability
   of individual products and consumers' cost for returning a misfit
   product are both in the intermediate range. Moreover, we find that over
   a large parameter region, consumers also enjoy a greater total surplus
   under the firm's product placement strategy that induces consumer
   pseudo-showrooming. Furthermore, we find that the firm garners the most
   benefit from inducing consumer pseudo-showrooming by selling the
   higher-quality product or the higher-demand product through the online
   channel exclusively. Collectively, our study offers a compelling
   demand-side justification of the commonly witnessed practice among
   multichannel sellers to offer products online exclusively when offline
   selling is feasible.},

Abstract = {Integrating the leader trait perspective with dominance complementarity
   theory, we propose team power distance as an important boundary
   condition for the indirect impact of leader extraversion, agreeableness,
   and conscientiousness on team performance through a team's potency
   beliefs and through relational identification with the leader. Using
   time-lagged, 3-source data from 71 teams, we found that leader
   extraversion had a positive indirect impact on team in-role and
   extrarole performance through relational identification, but only for
   high power distance teams; leader conscientiousness had a positive
   influence on team in-role performance through team potency, but only for
   high power distance teams; and leader agreeableness had a positive
   effect on team in-role and extrarole performance via relational
   identification and on team in-role performance via team potency, but
   only for low power distance teams. The findings address prior
   inconsistencies regarding the relationships between leader traits and
   team effectiveness, identify an important boundary condition and key
   team processes that bridge the links, and provide a deeper understanding
   of the role of leader traits in teams.},

Abstract = {We provide novel evidence on gender differences in insider-trading
   behavior and the profitability of senior corporate executives. On
   average, both female and male executives make positive profits from
   insider trading. Males, however, earn significantly more than females in
   equivalent positions and also trade more than females. These gender
   differences disappear when we limit the sample to firms in which female
   trading is relatively high. Collectively, these results suggest that
   female executives have a disadvantage relative to males in access to
   inside information, even if they have equal formal status, and informal
   networks may play an important role in attenuating this disadvantage.},

Abstract = {Drawing on an ethnography of software engineering teams that introduced
   a new and empowerment-centered productivity scheme, this study
   delineates how, despite management's affirmation of its commitment,
   software engineers produced and reproduced a culture of uncertainty'
   characterized by constant doubt about how long the scheme would last.
   Engineers shared previous experiences of failed productivity schemes and
   collectively used this organizational memory to understand their new
   situation. Workers drew on this organizational memory in everyday
   interaction to sustain a culture in which everyday management decisions
   served as indicators of management's potential abandonment of the
   scheme; as a result, workers remained uncommitted to the scheme. Workers
   interactionally employed organizational memory as a resource that they
   used to interpret and respond to changes. Analysis of this process shows
   the links between organizational memory, culture creation, and culture's
   influence on productivity scheme changes.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF FINANCIAL ECONOMICS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {124},
Number = {3},
Pages = {632-653},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {This paper addresses regulatory concerns that large shareholders of
   credit rating agencies can influence the rating process. Unlike Standard
   \& Poor's, which is a privately held division of McGraw-Hill, Moody's is
   a public company listed on the NYSE. From 2001 to 2010, Moody's has two
   shareholders, Berkshire Hathaway and Davis Selected Advisors, which
   collectively own about 23.5\% of Moody's. Moody's ratings on bonds
   issued by important investee firms of these two stable large
   shareholders are more favorable relative to S\&P, as well as Fitch,
   ratings. We exploit Moody's initial public offering in 2000 to address
   endogeneity and to mitigate concerns that the results are driven by
   issuer characteristics or by the greater informativeness of Moody's
   ratings. S\&P's parent, McGraw-Hill, has a large shareholder for much
   less time, and some weak evidence exists that S\&P ratings are
   relatively more favorable toward the owners of McGraw-Hill. These
   findings are consistent with regulatory concerns about the ownership and
   governance of rating agencies, especially those that are publicly
   listed. Published by Elsevier B.V.},

Abstract = {This paper explores the role of ideology in attempts to influence public
   policy and in business representation in the EU-China solar panel
   anti-dumping dispute. It exposes the dynamics of international activity
   by emerging-economy multinationals, in this case from China, and their
   interactions in a developed-country context (the EU). Theoretically, the
   study also sheds light on the recent notion of `liability of origin', in
   addition to the traditional concept of `liability of foreignness'
   explored in international business research, in relation to firms'
   market and political strategies and their institutional embeddedness in
   home and host countries. Through a qualitative analysis of primary and
   secondary materials and interview data with key protagonists, we provide
   a detailed evolution of the case, the key actors involved and their
   positions, arguments and strategies. This illustrates the complexities
   involved in the interaction between markets and ideologies in the midst
   of debates regarding different forms of subsidy regimes for renewable
   energy, free trade versus protectionist tendencies by governments, and
   the economic and sustainability objectives of firms and societies. The
   case shows how relative newcomers to the EU market responded to overcome
   a direct threat to their business and became, with support from their
   home government, active participants in the public debate through
   interactions with local commercial partners and non-governmental
   organisations. Firms adopted relatively sophisticated strategies to
   reduce their liabilities vis-A -vis host-country institutions and local
   stakeholders, including collective action, to increase their legitimacy
   and reputation, and counter ideologically based attacks. We also discuss
   implications and limitations.},

Abstract = {We explore the notion that culture influences people's values, and their
   subsequent ideologies and ethical behaviors. We present the idea that
   culture itself changes with time, and explore the influence of culture
   and generational markers on consumer ethics by examining differences in
   these ethical dimensions between Australians, Indonesians, and
   Indonesian Migrants in Australia, as well as differences between
   Generation X versus Generations Y and Z. The present study addresses the
   need to investigate the role that culture plays in consumer ethics, and
   the interaction between culture and generational attitudes in
   determining consumer ethics. Results established a distinct
   multiculturality in our three cultural samples, including a generational
   cohort differences. This suggests that culture and generational markers
   influence ethical beliefs, ideologies, and consumer ethics. It further
   indicates that Indonesian Migrants have acculturated to Australian
   society both in terms of their values and consumer behaviors,
   illustrating a crossvergence effect; scores indicate that these Migrants
   have the highest cultural intelligence among our samples. Implications
   of the findings for consumer ethics theory and practice are considered

Abstract = {We investigated how professional role identity change can be
   accomplished in highly institutionalized contexts characterized by
   resiliency. We show that the collective professional role identity of
   family physicians was changed through a process of reinterpreting
   multiple logics and their relationships. Through our inductive analyses,
   we identified four mechanisms that occurred through social interactions
   and collectively served to rearrange the constellation of logics guiding
   physician role identity: (1) revealing the influence of a hidden logic;
   (2) reinforcing the conflict between logics; (3) reframing the meaning
   of a dominant logic; and (4) re-embedding the new arrangement of logics.
   We found that the change in physician professional role identity
   required significant identity work by a group of actors, but
   particularly by the managers who had been charged with leading the
   reform initiative. We contribute to the professional role identity and
   institutional literatures by showing how others can engage in social
   interactions with professionals to facilitate the reinterpretation and
   rearranging of institutional logics that guide collective professional
   role identity.},

Abstract = {Earth's life-support system is facing megaproblems of sustainability.
   One important way of how these problems can be addressed is through
   innovation. This paper argues that responsible innovation that
   contributes to sustainable development (SD) consists of three
   dimensions: (1) innovations avoid harming people and the planet, (2)
   innovations `do good' by offering new products, services, or
   technologies that foster SD, and (3) global governance schemes are in
   place that facilitate innovations that avoid harm and `do good.' The
   paper discusses global governance schemes based on deliberation as a
   means to foster such responsible innovation. These schemes can provide
   voluntary soft-law regulations that complement and extend national and
   international hard-law regulations and facilitate collective innovation
   that contributes to SD goals. The article addresses the facilitative
   role of governments and international organizations in overcoming
   problems of deliberation and offers illustrative examples of such
   governance schemes.},

Title = {Manipulation of explicit reputation in innovation and knowledge exchange

Abstract = {This paper investigates the manipulation of reputation in the context of
   innovation and knowledge exchange communities. Reputation is crucial for
   overcoming the free-riding problem and enables community members to be
   rewarded because their contributions to the common good can be measured.
   However, the concept of reputation can include the notion of
   manipulation, which we define as the attempt to change one's reputation
   without contributing to the community. To investigate the topic of
   reputation manipulation, we build on the concept of reputation-based
   reward systems and extend it by distinguishing between implicit
   reputation, which is uncodified, and explicit reputation, which is
   codified and centrally counted. We argue that the possibilities for
   manipulation differ between these two distinctions. We investigate
   reputation manipulation empirically in the context of science, which is
   built on an explicit reputation-based reward system, and we use the
   received citations as an indicator for reputation. We distinguish two
   forms of manipulation unjustified self-citing and unjustified reciprocal
   citing and find evidence of both within a bibliometric dataset. This
   paper contributes to the design of knowledge exchange communities by
   highlighting the opportunities and challenges arising from explicit
   reputation-based reward systems, specifically the opportunities for
   manipulation. It also contributes to the work on misconduct in science.

Title = {Alliance portfolio reconfiguration following a technological
   discontinuity},
Journal = {STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT JOURNAL},

Abstract = {Research summary: We study how technological discontinuities generate
   first- and second-order effects on alliance formation and termination,
   leading to reconfiguration of firms' alliance portfolios. Following
   technological shocks, we argue that firms often seek alliances that
   provide new resources while also having incentives to form alliances for
   reinforced and challenged resources that complement the new resources.
   In parallel, alliance terminations, even involving resources otherwise
   unaffected by the discontinuity, increase due to limits in firms'
   alliance carrying capacity. We study biopharmaceutical firms between
   1990 and 2000, which faced a technological discontinuity in 1995 in the
   form of combinatorial chemistry and high-throughput screening. We
   improve understanding of how technological discontinuities affect the
   value of resources and how firms reconfigure alliance portfolios in
   response.Managerial summary: When firms form alliances to gain new
   resources during technological discontinuities that disrupt their
   industry, they cannot consider only the focal new partnerships. Instead,
   new alliances create complementarity and substitution pressures that
   lead to broader reconfiguration of the firms' alliance portfolios: (1)
   complementarity creates incentives to also form alliances for resources
   that the technological discontinuity reinforces or challenges in order
   to improve the collective value of co-specialized assets; (2)
   substitution creates incentives to terminate existing alliances, even if
   their value is otherwise unaffected by the discontinuity, in order to
   create carrying capacity for new alliances. Thus, one new alliance can
   generate a cascade of reconfiguration that challenges the balance
   between the benefits of stability and the need for change in an alliance
   portfolio. Copyright (c) 2016 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Abstract = {Research on the credit rating process has primarily focused on how
   rating agencies incorporate firm characteristics into their rating
   opinions. We contribute to this literature by examining the impact of
   managerial ability on the credit rating process. Given debt market
   participants' interest in assessing default risk, we begin by
   documenting that higher managerial ability is associated with lower
   variability in future earnings and stock returns. We then show that
   higher managerial ability is associated with higher credit ratings
   (i.e., lower assessments of credit risk). To provide more direct
   identification of the impact of managerial ability, we examine chief
   executive officer (CEO) replacements and document that ratings increase
   (decrease) when CEOs are replaced with more (less) able CEOs. Finally,
   we show that managerial ability also has capital market implications by
   documenting that managerial ability is associated with bond offering
   credit spreads. Collectively, our evidence suggests that managerial
   ability is an important factor that bond market participants impound
   into their assessments of firm credit risk.},

Volume = {43},

Abstract = {Drawing on organizational learning theory, this article examines the
   moderating influences of different forms of internal and external
   sell-off experience on the relationship between firm sell-off activity
   and subsequent firm accounting performance. The results from a
   longitudinal analysis of sell-off activity by 293 European companies
   over a 15-year period (1995-2009) are consistent with basic predictions
   from learning theory, suggesting a positive moderating influence of a
   firm's general sell-off experience. Yet, by distinguishing between
   multiple forms of learning (i.e., experiential, superstitious,
   interfirm, and vicarious learning), we further argue and find that the
   composition of a firm's general sell-off experience is of substantial
   importance. Specifically, we find that learning benefits result from the
   repeated sale of related assets, whereas high levels of experience
   heterogeneity negatively affect the relationship between firm sell-off
   activity and subsequent firm performance. Furthermore, external sell-off
   experience by advisors and by industry peers is found to positively
   influence the divestiture-firm performance linkage. Collectively, these
   findings contribute to organizational learning theory and extend prior
   research on divestiture performance.},

Abstract = {Although existing research has demonstrated the importance of attaining
   legitimacy for new market categories, few scholars have considered the
   trade-offs associated with such actions. Using the U.S. organic food
   product category as a context, we explore how one standards-based
   certification organization-the California Certified Organic Farmers
   (CCOF)-sought to balance efforts to legitimate a nascent market category
   with retaining a shared, distinctive identity among its members. Our
   findings suggest that legitimacy-seeking behaviors undertaken by the
   standards organization diluted the initial collective identity and
   founding ethos of its membership. However, by shifting the meaning of
   ``organic{''} from the producer to the product, CCOF was able to
   strengthen the categorical boundary, thereby enhancing its legitimacy.
   By showing how the organization managed the associated trade-offs, this
   study highlights the double-edged nature of legitimacy and offers
   important implications for the literatures on legitimacy and new market
   category formation.},

Abstract = {This paper introduces a configurational approach to the study of
   multiple identities. Specifically, it examines how prosocial identity
   combines with collective and individualistic identities in conflicting
   and enhancing ways to affect prosocial behavior in organizational
   settings. We examine an unexplored intuition in the multiple identities
   literature that when all identities are enhancing (a mutual enhancement
   configuration), it will be best for prosocial outcomes. Our results
   show, however-across two field studies and two experiments-that
   enhancement between prosocial and collective identities (a focused
   enhancement configuration) results in the highest levels of prosocial
   behavior. Furthermore, we trace this result to the greater self-serving
   orientation activated in a mutual enhancement configuration, where one's
   individualistic identity enhances one's other identities. Our work
   demonstrates the value of a configurational approach to the study of
   multiple identities, and it challenges the assumption that a mutual
   enhancement configuration is always desirable.},

Abstract = {Three global developments situate the context of this investigation: the
   increasing use of social media by organizations and their employees, the
   burgeoning presence of social media policies, and the heightened focus
   on corporate social responsibility (CSR). In this study the intersection
   of these trends is examined through a content analysis of 112 publicly
   available social media policies from the largest corporations in the
   world. The extent to which social media policies facilitate and/or
   constrain the communicative sensibilities and values associated with
   contemporary notions of CSR is considered. Overall, findings indicate
   that a large majority of policies, regardless of sector or national
   headquarters, increasingly inhibit communicative tenets of contemporary
   CSR (i.e., free speech, collective information sharing, and stakeholder
   engagement/dialogue) and thereby diminish employee negotiation and
   participation in the social responsibilities of corporations. Moreover,
   policies generally enact organizational communication practices that are
   contrary to international CSR guidelines (e.g., the UN Global Compact
   and other international agreements). Findings suggest that social media
   policies represent a relatively unrecognized development in the
   institutionalization of CSR communicative norms and practices that call
   into question the promising affordances of social media for the
   inclusion of various voices in the public negotiation of what
   constitutes corporate social responsibility.},

Journal = {MANAGEMENT SCIENCE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {63},
Number = {5},
Pages = {1302-1317},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {We model mental states as part of an equilibrium notion. In a mental
   equilibrium each player ``selects{''} an emotional state that determines
   the player's preferences over the outcomes of the game. These
   preferences typically differ from the players' material preferences. The
   emotional states interact to play a Nash equilibrium and, in addition,
   each player's mental state must be a best response to the mental states
   of the others (in the sense of maximizing material payoffs). We discuss
   the concept behind the definition of mental equilibrium and examine it
   in the context of some of the most popular games discussed in the
   experimental economics literature. In particular, our approach allows us
   to identify the mental states (the psychology) that lead players to play
   various prominent experimental outcomes. We provide necessary and
   sufficient conditions for mental equilibria to be sustained by material
   preferences. Finally, we discuss the concept of collective emotions,
   which is based on the idea that players can coordinate their mental
   states.},

Abstract = {Income inequality in the US has now reached levels not seen since the
   1920s. Management, as a field of scholarly inquiry, has the potential to
   contribute in significant ways to our understanding of recent inequality
   trends. We review and assess recent research, both in the management
   literature and in other fields. We then delineate a conceptual framework
   that highlights the mechanisms through which business practice (and,
   indirectly, business pedagogy and scholarship) may be linked to income
   inequality. We then outline four general areas in which management
   scholars are uniquely positioned to contribute to ongoing research: (1)
   data and description, (2) organizational dynamics, (3) collective
   action, and (4) value flows and tradeoffs. To stimulate future research,
   we highlight a number of relevant research questions and link these
   questions to existing management research streams that could be
   leveraged to address them.},

Abstract = {This article explores the intersection of branding, identity and
   control. It develops the notion of identity-incentive branding and links
   research on the collective-associative construction of occupational
   identities with work on identity incentives as an engaging form of
   control. Empirically, we draw on a case study of a North American
   grocery chain that is known for employing art-school graduates and other
   creative talents in creative (store artist) and non-creative shop-floor
   positions. The study shows that the brand is partly built outside-in
   through association with employees who embody brandrelevant
   characteristics in their identities and lifestyles. In return, those
   employees receive identity opportunities to validate their desired sense
   of self as `creative subject'. We discuss the dual nature of
   identity-incentive branding as neo-normative control and outline its
   implications for the organization and the employees.},

   consider the types of human resource initiatives that organizations can
   develop to cultivate employee gratitude and the contingencies of
   gratitude's emergence at the individual and organizational levels of
   analysis. Finally, we elucidate the benefits of gratitude for
   organizations and their employees. The result is a deeper understanding
   of how gratitude unfolds in organizations and the role that
   organizations themselves can play in influencing emotions at multiple

Journal = {JOURNAL OF APPLIED PSYCHOLOGY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {102},
Number = {4},
Pages = {648-657},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Low levels of employee trust in top leaders pose challenges to
   organizations with respect to retention, performance, and profits. This
   research examines how trust in top leaders can be fostered through the
   relationships individuals have with their direct leaders. We propose a
   trickle-up model whereby trust in direct leaders exerts an upward
   influence on trust in top leaders. Drawing on the group value model, we
   predict that direct leaders' procedural justice serves as the key
   mechanism in facilitating the trickle-up process. Further, this process
   should be particularly strong for employees high on vertical
   collectivism, and the trickled-up trust in top leaders should exert a
   stronger impact on employees' overall performance in the organization
   than trust in direct leaders. Multiphase and multisource data from 336
   individuals support these hypotheses. The findings advance our
   understanding of trust and leadership by highlighting that trust in
   leaders at different levels does not form independently and that trust
   in leaders trickles up across hierarchical levels.},

Abstract = {While organizations and researchers have traditionally conceptualized
   customers as consumers of their services and products, there is a
   growing recognition that organizations need to develop more
   collaborative relationships with clients. In this research, I explore
   one implication of this shift-how employees respond to client conflicts.
   In a multi-method qualitative study, I studied patient advocates,
   hospital employees who mediate conflicts between patients, families, and
   staff. I develop a process model that shows how mediators construct a
   web of discrete social interactions that, over time, enables them to
   develop an empathetic account of the conflict. They then selectively
   deploy the account to engage in sensegiving. The process model
   integrates research on emotions and sensemaking in novel ways. I
   identify how emotion work triggers emotion dynamics in interactions that
   facilitate or disrupt sensemaking and sensegiving. I show how plausible
   accounts are developed over the course of social interactions and that
   mediators pivoted from sensemaking to sensegiving when the account was
   characterized by empathy. Overall, this research shows how mediators
   actively generate, interpret, and influence their own and others'
   emotions, and that mediators' emotion work contributes to the success of
   collective sensemaking.},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {We studied an interprofessional collaboration to understand how
   professionals engaged with paradox in collective decision-making. At the
   beginning of our study, we observed vicious cycles in which conflict led
   to negative tension. Professionals were holding tightly to a particular
   pole of the paradox, and the higher-status pole was consistently
   overrepresented in collective decision-making. By the end of our study
   we observed the presence of virtuous cycles, where conflict led to more
   positive tension, and where professionals engaged in collective
   decision-making with more equal representation of conflicting
   approaches. We call this change process protecting the paradox and we
   identify three strategies that support this process: (1) promoting
   equality of both poles, (2) strengthening the weaker pole, and (3)
   looking beyond the paradox by focusing on desired outcomes. We
   contribute to the paradox literature by showing how vicious cycles can
   be shifted to virtuous cycles, how professionals and managers can work
   together to protect a paradox, and how status differences between poles
   can be redistributed.},

Title = {Past the Point of Speeding Up: The Negative Effects of Workload
   Saturation on Efficiency and Patient Severity},
Journal = {MANAGEMENT SCIENCE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {63},
Number = {4},
Pages = {1042-1062},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Service organizations face a trade-off between high utilization and
   responsiveness. High utilization can improve financial performance, but
   causes congestion, which increases throughput time. Employees may manage
   this trade-off by reducing processing times during periods of high
   workload, resulting in an inverted U-shaped relationship between
   utilization and throughput time. Using two years of inpatient data from
   203 California hospitals, we find evidence that patient length of stay
   (LOS) increases as occupancy increases, until a tipping point, after
   which patients are discharged early to alleviate congestion. More
   interestingly, we find a second tipping point-at 93\% occupancy-beyond
   which additional occupancy leads to a longer LOS. These results are
   indicative of a workload-related ``saturation effect{''} where employees
   can no longer overcome high workload by speeding up. Our data suggest
   that the saturation effect is due to an increase in the workload
   requirements of the remaining patients. Collectively, we find that the
   underlying relationship between occupancy and LOS is N-shaped.
   Consequently, managers who seek cost efficiencies via a strategy of high
   utilization in tandem with speeding up may find that their strategy
   backfires because there is a point at which employees are no longer able
   to compensate for a high workload by working harder, and throughput time
   counterproductively increases. We perform a counterfactual analysis and
   find that an alternate strategy of employing flexible labor when faced
   with high occupancy levels might be a more productive approach, and
   could save the hospitals in our sample up to \$138 million over 23
   months.},

Abstract = {By engaging with multiple narratives of a police killing involving
   questionable legal procedures, known as a police encounter in India, we
   attempt to narrate stories of what happens to those who resist
   organizational wrongdoing by displaying moral anger against unethical
   actions. The State enables police encounters to occur by arguing that
   exceptional and alternate methods are required to engage with the crisis
   of terror and crime that the nation faces. Thus, police encounters are
   executed in the name of the collective morality of the greater common
   good. Those who resist police encounters argue from the standpoint of a
   democratic morality by suggesting that the very efficacy of democratic
   institutions will be eroded if encounters are normalized. We explore
   questions of organizational ethics from a temporal perspective while
   navigating between contending moral positions regarding police
   encounters.},

Abstract = {This paper adopts a practice approach to paradox, examining the role of
   micro-practices in shaping constructions of and responses to paradox.
   Our approach is inductively motivated. During an ethnographic study of
   an organization implementing paradoxical goals we noticed a strong
   incidence of humor, joking, and laughter. Examining this practice
   closely, we realized that humor was used to surface, bring attention to,
   and make communicable experience of paradox in the moment by drawing out
   some specific contradiction in their work. Humor thus allowed actors to
   socially construct paradox, as well asin interaction with
   othersconstruct potential responses to the multiple small incidences of
   paradox in their everyday work. In doing so, humor cast the
   interactional dynamics that were integral in constructing two response
   paths: (i) entrenching a response, whereby an existing response was
   affirmed, thereby continuing on a particular response path, and (ii)
   shifting a response, whereby actors moved from one response to paradox
   to another, thereby altering how the team collectively responded to
   paradoxical issues. Drawing on these findings, we reconceptualize
   paradox as a characteristic of everyday life, which is constructed and
   responded to in the moment.},

   sector},
Journal = {ACCOUNTING ORGANIZATIONS AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {58},

Abstract = {Following the scholarly view of accounting as a social practice, this
   research explores the role of accounting in managers' ongoing efforts to
   effectively understand and influence organizational change in the course
   of a series of review meetings. To study the rote of accounting in
   meaning-making processes i.e. collective processes of ascribing meanings
   to experienced social situations - we develop a processual and semiotic
   view of Goffman's theory of frames. Central to the paper's argument is
   the concept of framing, defined as an ongoing social process of context
   production in an unfolding situation. In this perspective, accounting
   numbers are viewed as signs mediating situated interactions. This
   theoretical framework is applied to complex situations of negotiation
   between a retailer and sixteen suppliers, under a category management
   approach. The crucial finding of our research, illustrated empirically,
   is the plurality of competing frames and the occurrence of
   frame-shifting episodes, the process by which one frame is suddenly
   replaced with another frame that has a deeply different way of narrating
   the situation: this process is triggered by a specific event, and the
   frame shift has potentially significant effects on practices. The case
   study highlights the mediating role of frames, and the plasticity and
   vulnerability of framing processes. It exemplifies the dual nature of
   accounting numbers in situated meaning-making: they can be viewed
   simultaneously as generic models - parts of social frames - and singular
   events parts of the current situation. Due to this dual nature, they can
   act as mediators between a singular situation and socially-constructed,
   generic classes of meaning. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

Title = {Implicit Theories and Issue Characteristics as Determinants of Moral

Journal = {JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ETHICS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {142},
Number = {1},
Pages = {93-116},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Individuals' implicit theories that people's character is fixed (entity
   theorist) versus malleable (incremental theorist) are associated with
   their holding beliefs that morality is primarily determined by
   fulfilling prescribed duties (duty-based morality) versus upholding
   basic rights of others (rights-based morality), respectively. Three
   studies provide evidence that the ability to recognize that a situation
   can legitimately be considered from a moral point of view (moral
   awareness) is interactively dependent upon the nature of perceivers'
   implicit theories (and their associated schemas in the moral domain) and
   the extent to which the issue involves a violation that emphasizes a
   failure to fulfill a prescribed duty (duty-based violation) versus a
   failure to uphold a fundamental right of others (rights-based
   violation). The studies experimentally manipulated the characteristics
   of a hypothetical business situation to involve either a duty-based
   violation or a rights-based violation or no behavioral violation. In
   addition, Study 1 experimentally manipulated subjects' implicit
   theories, while Studies 2 and 3 measured subjects' chronically held
   implicit theories. Collectively, the studies provide consistent evidence
   that entity theorists have greater moral awareness than incremental
   theorists when considering situations involving duty-based violations,
   while incremental theorists have greater moral awareness than entity
   theorists when considering situations involving rights-based violations,
   and moral awareness is not significantly different for perceivers who
   are neither strongly entity nor incremental theorists, when considering
   situations involving duty- versus rights-based violations. Study 3 also
   found evidence of a moderated-mediated association between violation
   type and moral intentions, through moral awareness as a mediator,
   moderated by perceivers' implicit theories.},

Title = {The Decline of Social Entrenchment: Social Network Cohesion and Board
   Responsiveness to Shareholder Activism},
Journal = {ORGANIZATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {28},
Number = {2},
Pages = {262-282},

Abstract = {Shareholder activism through corporate governance proposals is a
   prominent avenue for investors to voice their concerns in corporate
   governance matters. However, shareholder proposals have an uneven effect
   on corporate governance. This paper contributes to research on
   shareholder activism by joining social movement approaches to activism
   with network theoretic approaches to corporate governance. The paper
   examines how firms' position within cohesive sections of the board
   interlock network, termed ``social entrenchment,{''}predicts (1) the
   likelihood of being targeted by activist investors and (2) firms'
   responsiveness to proposal demands. First, a firm's position in the
   board network serves as a salient network prism, attracting activists'
   attention. This is especially true for activist investors who lack other
   backchannel avenues for engagement or seek to use public reputational
   penalties as part of their activism strategy. Second, the board network
   traditionally served as an important collective infrastructure among
   managerial elites helping them preserve autonomy and power. However, the
   network has become fractured in recent years, raising questions about
   its continued role in supporting elite cohesion. Results indicate that
   prior to the mid-2000s socially entrenched firms were less responsive to
   shareholder proposals. After the mid-2000s, socially entrenched firms
   were no less responsive. Findings suggest that the board interlock
   network may have traditionally helped protect corporate elites from
   external shareholder pressures but the network may have lost its
   capacity to help corporate leaders preserve their cohesion and autonomy.},

Abstract = {Research summary: This article investigates the social context of
   entrepreneurship in organizational sectors. Prior research suggests that
   firm foundings are driven by collective patterns of activity-such as
   patterns of prior foundings in a given sector. Building on research on
   social salience and signals, we consider the influence of singular
   sector-level triggers, which we call entrepreneurial beacons. We argue
   that the actions or outcomes of single, salient organizations attract
   and motivate entrepreneurs, thus increasing the rate of foundings. We
   test this logic by examining the impact of the Yale University
   endowment's investment choices and of venture-capital- backed IPO
   run-ups on venture-capital foundings between 1984 and 2011. We find
   support for the existence and influence of beacons and outline boundary
   conditions for their effects.
   Managerial summary: What leads entrepreneurs to found new companies in
   nascent sectors? In contrast to prior research, which emphasizes
   patterns of activity, we argue that entrepreneurial activity can
   sometimes be driven by the actions of a singular trigger-what we call an
   entrepreneurial beacon. We examine the influence of two such beacons,
   Yale University's endowment investments and exceptional
   venture-capital-backed IPO run-ups, on the founding of new
   venture-capital firms over a 28-year period. We find that Yale's
   increased allocations to the venture-capital asset-class has a
   significant influence on the founding of new venture-capital firms,
   while exceptional venture-capital-backed IPO run-ups only influence
   venture-capital foundings under certain conditions. Overall, we offer an
   explanation for heretofore anecdotal accounts of certain organizations
   or events that appear to have an outsized influence on entrepreneurial
   activity. Copyright (C) 2016 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Title = {Effects of inter-group status on the pursuit of intra-group status},
Journal = {ORGANIZATIONAL BEHAVIOR AND HUMAN DECISION PROCESSES},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {139},
Pages = {1-17},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {This research examines how the status of one's group influences
   intra-group behavior and collective outcomes. Two experiments provide
   evidence that, compared to members of low-status groups, members of
   high-status groups are more concerned about their intra-group standing,
   which in turn can increase both the likelihood of competitive and
   cooperative intra-group behavior. However, whether the desire for
   intra-group standing manifests via competitive versus cooperative
   behavior depends on the relevance of the task to the group's inter-group
   standing. When the task is not clearly relevant to the group's status,
   members of high-status groups are more likely to engage in competitive
   behavior out of a desire to manage their intra-group status, which, in
   turn, leads to less desirable collective outcomes. However, when the
   group's status is at stake, members of high-status groups seek
   intra-group status via cooperative behavior, leading to better
   collective outcomes. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Auditor Choice and Its Implications for Group-Affiliated Firms},
Journal = {CONTEMPORARY ACCOUNTING RESEARCH},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {34},
Number = {1},
Pages = {39-82},
Month = {SPR},
Abstract = {We examine which of two opposing financial reporting incentives that
   group-affiliated firms experience shapes their accounting transparency
   evident in auditor choice. In one direction, complex group structure and
   intragroup transactions enable controlling shareholders to pursue
   diversionary activities that they later hide by distorting reported
   earnings. In the other direction, as outside investors price-protect
   against potential expropriation, controlling shareholders may be eager
   to improve financial reporting quality in order to alleviate agency
   costs. To empirically clarify whether group affiliation affects company
   insiders' incentives to address minority shareholders' concerns over
   agency costs, we examine auditor selection of group firms relative to
   stand-alone firms. In comparison to nongroup firms, our evidence implies
   that group firms are more likely to appoint Top 10 audit firms in China,
   especially when their controlling shareholders have stronger incentives
   to improve external monitoring of the financial reporting process. After
   isolating group firms, we find that the presence of a Top 10 auditor
   translates into higher earnings and disclosure quality, higher valuation
   implications for related-party transactions, and cheaper equity
   financing, implying that these firms benefit from engaging a
   high-quality auditor. In additional analysis consistent with our
   predictions, we find that group firms that are Top 10 clients pay higher
   audit fees and their controlling shareholders are more constrained
   against meeting earnings benchmarks through intragroup transactions and
   siphoning corporate resources at the expense of minority investors.
   Collectively, our evidence supports the narrative that insiders in firms
   belonging to business groups weigh the costs and benefits stemming from
   auditor choice.},

   CCIO/OB, major trends in research on CCIO/OB in the field in general and
   JAP in particular, and important milestones and breakthroughs achieved.

Journal = {INFORMATION SYSTEMS RESEARCH},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {28},
Number = {1},
Pages = {64-83},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Although our general knowledge about open source communities is
   extensive, we are only beginning to understand the increasingly common
   practices by which corporations design software through engagement with
   these communities. In response, we combine design theorizing with
   field-study research (1) to analyze rich qualitative data from over 40
   corporations participating in the Linux open source community and (2) to
   synthesize the observed corporate-open source community engagements into
   a new type of information systems design theory that we call responsive
   design. Empirically, we document how corporate participants in these
   contexts respond to market decisions, interdependent ideologies, and
   distributed relationships by continuously establishing and maintaining
   connections with community members; connections that stem from the
   social and material rules inherent in the open source community. Based
   on these observations, we create the theory of responsive design as a
   particular form of corporate software design which, beyond the inclusion
   of external participants, distinguishes itself from traditional
   monocentric design in which one corporation controls a dedicated team of
   software designers focused on solving an isolated and singular
   organizational problem. Guided by the principles of interconnection,
   opportunism, and domestication, we define responsive design as the kind
   of design approach that enables corporate participants to create and
   maintain productive design practices in response to the complex and
   dynamic landscapes of activities that are the foundation of
   corporate-communal engagements. We conclude with a discussion of the
   theoretical and practical implications of this new form of corporate
   software design.},

Title = {The systems psychodynamics of gendered hiring: Personal anxieties and

Abstract = {This article uses systems psychodynamic concepts to explore the creation
   and reproduction of gendered inequality within the New Zealand film
   industry. The article focuses on the ways in which senior film
   production workers' anxieties about hiring, or working with, women
   influence the process of assembling project teams. It suggests that the
   process of choosing team members creates considerable anxiety for both
   senior film production workers with responsibility for hiring and
   lower-status team members who need to rely on them to create
   high-functioning teams. The industry ideal of the autonomous creative
   worker is implicitly gendered, conforming more closely to traditional
   concepts of the unencumbered male worker than traditional ideals of
   femininity and motherhood. The antithesis between these representations
   creates anxiety, raising unconscious fears that women as a category are
   less trustworthy workers. Consequently, discriminatory hiring practices
   that diminish these anxieties become collectively accepted as rational
   responses to organizational problems and embedded within the social
   system as collectively endorsed defences against anxiety. Given that
   project-based employment is temporary, this pattern of discrimination
   against women is regularly repeated and contributes to entrenched gender
   inequality within the film industry. Qualitative data from interviews
   with 12 male and 13 female film production workers is presented to
   illustrate this analysis.},

   existence of the Journal of Applied Psychology. Along with classic
   articles from this journal, we expand our review to include other

   earliest papers examined practical methods for turnover reduction or
   control and then explain how theory development and testing began in the
   mid-20th century and dominated the academic literature until the turn of
   the century. We then track 21st century interest in the psychology of
   staying ( rather than leaving) and attitudinal trajectories in
   predicting turnover. Finally, we discuss the rising scholarship on
   collective turnover given the centrality of human capital flight to
   practitioners and to the field of human resource management strategy.},

Abstract = {Over the past 100 years, research on job attitudes has improved in the
   sophistication of methods and in the productive use of theory as a basis
   for fundamental research into questions of work psychology. Early
   research incorporated a diversity of methods for measuring potential
   predictors and outcomes of job attitudes. Over time, methods for
   statistically assessing these relationships became more rigorous, but
   the field also became narrower. In recent years, developments in theory
   and methodology have reinvigorated research, which now addresses a rich
   panoply of topics related to the daily flow of affect, the complexity of
   personal motives and dispositions, and the complex interplay of attitude
   objects and motivation in shaping behavior. Despite these apparent
   changes, a review of the concepts and substantive arguments that
   underpin this literature have remained remarkably consistent. We
   conclude by discussing how we expect that these major themes will be
   addressed in the future, emphasizing topics that have proven to be
   enduring guides for understanding the ways that people construe and
   react to their appraisals of their work.},

Abstract = {In the last decade, interest in the ``wisdom of crowds{''} effect has
   gained momentum in both organizational research and corporate practice.
   Crowd wisdom relies on the aggregation of independent judgments. The
   accuracy of a group's aggregate prediction rises with the number,
   ability, and diversity of its members. We investigate these variables'
   relative importance for collective prediction using agent-based
   simulation. We replicate the ``diversity trumps ability{''} proposition
   for large groups, showing that samples of heterogeneous agents
   outperform same-sized homogeneous teams of high ability. In groups
   smaller than approximately 16 members, however, the effects of group
   composition depend on the social decision function employed: diversity
   is key only in continuous estimation tasks (averaging) and much less
   important in discrete choice tasks (voting), in which agents' individual
   abilities remain crucial. Thus, strategies to improve collective
   decision making must adapt to the predictive situation at hand.},

Abstract = {Using a survey of tax executives from multinational corporations, we
   document that some firms set their transfer pricing strategy to minimize
   tax payments, but more firms focus on tax compliance. We estimate that a
   firm focusing on minimizing taxes has a GAAP effective tax rate that is
   6.6 percentage points lower and generates about \$43 million more in tax
   savings, on average, than a firm focusing on tax compliance. Available
   COMPUSTAT data on sample firms confirm our survey-based inferences. We
   also find that transfer pricing-related tax savings are greater when
   higher foreign income, tax haven use, and R\&D activities are combined
   with a tax minimization strategy. Finally, compliance-focused firms
   report lower FIN 48 tax reserves than tax-minimizing firms, consistent
   with the former group using less uncertain transfer pricing
   arrangements. Collectively, our study provides direct evidence that
   multinational firms have differing internal priorities for transfer
   pricing, and that these differences are strongly related to the taxes
   reported by these firms.},

Abstract = {Research summary: Competitors' experiences of prior interactions shape
   patterns of rivalry over time. However, mechanisms that influence
   learning from competitive experience remain largely unexamined. We
   develop a computational model of dyadic rivalry to examine how time
   delays in competitors' feedback influence their learning. Time delays
   are inevitable because the process of executing competitive moves takes
   time, and the market's responses unfold gradually. We analyze how these
   lags impact learning and, subsequently, firms' competitive behavior,
   industry profits, and performance heterogeneity. In line with the extant
   learning literature, our findings reveal that time delays hinder
   learning from experience. However, this counterintuitively increases
   rivals' profits by reducing their investments in costly head-to-head
   competition. Time delays also engender performance heterogeneity by
   causing rivals' paths of competitive behavior to diverge.
   Managerial summary: While competitive actions such as new product
   launches, geographical expansion, and marketing campaigns require
   up-front resource commitments, the potential lift in profits takes time
   to materialize. This time delay, combined with uncertainty surrounding
   the outcomes of competitive actions, makes it difficult for managers to
   learn reliably from previous investment decisions. This results in
   systematic underinvestment in competitive actions. The severity of the
   underinvestment grows as the time delay between an investment and its
   positive results increases. Counterintuitively, however, competitors'
   collective underinvestment increases profit-making opportunities. In
   industries with large time delays, companies that do invest in
   competitive actions are likely to enjoy high returns on investment. It
   is also likely that rivals' paths of competitive behavior bifurcate.
   Together, these mechanisms generate large differences in competitors'
   profits. Copyright (C) 2016 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Abstract = {This study examines how authentic leadership influences team performance
   via the mediating mechanism of team reflexivity. Adopting a
   self-regulatory perspective, we propose that authentic leadership will
   predict the specific team regulatory process of reflexivity, which in
   turn will be associated with two outcomes of team performance,
   effectiveness and productivity. Using survey data from 53 teams in three
   organizations in the United Kingdom and Greece and controlling for
   collective trust, we found support for our stated hypotheses with the
   results indicating a significant fully mediated relationship. As
   predicted the self-regulatory behaviors inherent in the process of
   authentic leadership served to collectively shape team behavior,
   manifesting in the process of team reflexivity, which, in turn,
   positively predicted team performance. We conclude with a discussion of
   how this study extends theoretical understanding of authentic leadership
   in relation to teamwork and delineate several practical implications for
   leaders and organizations.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF ACCOUNTING RESEARCH},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {55},
Number = {1},
Pages = {197-233},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Using a data set that records banks' ongoing requests of information
   from small commercial borrowers, we examine when banks use financial
   statements to monitor borrowers after loan origination. We find that
   banks request financial statements for half the loans and this variation
   is related to borrower credit risk, relationship length, collateral, and
   the provision of business tax returns, but in complex ways. The relation
   between borrower risk and financial statement requests has an inverted
   U-shape; and tax returns can be both substitutes and complements to
   financial statements, conditional on borrower characteristics and the

   Collectively, our results provide novel evidence of a fundamental

   commercial borrowers and a specific channel through which banks fulfill
   their role as delegated monitors.},

Journal = {ADMINISTRATIVE SCIENCE QUARTERLY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {62},
Number = {1},
Pages = {140-178},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Salient successes and failures, such as spectacular venture capital
   investments or agonizing bankruptcies, affect collective beliefs about
   the viability of particular markets. Using data on software start-ups
   from 1990 to 2002, we show that collective sense-making in the wake of
   such vital events can result in consensus behavior among entrepreneurs.
   Market search is a critical part of the entrepreneurial process, as
   entrepreneurs frequently enter new markets to find high-growth areas.
   When spectacular financings result in a collective overstatement of the
   attractiveness of a market, a consensus emerges that the market is
   resource-rich, and the path is cleared for many entries, including those
   that do not have a clear fit. When notorious failures render a market
   unpopular, only the most viable entrants will overcome exaggerated
   skepticism and enter, taking the non-consensus route. Venture
   capitalists likewise exhibit herding behavior, following other VCs into
   hot markets. We theorize that vital events effectively change the
   selection threshold for market entries, which changes the average
   viability of new entrants. We find that consensus entrants are less
   viable, while non-consensus entrants are more likely to prosper.
   Non-consensus entrepreneurs who buck the trends are most likely to stay
   in the market, receive funding, and ultimately go public.},

Abstract = {Organizations have to cope with the complexity of their environment in
   order to survive. A considerable body of research has shown that
   organizations may respond to environmental complexity by creating
   internal complexity - for example, by expanding internal structures and
   processes. However, researchers know less about how organizations create
   collaborative complexity collectively - for example, by establishing
   alliances or developing common standards. This paper uses social systems
   theory to explore how organizations collaborate in response to
   complexity and to analyse the conditions under which they create either
   internal or collaborative complexity (or both) to address environmental
   complexity. Italso examines how these types of complexity feed back into
   environmental complexity. Toillustrate our conceptual model, we use
   corporate social responsibility (CSR).},

Year = {2017},
Volume = {62},

Abstract = {I examine how different distributions of ownership and governance rights
   in firms affect the optimal organization of cross-functional project
   teams for knowledge-intensive work. I analyze multi-method data from two
   competing automated manufacturing equipment engineering firms with
   contrasting formal power structures, one a worker cooperative with
   ownership and governance rights distributed across occupations and the
   other a conventional firm with ownership and governance rights
   concentrated in the hands of several senior workers in one occupational
   group. Contrary to prior research, my findings suggest that when
   collective tasks are uncertain and complex, the benefits of
   cross-functional interactions depend on organizations' formal power
   structure: cross-functional interactions improve teams' productivity in
   the context of concentrated ownership and governance rights but not when
   ownership and governance rights are widely distributed among workers.
   Fieldwork at the two firms revealed three mechanisms by which dispersed
   formal power decreases the productivity benefits of cross-functional
   interaction: it reduces status distinctions among team members,
   increasing the labor hours required to resolve conflicts; boosts
   participation in oversight and coordination processes outside teams so
   that workers have more access to information and less need for
   cross-functional interactions; and increases the distribution of
   knowledge-management technology, which increases workers' autonomy and
   reduces the value of cross-functional interactions.},

Abstract = {Many scholars argue that workforce unionization leads to a reduction in
   R\&D investment because unions appropriate a share of the returns to
   successful inventive efforts. On the other hand, it is widely
   acknowledged that unions may encourage investment in R\&D because of
   increased cooperation between workers and management. Our empirical
   analysis on cross-country firm-level data from 23 emerging and
   developing countries reveals a negative association between workforce
   unionization and firms' R\&D investment. This association is
   particularly pronounced when unions are protected by strong collective
   relations laws, supporting the notion that strong unions `tax' the
   returns to successful inventions. Our findings have implications for
   policy makers who seek to improve emerging countries' chances of
   catching up to the technological frontier, and for firm leaders
   concerned about the appropriation of returns to their R\&D investments.

Abstract = {This paper explores the dynamics of inter-sectoral technological

   pervasive technologies, whose collective broad applicability may enhance
   the connection between `distant' knowledge by offering a technological
   coupling. Using data on patents obtained from the CRIOS-PATSTAT database
   for four EU countries (Germany, UK, France and Italy), we provide
   empirical evidence that bridging platforms are likely to connect more
   effectively innovations across distant technological domains, fostering
   inter-sectoral technological integration and the development of original
   innovation. Public research organisations are also found to play a
   crucial role in terms of technological integration and original
   innovation due to their higher capacity to access and use bridging
   platforms within their innovation activities. (C) 2016 The Author(s).

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {We demonstrate that a sampling-based mechanism can offer an alternative
   explanation for belief synchronization in social groups and the
   persistence of collective illusions. Our model assumes that people are
   more likely to sample popular alternatives than unpopular alternatives.
   We show that this mechanism is sufficient to explain belief
   synchronization: a strong majority of opinions will likely emerge in
   favor of one alternative. The reason is that the group is unlikely to
   move away from a state in which one alternative is very unpopular. If by
   chance most people come to dislike alternative A, they are all unlikely
   to sample it again and their opinions of A remain the same. When A is in
   fact the best alternative, a collective illusion has emerged because
   people mistakenly believe that a suboptimal alternative is the best. Our
   model implies that such a collective illusion is persistent. The model
   thus offers an existence proof that a collective illusion can occur even
   in settings where people do not infer that popular alternatives are
   better. The model also casts new light on the effect of online
   recommendation systems on attitude homogenization and the effect of
   majority voting on beliefs and attitudes.},

   free-riding-defined as their effort-withholding-and their perceptions of
   alliance effectiveness and peers' collaboration. Specifically, we posit
   a U-shaped relationship between partners' subjective evaluations of
   alliance effectiveness and their free-riding. We also hypothesize a
   negative relation between partners' perceptions of the collaboration of
   peer organizations and their free-riding. Results from a mixed-method
   study-combining regression analysis of primary data on a major
   inter-organizational research consortium and evidence from two
   experimental designs-support our hypotheses, bearing implications for
   the multi-party alliances literature.
   Managerial summary: Free-riding is a major concern in multi-party
   alliances such as large research consortia, since the performance of
   these governance forms hinges on the joint contribution of multiple
   partners that often operate according to different logics (e.g.,
   universities, firms, and government agencies). We show that, in such
   alliances, partners' perceptions have relevant implications for their
   willingness to contribute to the consortium's shared goals.
   Specifically, we find that partners free-ride more-that is, contribute
   less-when they perceive the effectiveness of the overall alliance to be
   either very low or very high. Partners also gauge their commitment to
   the alliance on the perception of the effort of their peers-that is,
   other organizations similar to them. These findings provide managers of
   multi-party alliances with additional levers to motivate partners to
   contribute fairly to such joint endeavor. Copyright (C) 2015 John Wiley

Year = {2017},
Volume = {43},
Number = {5},
Pages = {659-682},

Abstract = {How is consumer desire transformed by contemporary technology? Most
   extant theory holds that technology rationalizes and reduces passion. In
   our investigation of networks of desire-complex open systems of
   machines, consumers, energy, and objects-we find technology increasing
   the passion to consume. Effects depend upon participation in the
   network, which can be private, public, or professional. Private
   participation tends to discipline passion into interests reflecting
   established cultural categories. Public and professional participation
   build new connections between extant desires and a wider network,
   decentering ties and deterritorializing flows that limit hungers to
   emplaced bodies. Public and professional participation drive consumption
   passion to transgressive extremes. We use ethnography and netnography to
   study online food image sharing, a broad field that includes everything
   from friend networks to food bloggers. Using and extending Deleuze and
   Guattari's desire theory, we conceptualize desire as energetic,
   connective, systemic, and innovative. Critically examining the role of
   technocapitalism in the realm of consumption passion, we question the
   emancipatory possibilities of unfettered desire. Networks of desire
   create a passionate new universe of technologically enhanced desire, one
   that challenges the way we think about consumer collectives, capitalism,
   emancipation, and posthuman consumption.},

Journal = {RESEARCH POLICY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {46},
Number = {1},
Pages = {207-218},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {This paper develops a renewed research impact assessment approach that
   goes beyond the traditional computation of internal rates of returns but
   allows collective learning, understanding and guiding systems
   transformation. Our approach (ASIRPA) builds on the broader research
   impact assessment literature which discusses impact-generating
   mechanisms in nonlinear dynamic processes. The main originality of
   ASIRPA is that it is based on a theory of innovation inspired by Actor
   Network Theory and a standardized ex-post case study methodology.
   Standardized case studies allow systematic codification of the variables
   for each case study, and the building of four ideal-type impact
   pathways. Each of these ideal-types is characterized by specific
   translation mechanisms, critical points, research and adoption networks,
   research outputs, and impacts. Our analytical framework and empirical
   analysis provide new insights into the contribution of an agricultural
   Public Research Organization to impact generation, and the role of users
   and networks in impact pathways. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {Making norms to tackle global challenges: The role of Intergovernmental
   Organisations},
Journal = {RESEARCH POLICY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {46},
Number = {1},
Pages = {171-181},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {This paper argues that Intergovernmental Organisations (IGOs) can play a
   significant role in the processes of system transformation required by
   Grand Challenges. The reason is their potential to influence
   socio-technical regimes connected to policy areas in which they have
   authority. Supported by mandates, moral standing and technical
   expertise, IGOs act in two ways: operating with high level of political
   support, these organisations guide priority setting and norm development
   through the definition of collective problems and solutions, including
   STI aspects, establishing a shared vision; involving public and private
   actors, IGOs implement and protect novel practices that reinforce the
   new norms, from legally binding agreements to the creation of new spaces
   for international collaboration. These processes are examined here in
   the field of global health, where outside pressure directed at the
   intellectual property rules in connection to access to medicines
   prompted the WHO to define the health challenge as a need to stimulate
   innovation and ensure wide access to technology at the same time. Two of
   the solutions implemented by IGOs to achieve both goals are analysed:
   the Medicines Patent Pool, designed by UNITAID to fulfil access and
   innovation needs in relation to HIV/AIDS drugs, and WIPO Re;Search, set
   up by WIPO to support collaboration and accelerate discovery and product
   development for Neglected Tropical Diseases, Malaria and Tuberculosis.

Title = {RESOURCE AMBIDEXTERITY THROUGH ALLIANCE PORTFOLIOS AND FIRM PERFORMANCE},
Journal = {STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT JOURNAL},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {38},
Number = {2},
Pages = {384-394},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Research summary: Partner resources can be an important alternative to
   internal firm resources for attaining dual and seemingly incompatible
   strategic objectives. We extend arguments about managing conflicting
   objectives typically made at the firm level to the level of a firm's
   alliance portfolio. Specifically, will a balance between revenue
   enhancement and cost reduction attained collectively through partner
   resources accessed via a firm's various alliances be similarly
   beneficial for firm performance? Additionally, how do strategic
   attributes of alliance portfolio configuration, specifically alliance
   portfolio size and partner resource scope, condition the
   balance-performance relationship? Based on data from the global airline
   industry, we find support for the balance-performance relationship,
   though such balance is less beneficial for firms in the case of access
   to a broader resource scope per partner.
   Managerial summary: Increasing revenue and reducing costs simultaneously
   can potentially enhance firm competitiveness. We highlight that an
   alliance strategy can be an important alternative to internal resources
   for attaining such dual strategic objectives, particularly when partner
   resources accessed through alliances are treated collectively as
   portfolios. We examine the importance of balancing product-market
   extending and efficiency-improving partner resources in the global
   airline industry as well as the impact of two alternate strategies for
   accessing resources through alliances: fewer partners with more
   resources per partner or more partners with fewer resources per partner.
   We find that resource balance at the portfolio level helps airlines
   improve performance. Our results also suggest that managers should be
   cautious of accessing too many resources through just a few partners.

Year = {2017},
Volume = {60},
Number = {1},

Month = {FEB 1},
Abstract = {Specialization within professions creates challenges for maintaining the
   macro-level values of the profession in the everyday work of specialists
   at the micro level inside organizations. By conducting a qualitative
   study of emergency-department physicians and their interactions with
   other hospital specialists, we show how specialists maintain
   professional values through two distinct processes of institutional work
   in which moral emotions-that is, emotions linked to the interests of
   others-play a key role. The first process is activated when a perceived
   episodic problem, which arises from value conflicts in interactions
   between different specialists, elicits transitory moral emotions that
   motivate institutional maintenance work through individual action. The
   second process is activated when a perceived systemic problem, which
   arises from conflict between professional values writ large and
   organizational practices, elicits moral emotions that are enduring and
   shared across specialists. These emotions mobilize collective action in
   institutional maintenance work that changes the organizational practice.
   By focusing on values as a source of conflict and a motive for
   professional action inside organizations, our model contributes a
   nuanced understanding to the everyday work of professionals and
   specialists and draws attention to emotion elicitors and emotional scope
   as affective mechanisms in processes of institutional work.},

Title = {An ounce of prevention or a pound of cure? Two experiments on in-process
   interventions in decision-making groups},
Journal = {ORGANIZATIONAL BEHAVIOR AND HUMAN DECISION PROCESSES},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {138},
Pages = {59-73},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {This paper details two laboratory experiments about the timing of formal
   interventions in decision making groups. Study 1 showed that groups
   receiving in-process interventions pooled more critical information and
   made better decisions than groups receiving pre-task interventions
   because in-process interventions prolonged discussions and reduced
   discussion of member preferences. Study 2 showed a similar pattern of
   results over a smaller time frame; groups receiving in-process
   interventions prolonged their discussions, discussed member preferences
   less, and pooled more critical information than those receiving pre-task
   interventions because they perceived those interventions as more
   valuable, which indirectly improved the quality of their decisions.
   Surprisingly, the specific timing of in-process interventions had no
   significant effects on information pooling or group decisions in either
   study. These studies collectively suggest that decision-making groups
   respond more strongly to interventions designed to cure process
   problems, rather than prevent them, which has implications for theory on
   formal interventions, group decision making, and group development. (C)

Abstract = {Increasing attention is being paid to the impacts of country-level
   contexts on the work-life interface. However, lack of theoretical
   clarity as well as operationalization challenges are significant
   roadblocks for comparative work-life research. This article provides
   guidance for cross-national work-life research by conducting a
   systematic interdisciplinary review of conceptual and empirical work on
   the country-level cultural impacts (i.e., the values, assumptions, and
   beliefs shared by individuals with common historical experience) and
   structural impacts (i.e., the rules and constraints produced by legal,
   economic, and social structures) on individual experiences of the
   work-life interface and organizational support for nonwork. Regarding
   culture, we offer an organized review of work-life research drawing on
   cultural dimensions, from the most researched dimensions, such as
   individualism-collectivism and gender egalitarianism, to the least
   researched. We also point to ways to locate scales and country scores.
   Concerning structure, we explain how legal (e.g., public policies),
   economic (e.g., industrialization), and social (e.g., actual gender
   equality) factors are operationalized with indicators or typologies and
   review the related work-life research. We carve out a research agenda
   pointing out untapped cultural dimensions and structural factors and
   underresearched work-life constructs and calling for more systemic and
   integrative cross-national work-life research.},

Title = {Rethinking Collective Action: The Co-Evolution of the State and
   Institutional Entrepreneurs in Emerging Economies},
Journal = {ORGANIZATION STUDIES},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {38},
Number = {1},
Pages = {31-52},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Why do groups form to influence policy outcomes? Classic notions of
   collective action tell us that a small number of homogeneous individuals
   are more likely to organize and thus achieve their preferred policy
   outcomes. Yet, this is not always reflected in the empirical record as
   external factors, such as the state, influence the costs of organizing.
   Instead, the traditional collective action literature largely assumes a
   purely rational or passive state. While the institutional
   entrepreneurship literature highlights the key role these actors can
   play in shaping institutions and, at times, organizational fields, it
   does not seek to explain why change agents appear in some instances and
   not others. This article seeks to fill this theoretical gap by drawing
   on the co-evolution literature, which helps explain the variation in
   group formation by underscoring how the state and institutional
   entrepreneurs shape one another. Utilizing rich qualitative data from
   the microfinance industry in Brazil and Mexico, this research asserts
   that the formation of microfinance associations is a function of actors'
   ability to access the state, which results in distinct processes:
   co-evolution by isolation or co-optation. This process has subsequent
   implications for institutional change, policy outcomes, and, ultimately,
   the distribution of power and prospects of development within emerging
   economies.},

Abstract = {This study examines the impact of corporate site visits on analysts'
   forecast accuracy based on a sample of such visits to Chinese listed
   firms during 2009-2012. We find that analysts who conduct visits
   ({''}visiting analysts{''}) have a greater increase in forecast accuracy
   than other analysts. Consistent with the notion that site visits
   facilitate analysts' information acquisition through observing firms'
   operations, we find that the results are stronger for manufacturing
   firms, firms with more tangible assets, and firms with more concentrated
   business lines. Moreover, we find that the effect of a site visit is
   greater when the site visit is an analyst-only visit, when the current
   visit is preceded by fewer visits, and when visiting analysts are based
   far from the visited firms. Furthermore, we find that site visits
   partially mitigate nonlocal analysts' information disadvantage.
   Collectively, these results indicate that site visits are an important
   information acquisition activity for analysts.},

Abstract = {Recent research suggests that collectivism breeds corruption in bank
   lending. This finding, together with the stickiness of culture, poses a
   direct challenge to economic growth in collectivist societies. In this
   paper, we address this grim outlook by examining the types of firms that
   are susceptible to the detrimental effect of collectivism on lending
   integrity and the formal institutions that can help alleviate such
   effect. We find that the adverse effect of collectivism on bank
   corruption is more severe in small and medium-sized firms, privately
   owned firms, and non-exporting firms, while it is considerably weaker in
   countries with more effective private monitoring, a higher (lower)
   fraction of foreign-owned (government-owned) banks, a more competitive
   banking sector, better information sharing, and stronger legal and
   political institutions. Our findings are robust to using alternative
   measures of collectivism and alternative dependent variables. These
   results highlight how firm-level characteristics and formal institutions
   interact with collectivism in affecting firms' access to bank credit.},

   the underlying source of such value is the collective flow of knowledge
   among community participants. We distinguish the conditions for flows of

   unconventional theoretical conjecture: Online communities give rise to
   tacit knowledge flows between participants. The crucial condition for
   these flows is not the advent of novel, digital technology as often
   portrayed in the literature, but instead the technology's domestication
   by humanity and the sociality it affords. This conjecture holds profound
   implications for theory and research in the study of management and

Journal = {JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {43},
Number = {4},
Pages = {509-533},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Extant research tends to adopt a community perspective when examining
   value creation in consumer collectives that limits the understanding of
   how value is created in loosely organized, dynamic, and heterogeneous
   networks. This study expands research on value creation by adopting a
   circulation-centric perspective that explains how value is created
   systemically in collaborative consumer networks. Inspired by
   anthropological theories of value creation, this study examines how
   circulation enables the systemic creation of value by connecting
   networked participants, their actions, objects, and value outcomes.
   Ethnographic and netnographic data were collected on the collaborative
   network of geocaching, in which consumers promote the circulation of
   objects known as travel bugs. The systemic creation of value in
   collaborative consumer networks is composed of four subprocesses
   triggered by object circulation-enactment, transvaluation, assessment,
   and alignment-that may happen concurrently and in multiple iterations.
   This process explains how geographic dispersion can coexist with the
   cultural situatedness of value creation and helps integrate prior
   research on value creation and value outcomes through the development of
   a systemic framework that explains value creation in terms of both
   individual actions and collective outcomes. Moreover, the findings
   motivate discussion on the affordances of physical and digital objects
   for value creation.},

Abstract = {Issues relating to litigation and other forms of employee legal claiming
   are at the forefront of the practice of human resource management.
   However, organizational scholars have paid scant attention to this
   important aspect of organizational life. Underrepresented in this
   collective research have been investigations into how social influence
   variables impact the legal claiming process. We add to the understanding
   of legal claiming by evaluating how perceived levels of accountability,
   reputation and political skill affect individuals' willingness to engage
   in contentious and non-contentious legal claiming. We also investigate
   the impact that social influence has on individuals' advice to other
   potential claimants. This study employed a longitudinal design utilizing
   both scenarios and survey data collection. Results from our study
   partially support the conclusion that individuals are more risk-averse
   in their own legal claiming considerations than they are in the advice
   they offer to similarly-situated others. Furthermore, accountability,
   reputation and interpersonal influence (one aspect of political skill)
   were found to significantly influence the likelihood of legal claiming.
   The pattern of results indicates that social influence variables play a
   role in determining whether legal claiming will be pursued and what type
   of claiming will be chosen.},

Abstract = {This paper aims to examine the impact of national cultural values on the
   relation between auditing and reporting standards and ethical behaviours
   of firms. Based on a regression analysis using data regarding 54
   countries between the years 2007 and 2012, we found that the impact of
   the perceived strength of auditing and reporting standards on the
   perceived ethical behaviours of firms is accentuated when a society is
   characterized by low power distance and in-group collectivism, and high
   institutional collectivism, future orientation and uncertainty
   avoidance. Empirically, the study addresses a gap in the literature by
   highlighting the influence of national culture on the effectiveness of
   legal settings and regulations on ethical behaviours.},

Journal = {HUMAN RELATIONS},

Volume = {69},
Number = {11},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Giving the crucial role of organizational context in shaping individual
   attitudes and behaviors at work, in this research we studied the effects
   of collective work-unit perceptions of social context on individual work
   resilience and two key individual outcomes: job satisfaction and job
   performance as rated by the supervisor. We theorized that collective
   perceptions of social context act as antecedents of individual
   variables, and that individual job satisfaction mediates the
   relationship between collective perceptions of social context and job
   performance, and between work resilience and job performance over time.
   A sample of 305 white-collar employees, clustered in 67 work-units,
   participated in the study. Hierarchical linear modeling highlighted that
   collective perceptions of social context are significant related to
   individual work resilience. Moreover, results showed that individual job
   satisfaction fully mediates the relationship between collective
   perceptions of social context and individual job performance and the
   relationship between individual work resilience and individual job
   performance. At a practical level, results suggest that interventions on
   collective perceptions of social context may increase work resilience,
   job satisfaction and job performance over time at the individual level.},

Abstract = {This paper focuses on revealed preference tests of the collective model
   of household consumption. We start by showing that the decision problems
   corresponding to testing collective rationality are NP-complete. This
   makes the application of these tests problematic for (increasingly
   available) large(r)-scale data sets. We then present two approaches to
   overcome this negative result. First, we introduce exact algorithms
   based on mixed-integer programming (MIP) formulations of the collective
   rationality tests, which can be usefully applied to medium-sized data
   sets. Next, we propose simulated annealing heuristics, which allow for
   efficient testing of the collective model in the case of large data
   sets. We illustrate our methods by a number of computational experiments
   based on Dutch labor supply data.},

Abstract = {Organization theorists have predominantly studied identity and
   organizing within the managed work organization. This frames
   organization as a structure within which identity work occurs, often as
   a means of managerial control. In our paper our contribution is to
   develop the concept of individuation pursued through prefigurative
   practices within alternative organizing to reframe this relation. We
   combine recent scholarship on alternative organizations and new social
   movements to provide a theoretical grounding for an ethnographic study
   of the prefigurative organizing practices and related identity work of
   an alternative group in a UK city. We argue that in such groups,
   identity, organizing and politics become a purposeful set of integrated
   processes aimed at the creation of new forms of life in the here and
   now, thus organizing is politics is identity. Our study presents a
   number of challenges and possibilities to scholars of organization,
   enabling them to extend their understanding of organization and identity
   in the contemporary world.},

Abstract = {This article presents the results of a cross-cultural study that
   examines the relationship between spirituality and a consumer's ethical
   predisposition, and further examines the relationship between the
   internalization of one's moral identity and a consumer's ethical
   predisposition. Finally, the moderating impact of cultural factors on
   the above relationships is tested using Hofstede's five dimensions. Data
   were gathered from young adult, well-educated consumers in five
   different countries, namely the U.S., France, Spain, India, and Egypt.
   The results indicate that the more spiritual an individual consumer is,
   the more likely that consumer is to be ethically predisposed.
   Furthermore, the stronger one's internalization of a moral identity, the
   more likely one is to be ethically predisposed. These two relationships
   are further moderated by Hofstede's cultural factors such as the degree
   of collectivism versus individualism in the culture. However, the
   strength and direction of the moderation may vary depending upon the
   specific Hofstede dimension.},

Abstract = {This study explored how managers' fairness perceptions of performance
   evaluation systems differ across countries and relate to their job
   satisfaction. Lack-of-group bias and transparency were the constructs
   used to assess fairness perceptions. The data sample consisted of 903
   Asian managers from the subsidiaries of a leading multinational
   corporation (MNC) strategically expanding its retail markets in Japan,
   China, Hong Kong, Malaysia, and Thailand. Results showed that the
   fairness perceptions of lack-of-group bias and transparency concerning
   the common performance evaluation system varied within these Asian
   countries. Furthermore, those fairness perceptions were significantly
   related to job satisfaction among Asian managers overall, as well as in
   each of the five geographical subgroups with the exception of Hong Kong,
   where the perception of a lack-of-group bias was only marginally related
   to job satisfaction. These findings offer theoretical implications
   regarding organizational justice, cross-national management, and
   performance evaluation, as well as practical implications for leveraging
   organizational justice perceptions of performance evaluation systems for
   the effectiveness of MNCs. (c) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

Journal = {ORGANIZATIONAL BEHAVIOR AND HUMAN DECISION PROCESSES},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {137},
Pages = {207-217},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Emotions influence ethical behavior. Across four studies, we demonstrate
   that incidental anger, anger triggered by an unrelated situation,
   promotes the use of deception. In Study 1, participants who felt
   incidental anger were more likely to deceive their counterpart than
   those who felt neutral emotion. In Study 2, we demonstrate that empathy
   mediates the relationship between anger and deception. In Study 3, we
   contrast anger with another negative-valence emotion, sadness. We find
   that participants who felt incidental anger were more likely to use
   deception than were participants who felt incidental sadness or neutral
   emotion. In Study 4, we show that incentives moderate the relationship
   between anger and deception. Collectively, our work reveals that
   incidental anger promotes unethical behavior because angry people become
   less empathetic when pursuing their self-interest. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Abstract = {The existing analysis of heterogeneous social responsibility (SR) in
   small and medium enterprises (SMEs) has considered the effects of
   individual factors. However, no holistic analysis has been performed on
   how different factors of heterogeneity interact and how they
   collectively affect SR in SMEs. Here, we propose a new systemic
   approach-employing the social capital concept-with the aim of
   identifying how and why SR is built diversely in SMEs. In particular, we
   focus on a positive and holistic perspective that integrates the factors
   proposed in the literature into the social capital construct. Through a
   case study of four Spanish SMEs, this article proposes a systemic
   approach to the study of heterogeneous SR in SMEs.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF CONSUMER PSYCHOLOGY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {26},
Number = {4},
Pages = {510-523},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {We investigate the impact of self-construal on extreme responding in six
   studies. The results show that people with an independent self-construal
   generally answer more extremely to survey items than those with an
   interdependent self-construal, especially when the items are self
   relevant (Studies la and 1b) and when these items are fluently processed
   (Study 3). Using an experimental causal chain design, this research also
   demonstrates that self-concept clarity drives the effect of
   self-construal on extreme responding. In particular, people with an
   independent self-construal have a higher level of self-concept clarity
   (Study 2a), and self-clarity leads to an extreme response style (Study
   2b). In Study 4, we demonstrate that the difference in extreme
   responding can partly explain a well-established self-construal effect,
   and we offer a solution to control for the bias in extreme responding in
   self-construal research. (C) 2016 Society for Consumer Psychology.

Title = {Hedonic Escalation: When Food Just Tastes Better and Better},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {43},
Number = {3},
Pages = {388-406},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Hedonic escalation is the increased liking of each additional bite of a
   palatable food. Hedonic escalation is more likely to occur when (1) a
   palatable food consists of a complex combination of flavors, and (2) a
   person is motivated to taste additional flavors on each successive bite.
   Consequently, hedonic escalation is more prevalent when people can
   identify more flavors (pilot study), attend to additional flavors on
   each taste trial (study 1), have an opportunity to identify an
   additional flavor on each taste trial (study 2), and isolate distinct
   flavors on each taste trial (study 3). Changes in hedonic escalation can
   be attributed to increased sensitization to flavors as opposed to
   changes in the rate of habituation (study 4). Hedonic escalation can
   also increase consumption (study 5) and influence food choices (study
   6). Collectively, these studies show that hedonic escalation is enabled
   by the opportunity to identify an additional source of hedonic
   experience on each successive taste of a food.},

Abstract = {As a synthesis of organization theory and historiography, the field of
   organizational history is mature enough to contribute to wider
   theoretical and historiographical debates and is sufficiently developed
   for a theoretical consideration of its subject matter. In this
   introduction to the Special Topic Forum on History and Organization
   Studies, we take up the question, ``What is organizational history?{''}
   and consider three distinct arguments that we believe frame the next
   phase of development for historical work within organization studies.
   First, we argue that following the ``historic turn,{''} organizational
   history has developed as a subfield of organization studies that takes
   seriously the matter of history, promoting historical research as a way
   to enrich the broad endeavor of organization. Second, if ``history
   matters,{''} then organization theory needs a theoretical account of the
   past that goes beyond the mere use of history as a context to test or as
   cm example to illustrate theory. Third, the focus on ``history that
   matters{''} in the present leads to two important considerations: how
   organizations can use ``rhetorical history{''} as a strategic resource
   and the need to engage with historiographically significant subjects
   that connect organization theory to larger humanistic concerns, such as
   slavery and racism.},

Title = {The Dynamics of Team Cognition: A Process-Oriented Theory of Knowledge
   Emergence in Teams},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF APPLIED PSYCHOLOGY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {101},
Number = {10},
Pages = {1353-1385},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Team cognition has been identified as a critical component of team
   performance and decision-making. However, theory and research in this
   domain continues to remain largely static; articulation and examination
   of the dynamic processes through which collectively held knowledge
   emerges from the individual-to the team-level is lacking. To address
   this gap, we advance and systematically evaluate a process-oriented
   theory of team knowledge emergence. First, we summarize the core
   concepts and dynamic mechanisms that underlie team knowledge-building
   and represent our theory of team knowledge emergence (Step 1). We then
   translate this narrative theory into a formal computational model that
   provides an explicit specification of how these core concepts and
   mechanisms interact to produce emergent team knowledge (Step 2). The
   computational model is next instantiated into an agent-based simulation
   to explore how the key generative process mechanisms described in our
   theory contribute to improved knowledge emergence in teams (Step 3).
   Results from the simulations demonstrate that agent teams generate
   collectively shared knowledge more effectively when members are capable
   of processing information more efficiently and when teams follow
   communication strategies that promote equal rates of information sharing
   across members. Lastly, we conduct an empirical experiment with real
   teams participating in a collective knowledge-building task to verify
   that promoting these processes in human teams also leads to improved
   team knowledge emergence (Step 4). Discussion focuses on implications of
   the theory for examining team cognition processes and dynamics as well
   as directions for future research. This document is copyrighted by the

Volume = {41},
Number = {4},

Abstract = {We draw on the historiographical concepts of ``generational units{''}
   and ``collective memories{''} as a framework for understanding the
   emergence of entrepreneurially oriented cohesive groups within regions.
   Generational units are localized subgroups within generations that have
   a self-referential, reflexive quality by virtue of the members' sense of
   their own connections to each other and the events that define them.
   Collective memories ``are shared accounts of the past shaped by
   historical events that mold individuals' perceptions. The two concepts
   provide a valuable point of ``departure for incorporating historical
   concepts into the study of entrepreneurial dynamics and offer a
   framework for understanding how entrepreneurs' historically situated
   experiences affect them. Our framework breaks new theoretical ground in
   several ways. First, we synthesize disparate bodies of literature on
   generational units, collective memory, and organizational imprinting.
   Second, we specify mechanisms through which imprinting occurs and
   persists over time. We develop analytical arguments framed by
   sociological and historiographical theories, focusing on the conditions
   under which meaningful generational units of entrepreneurs may emerge
   and benefit from leadership and legacy building, technologies of memory,
   and institutional support that increases the likelihood of their
   persistence.},

Journal = {ACADEMY OF MANAGEMENT REVIEW},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {41},
Number = {4},
Pages = {720-738},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Why are some serious cases of corporate irresponsibility collectively
   forgotten? Drawing on social memory studies, we examine how this
   collective forgetting process can occur. We propose that a major
   instance of corporate irresponsibility leads to the emergence of a
   stakeholder mnemonic community that shares a common recollection of the
   past incident. This community generates and then draws on mnemonic
   traces to sustain a collective memory of the past event over time. In
   addition to the natural entropic tendency to forget, collective memory
   is also undermined by instrumental ``forgetting work,{''} which we
   conceptualize in this article. Forgetting work involves manipulating

Abstract = {We examine the role of history in organization studies by theorizing how
   collective memory shapes societal institutions and the logics that
   govern them. We propose that, rather than transhistorical ideal types,
   societal logics are historically constituted cultural structures
   generated through the collective memory of historical events. We then
   develop a theoretical model to explain how the representation, storage,
   and retrieval of collective memory lead to the emergence of societal
   logics. In turn, societal logics shape memory making and the
   reproduction and reconstruction of history itself. To illustrate our
   theory, we discuss the rise of the corporate logic in the United States.
   We identify two sources of discontinuity that can disrupt this
   memory-making process and create notable disjunctures in the evolution
   of societal logics. We conclude by discussing how changes in collective
   memory and the historical trajectory of societal logics shape
   organizational forms and practices.},

Title = {When Brand Logos Describe the Environment: Design Instability and the
   Utility of Safety-Oriented Products},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {43},
Number = {3},
Pages = {478-496},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {A core assumption underlying brand logo design is that inferences
   generated from a logo's design are applied to the consideration target
   (e. g., product or brand) to which the logo is attached, and designs
   should therefore reflect the beliefs one wishes to promote about the
   target. The current work demonstrates an important case in which
   consideration targets are resistant to particular inferences, which
   leads such inferences to be applied instead to one's environment.
   Specifically, when considering safety-oriented products, consumers
   exposed to unstablelooking brand logos infer the presence of unsafe
   conditions, and because safetyoriented products are resistant to
   inferences that they are unsafe, the inference is instead applied to the
   environment (i. e., `` the environment is unsafe{''}). This process
   subsequently increases the perceived utility of safety-oriented
   products. Five experiments collectively demonstrate the core effect,
   uncover the underlying inferential mechanism, and demonstrate the
   crucial role of inference resistance in the process. Overall, the
   present findings suggest that in some cases, a logo design that is
   opposed to desired product or brand beliefs may ironically help in
   boosting demand.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF CONSUMER PSYCHOLOGY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {26},
Number = {4},
Pages = {496-509},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Orienting a logo upward or downward may seem like an arbitrary graphic
   design decision, but we propose that it can have important implications
   for consumer judgments. In particular, we find across four experimental
   studies and a content analysis that diagonal direction can convey
   different levels of activity with upward or ascending diagonals
   conveying greater activity and effort than downward or descending
   diagonals. Consequently, when the context highlights the benefits of
   activity (vs. passivity), upward (vs. downward) diagonals lead to more
   favorable product judgments, greater product efficacy beliefs, and
   greater post-consumption satisfaction. Furthermore, we provide process
   evidence that perceived product efficacy beliefs mediate these effects,
   and that the effect is strongest when the object being visually oriented
   is text rather than images. These findings are particularly important in
   light of our content analysis findings that diagonal orientation is a
   relatively underutilized design feature. Collectively, our findings
   suggest that firms should use upward diagonals when the product context
   highlights a favorable view of activity. Otherwise, the firm should use
   downward diagonals, especially when the product context encourages
   consumers to view passivity favorably. (C) 2016 Society for Consumer

   As hypothesized, both studies showed that the negative relationship

   prohibitive (compared with promotive) voice. Results of Study 1 showed
   that, as hypothesized, leader-member exchange (LMX) moderated the
   relationship between contextual communication orientation and promotive
   voice, such that the relationship was negative when LMX was low but not
   significant when high. The interaction was not significant in predicting

Abstract = {This article examines the operation of flexible scheduling in practice
   through a case study of a large retail firm in the United Kingdom. It
   includes analysis of 39 semi-structured interviews, participant
   observation of shop floor work and non-participant observation of union
   organizing as well as analysis of key documents. The findings highlight
   the high level of generalized temporal flexibility across employment
   statuses. This temporal flexibility enables firm flexibility without
   necessitating a reliance upon contingent workers. Temporal flexibility
   is found to entail manager-control of flexible scheduling and is shown
   to be damaging to perceptions of job quality as it acts as a barrier to
   work-life balance. Union presence and collective bargaining at the firm
   are found to be ineffective at influencing flexible scheduling so as to
   improve job quality. This ineffectiveness can be explained by the union
   operating in an employer-dominated industrial relations environment in
   which its associational power is unable to compensate for a lack of
   institutional and structural economic power.},

Abstract = {In this study, we set out to better understand the dynamics behind
   group-based technology adoption by investigating the underlying
   mechanisms of changes in collective adoption decisions over time. Using
   a longitudinal multi-case study of production teams in the British oil
   and gas industry, we outline how internally or externally triggered
   modifications to the constellation of adoption rationales and attitudes
   toward a focal technology between subgroups caused changes to adoption
   decisions within a team. The constellations further seemed to impact
   usage patterns including conflicts about ICT use and the stability of
   adoption. Based on these observations, we suggest that group-based
   adoption can be differentiated in qualitatively different technology
   adoption states (TAS), which emerge as the result of disparate
   attitude-rationale configurations across subgroups in a user collective.
   With this reconceptualization of collective adoption as technology
   adoption states, our study extends current group-based models by
   providing a new, qualitative lens to view the creation and stability of
   adoption patterns in complex user groups. With this, our study offers a
   process view on the (dis)continuance of information systems and provides
   a basis for practical guidelines on how to deal with problematic
   adoption situations when actors from multiple (sub) groups are involved.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ETHICS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {137},
Number = {3},
Pages = {507-520},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Despite significant scholarly debate about knowledge production in the
   management discipline through the peer-review journal processes, there
   is minimal discussion about the ethical treatment of the research
   subject in these publication processes. In contrast, the ethical
   scrutiny of management research processes within research institutions
   is often highly formalized and very focused on the protection of
   research participants. Hence, the question arises of how management
   publication processes should best account for the interests of the
   research subject, both in the narrow sense of specific research
   participants and in the broader understanding of the subject of the
   research. This question is particularly pertinent in light of
   significant codification of research ethics within academic
   institutions, and increasing self-reflection within the management
   discipline about the ``good'' of management research and education.
   Findings from a survey and interviews with management journal editors
   (and others involved in journal publication) reveal a complex scenario;
   many editors believe that a formalized requirement within the journal
   publication process may have detrimental outcomes and, in fact, diminish
   the ethical integrity of management scholarship. Building on these
   findings, this paper argues that ethical concern for the research
   subject merely in terms of institutional rule compliance and avoidance
   of harm to individual participants is insufficient, and calls for
   explicitly positive engagement with both the individual and the
   collective subject of management research should receive due ethical
   consideration. An alternative model involving reflexive ethical
   consideration of research subjects across the publication process-with
   implications for role of authors, reviewers, editors, and research
   subjectsis outlined.},

   accrual accounting; (ii) a larger proportion of firms reporting
   significant special items; (iii) slower economic growth; (iv) more
   research and development activities; (v) larger service sectors; and
   (vi) stronger investor protection. We find no evidence that mandatory
   adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards affects
   matching. Changes in accounting and economic factors collectively
   explain the downward trend in matching. Overall, the results suggest
   that both accounting and economic factors are important determinants of
   matching over time and across countries.},

Title = {Social management capabilities of multinational buying firms and their

Volume = {46},
Number = {SI},
Pages = {19-37},

Abstract = {For sustainability, research in operations and supply chain management
   historically emphasized the development of environmental rather than
   social capabilities. However, factory disasters in Bangladesh, an
   emerging market and the second largest clothing exporter in the world,
   revealed enormous challenges in the implementation of social
   sustainability in complex global supply chains. Against the backdrop of
   a building collapse in Bangladesh's clothing industry, this research
   uses multiple case studies from two time periods to explore the skills,
   practices, relationships and processes collectively termed ``social
   management capabilities{''} (SMCs) - that help buyers and suppliers
   respond to stakeholder pressures; address regulatory gaps; and improve
   social performance. The study not only captures the perspectives of both
   multinational buyers and their emerging market suppliers, but also
   provides supplementary evidence from other key stakeholders, such as
   NGOs and unions. Our findings show that, in the absence of intense
   stakeholder pressure, buyers can lay the foundation for improved social
   performance by using their own auditors and collaborating with suppliers
   rather than using third-party auditors. However, in the face of acute
   attention from customers, NGOs and media, we observed that consultative
   buyer-consortium audits emerged, and shared third-party audits offered
   other advantages such as increased transparency and improvements in
   worker education and training. Finally, we present research propositions
   derived from our empirical study to guide future research on
   implementing social sustainability in emerging markets. (C) 2016 The

Abstract = {In addressing the notion of team ambidexterity, we propose that
   socio-psychological factors (i.e., team cohesion and team efficacy) may
   help team members to resolve paradoxical challenges and to combine
   exploratory and exploitative learning efforts. In addition, we theorize
   that senior executives may play an important role in facilitating the
   emergence of ambidexterity at lower hierarchical levels. In doing so, we
   develop a multilevel contingency framework and propose that the
   effectiveness of teams to achieve ambidexterity is contingent upon
   supportive leadership behaviours at the organizational-level. Using
   multilevel, multisource, and temporally separated data on 87 teams
   within 37 high-tech and pharmaceutical firms, we not only reveal how
   team cohesion and efficacy may matter for the emergence of team
   ambidexterity but also show that the effectiveness of supportive
   leadership behaviours from senior executives varies across cohesive and
   efficacious teams.},

   development over time in leader-member relationship, but also to
   within-person changes in active identities and behavioral styles that
   repeatedly occur. This complexity creates sensemaking challenges for all

   framework highlighting the distinct challenges these teams will face. In
   particular, our results show that each productivity factor contributed
   significantly more to team performance when the other factor was
   present. And our findings also illustrate a potential failure mode for
   knowledge utilization. If team members could not coordinate their
   collective efforts, utilizing knowledge undermined team performance. Our
   framework outlines a similar risk for too much coordination, if team
   members cannot utilize their specialized knowledge and are asked to
   perform a task with a ``rugged{''} performance landscape. We discuss the
   implications of our framework and results for theory and practice.},

Abstract = {Socially responsible human resource management (SRHRM), defined as
   corporate social responsibility (CSR) directed at employees, underpins
   the successful implementation of CSR. While its relationship with
   employee social behavior has been conceptualized and received some
   empirical support, its effect on employee work behaviors has not been
   explored. In this article we develop and test a meso-mediated moderation
   model that explains the underlying mechanisms through which SRHRM
   affects employee task performance and extra-role helping behavior. The
   results of multilevel analysis show that organization-level SRHRM is an
   indirect predictor of individual task performance and extra-role helping
   behavior through the mediation of individual-level organizational
   identification. In addition, the mediation model is moderated by
   employee-level perceived organizational support and the relationship
   between organizational identification and extra-role helping behavior is
   moderated by organization-level cooperative norms. These findings
   provide important insights into why and when SRHRM influences employee
   work behaviors.},

Abstract = {This paper offers a fresh perspective on national culture and
   entrepreneurship research. It explores the role of Culturally-endorsed
   implicit Leadership Theories (CLTs) - i.e, the cultural expectations
   about outstanding, ideal leadership - on individual entrepreneurship.
   Developing arguments based on culture-entrepreneurship fit, we predict
   that charismatic and self-protective CLTs positively affect
   entrepreneurship. They provide a context that enables entrepreneurs to
   be co-operative in order to initiate change but also to be
   self-protective and competitive so as to safeguard their venture and
   avoid being exploited. We further theorize that CLTs are more proximal
   drivers of cross-country differences in entrepreneurship as compared
   with distal cultural values. We find support for our propositions in a
   multi-level study of 42 countries. Cultural values (of uncertainty
   avoidance and collectivism) influence entrepreneurship mainly
   indirectly, via charismatic and self-protective CLTs. We do not find a
   similar indirect effect for cultural practices. (C) 2016 The Authors.

Abstract = {According to social learning theory, powerful and high status
   individuals can significantly influence the behaviors of others. In this
   paper, we propose that chief executive officers (CEOs) indirectly impact
   frontline injuries through the collective social learning experiences
   and effort of different groups of organizational actors-including
   members of the top management team (TMT), organizational supervisors,
   and frontline employees. We found support for our collective social
   learning model using data from 2,714 frontline employees, 1,398
   supervisors, and 229 members of TMTs in 54 organizations. TMT members'
   experiences within a CEO-driven TMT safety climate was positively
   related to organizational supervisors' reports of the broader
   organizational safety climate and their subsequent collective support
   for safety (reported by frontline employees). In turn, supervisory
   support for safety was associated with fewer employee injuries at the
   individual level. We discuss the theoretical and practical implications
   of these findings for workplace safety research and practice.},

   its announcement that it will not assert its patents against the OSS
   community and its creation of a patent commons. These decisions formed a
   coherent IP strategy in support of OSS. We find that IBM's actions
   stimulated new OSS product introductions by entrepreneurial firms and

   the market and the extent to which patent ownership in the market is

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The study of culture and decision making addresses variations in how and
   why people from different cultures sometimes tend to decide differently.
   This review is organized around what is intended to be a comprehensive
   analysis of the distinct fundamental questions that people must answer
   in the process of making virtually all real-life decisions. Our emphasis
   was on recent developments as well as identifying important yet
   neglected topics (e.g., how decision episodes get started-or not, and
   why some decisions are never implemented). Early as well as current
   efforts have focused mainly on East Asian and North American Caucasian
   cultures, with little treatment of other populations. In such studies,
   individualism and collectivism have been the dominant explanatory
   factors although related but distinct concepts such as ``tightness{''}
   and ``looseness{''} have been welcome additions to recent discussions.
   Throughout, the review emphasizes practical concerns, such as the
   challenges of intercultural learning and collaboration. (C) 2016

Journal = {ACADEMY OF MANAGEMENT JOURNAL},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {59},
Number = {4},

Abstract = {Based on a multi-year field study of early-stage drug discovery project
   teams at a global pharmaceutical company, this paper examines how
   multidisciplinary teams engaged in knowledge creation combine formal and
   informal coordination mechanisms when faced with unpredictable
   interdependencies among specialists' knowledge domains. While
   multidisciplinary teams are critical for knowledge creation in
   increasingly specialised work environments, the coordination literature
   has been divided with respect to the extent to which such teams rely on
   formal coordination structures and informal coordination practices. Our
   findings show that when interdependencies among knowledge domains are
   dynamic and unpredictable, specialists design self-managed (sub-)teams
   around collectively held assumptions about interdependencies based on
   incomplete information (conjectural interdependencies). These team
   structures establish the grounds for informal coordination practices
   that enable specialists to both manage known interdependencies and
   reveal new interdependencies. Newly revealed interdependencies among
   knowledge domains, in turn, promote structural adaptation. Drawing on
   these findings, we advance an integrative model explaining how
   team-based knowledge creation relies on the mutual constitution of
   formal coordination structures and informal coordination practices. The
   model contributes to theory on organizational design and practice-based
   research on coordination in cross-disciplinary knowledge creation.},

Abstract = {We analyze a bargaining situation in which preferences evolve over time

   of the status quo exacerbates the players' conflict of interest: Players
   disagree more often than under exogenous status quo. This leads to
   inefficiencies and status quo inertia. Under certain conditions, the
   negotiations can come to a complete gridlock: Players never reach an
   agreement. Gridlock can occur between players with arbitrarily similar
   preferences, provided they are sufficiently patient. In legislative
   settings, our model predicts polarization and explains why legislators
   may fail to react promptly to economic shocks.},

Volume = {59},
Number = {4},
Pages = {1174-1198},

Abstract = {There is a growing consensus that cooperative goal structures are more
   effective at motivating groups than competitive goal structures.
   However, such results are based largely on studies conducted in
   highly-controlled settings where participants were provided with the
   necessary resources to accomplish their assigned task. In an attempt to
   extend the boundary conditions of current theoretical predictions, we
   undertook a field experiment within a base-of-the-pyramid setting where
   resource scarcity is extremely high. Specifically, we collected data on
   44 communities within rural Sri Lanka who were tasked with contributing
   a portion of their resources to the construction of a school building;
   24 were assigned to a competition condition and 20 to a cooperation
   condition. The results of our field experiment, and subsequent follow-up
   interviews and focus groups, collectively suggest that competitive goal
   structures generally lead to higher levels of motivation within a
   resource scarce environment. However, our results also suggest that
   cooperative goal structures can be highly motivating when groups are
   unfamiliar with one another, as cooperating with unfamiliar groups can
   provide access to valuable and rare knowledge within such settings.},

   collectively governed by their stakeholders and we provide evidence that
   social capital improves the efficiency of stakeholder governance. In
   high social capital areas, banks raise more deposits locally, distribute
   more of their surplus for altruistic purposes, and operate more locally

Title = {Recognizing ``Me{''} Benefits ``We{''}: Investigating the Positive
   Spillover Effects of Formal Individual Recognition in Teams},

Abstract = {Many organizations use formal recognition programs (e.g., ``employee of
   the month{''}) as a way to publically acknowledge an individual
   employee's outstanding performance and motivate continued high
   performance. However, it remains unclear whether emphasizing individual
   achievement in a team context is beneficial or detrimental for
   recipients' teammates and, by extension, the team as a whole. Drawing on
   a social influence perspective, we examine potential spillover effects
   of individual formal recognition programs in teams. We hypothesize that
   a single team member's recognition will produce positive spillover
   effects on other team members' performance, as well as overall team
   performance, via social influence processes, especially when the award
   recipient is located in a central position in a team. Findings from 2
   lab experiments of 24 teams and 40 teams (Study 1 and Study 2,
   respectively) and a field experiment of 52 manufacturing teams (Study 3)
   reveal that formally recognizing a team member leads to positive changes
   in her/his teammates' individual and collective performance. Thus,
   formal social recognition programs can potentially provide a
   motivational effect beyond individual recipients.},

Abstract = {The great challenge of sustainability is addressed by firms with varying
   levels of social and environmental responsibility and performance.
   Though traditionally, firms sought a balance, we argue that this is not
   enough. Rather, we advocate that the natural environment be the
   foundation on which society resides and the economy operates.
   Sustainable, ethical, entrepreneurial (SEE) enterprises are moving in
   this direction, seeking to regenerate the environment and drive positive
   societal changes rather than only minimizing harm. We also note that
   sustainability is justified and motivated by ethical considerations and
   pioneered by entrepreneurial engagement. The eight articles included in
   this Special Issue draw from cross-disciplinary scholarship to elaborate
   how SEE enterprises approach sustainability through new organizational
   forms, business models and innovation, and new governance mechanisms.
   They also emphasize the roles of institutional forces and logics,
   government policies and social movements for promoting or impeding
   sustainable practices. Collectively, they reveal new and compelling
   insights while spotlighting the great questions for SEE enterprise that
   await study.},

Journal = {ORGANIZATION STUDIES},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {37},
Number = {7},
Pages = {963-990},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {This article focuses on the dynamics and interplay of meaning, emotions,
   and power in institutional work. Based on an empirical study, we explore
   and elaborate on the rhetorical strategies of emotion work that
   institutional actors employ to mobilize emotions for discursive
   institutional work. In an empirical context where a powerful
   institutional actor is tasked with creating support and acceptance for a
   new political and economic institution, we identify three rhetorical
   strategies of emotion work: eclipsing, diverting and evoking emotions.
   These strategies are employed to arouse, regulate, and organize emotions
   that underpin legitimacy judgments and drive resistance among field
   constituents. We find that actors exercise influence and engage in overt
   forms of emotion work by evoking shame and pride to sanction and reward
   particular expedient ways of thinking and feeling about the new
   institutional arrangements. More importantly, however, the study shows
   that they also engage in strategies of discursive institutional work
   that seek to exert powerforce and influencein more subtle ways by
   eclipsing and diverting the collective fears, anxieties, and moral
   indignation that drive resistance and breed negative legitimacy
   evaluations. Overall, the study suggests that emotions play an important
   role in institutional work associated with creating institutions, not
   only via pathos appeals but also as tools of discursive,
   cultural-cognitive meaning work and in the exercise of power in the
   field.},

Abstract = {Exclusive dealing contracts between manufacturers and retailers force
   new entrants to set up their own costly dealer networks to enter the
   market. We ask whether such contracts may act as an entry barrier, and
   provide an empirical analysis of the European car market. We first
   estimate a demand model with product and spatial differentiation, and
   quantify consumers' valuations for dealer proximity and dealer
   exclusivity. We then perform policy counterfactuals to assess the profit
   incentives and possible entry-deterring effects of exclusive dealing. We
   find that there are no unilateral incentives to maintain exclusive
   dealing, but there is a collective incentive for the industry as a
   whole. Furthermore, a ban on exclusive dealing would raise the smaller
   entrants' market share. But more importantly, consumers would gain, not
   so much because of increased price competition, but rather because of
   the increased spatial availability, which compensates for the demand
   inefficiency from a loss of dealer exclusivity.},

Abstract = {This research documents consumers' potential to monitor corporations'
   License to Operate through their consumption responses to corporate
   social responsibility failures. The premise is that the type of social
   contracts or standards in place may determine how consumers, through
   their individual and collective behaviors, can play a direct role in
   influencing corporate behavior, when corporations fail to meet social
   responsibility standards. An experiment conducted with a large sample of
   consumers in the United States shows that consumers respond differently
   to a company's failure in its social responsibilities depending on
   whether the violated standard is a government mandate or a voluntary
   commitment and depending on the consumers' own environmental
   consciousness. The findings highlight the potential power of individual
   consumers and consumer collectives in narrowing the governance gaps
   relative to social and environmental issues and reducing the likelihood
   of CSR failures.},

Abstract = {Sociocultural factors are important determinants of merger and

   understanding of sociocultural factors in M\&As remains incomplete. In
   particular, the roles of sociocultural interfirm linkages, HR
   flexibility, and organizational cultural differences in M\&As require
   further elucidation. The present article contributes to the M\&A
   literature by further clarifying the multifaceted role of these
   sociocultural factors in M\&As. We suggest that sociocultural interfirm
   linkages (complementary employee skills, trust, collective teaching, and
   cultural integration) between the merging firms influence the level of
   knowledge transfer in M\&As. Furthermore, we argue that HR flexibility
   (flexibility in employee skills, flexibility in employee behavior, and
   flexibility in HR practices) is vital for the development of the
   above-mentioned sociocultural interfirm linkages in M\&As. Finally, we
   maintain that organizational cultural differences are important
   antecedents of HR flexibility in M\&As.},

Abstract = {Research summary: This paper uses signaling theory to bring together two
   complementary research streams that have largely ignored each other:
   strategic human resource management and media relations management. We
   argue that when publicly traded firms voluntarily and publicly disclose
   positive information about their value creation and appropriation
   activities, they also send positive signals to managerial labor markets
   regarding executives' capabilities. Accordingly, we hypothesize a
   positive association between public disclosures and voluntary executive
   turnover. An analysis of pharmaceutical and communications equipment
   firms from 1990 to 2004 supports this prediction, underscoring the need
   to understand better the effects of voluntary public disclosures on a
   firm's ability to protect its human capital. More generally, our results
   highlight the importance of considering the impact of a single signal on
   multiple receivers.
   Managerial summary: Given the organizational benefits of positive media
   coverage, the considerable effort that firms put into managing their
   image in the media is not surprising. We argue and show, however, that
   when a firm enhances its public image it also improves its executives'
   positions in the managerial labor market and, by so doing, increases
   their likelihood of voluntarily leaving the firm. In particular, we find
   that corporate press releases, an important mechanism for managing
   information released in the public domain to signal a firm's competitive
   advantages, may result in unintentional loss of senior management
   talent. This trade-off suggests that firms should increase coordination
   between their strategy, human resources, and corporate
   communications/investor relations departments to ensure that they
   collectively weigh the benefits and costs of publicly disclosing
   value-relevant information. Copyright (C) 2015 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Abstract = {Despite the importance of organizational misconduct, still not much is
   known about coordinated misconduct between firms. In this study, we seek
   a better understanding of how the profile of the partners involved in
   cartels affects the longevity of their joint misconduct activities.
   Drawing upon diversity theory, we leverage a distinction between three
   types of diversity-variety of age-based experience, separation in
   uncertainty avoidance, and power disparity-in collective organizational
   misconduct between firms, and study their respective influence on the
   longevity of cartels. Our empirical analysis gives support to our main
   arguments: the longevity of cartels tends to be increased by the level
   of variety of age-based experience and power disparity between partners
   but reduced by their level of separation in uncertainty avoidance.
   Implications for the literature on organizational misconduct are
   discussed.},

Title = {RETRACTED: THE BEHAVIORAL THEORY OF THE (GOVERNED) FIRM: CORPORATE BOARD
   INFLUENCES ON ORGANIZATIONS' RESPONSES TO PERFORMANCE SHORTFALLS
   (Retracted Article)},
Journal = {ACADEMY OF MANAGEMENT JOURNAL},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {59},
Number = {3},
Pages = {860-879},
Month = {JUN 1},
Abstract = {The Behavioral Theory of the Firm provides a well-evidenced perspective
   on organizational decision making that has influenced a wide array of
   literatures, including the substantial body of work on organizational
   change. This literature suggests that organizations are more likely to
   undertake major changes when their performance declines below
   aspirations or targets for acceptable performance, but few studies
   examine how multiple groups of organizational decision makers, each with
   potentially conflicting interests, might collectively influence this
   process. To that end, I incorporate theory regarding corporate boards
   and their role in organizational decision making. I use this integration
   to suggest that boards with particular characteristics may have
   interests that do not align with those of the management team when
   performance shortfalls occur, using their influence to force compromises
   or compel managers to reconsider particular changes. I find support for
   the related predictions that an increase in board size and equity
   ownership suppresses change when performance drops, although I find no
   support for similar arguments regarding board turnover. This approach
   blends the typically distinct but related literatures on performance
   feedback and corporate governance, and suggests the role that some
   boards might play in circumventing the momentum for organizational
   change.},

   auditor, suggesting that higher-quality audits substitute for short-term
   debt for monitoring purposes. In additional analyses, we find that the
   role that auditor choice plays in debt maturity is concentrated in firms
   from countries with strong legal institutions governing property rights
   and creditor rights. Collectively, our research implies that Big Four
   audits matter to corporate debt maturity, although the impact is
   isolated in firms operating in countries with more protective legal
   regimes.},

Title = {Framing Innovation Opportunities While Staying Committed to an
   Organizational Epistemic Stance},
Journal = {INFORMATION SYSTEMS RESEARCH},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {27},
Number = {2},
Pages = {302-323},

Abstract = {This paper examines how an organization's culture, and in particular its
   stance toward the pursuit of knowledge and innovation, matters when
   confronting new digitally enabled practices for generating novel
   insights. We draw on an in-depth interpretive study of how two
   innovation consulting firms encountered crowdsourcing for innovation.
   Our findings suggest that, although both organizations relied on a
   similar set of organizational arrangements in their daily consulting
   work, they enacted different positions vis-a-vis crowdsourcing: one firm
   further experimented with it, whereas the other rejected it altogether.
   These different positions emerged as organizational actors examined,
   framed, and evaluated crowdsourcing as an alternative for generating
   knowledge. To interpret these findings, we draw on philosophy of science
   and develop the concept of organizational epistemic stance, defined as
   an attitude that organizational actors collectively enact in pursuing
   knowledge. Our analysis suggests that when organizational actors
   encounter and explore information technology-enabled practices, such as
   crowdsourcing and big data analytics, they are likely to remain
   committed to their epistemic stance to frame such practices and judge
   their potential value for pursuing knowledge. This paper contributes to
   our understanding of encounters with, and adoption and diffusion of, new
   organizational practices and offers new ways of thinking about
   crowdsourcing.},

Title = {A TWO-PHASE LONGITUDINAL MODEL OF A TURNOVER EVENT: DISRUPTION, RECOVERY

Journal = {ACADEMY OF MANAGEMENT JOURNAL},

Volume = {59},

Abstract = {Blending theory on collective turnover and group adaptability, this
   paper develops a two-phase longitudinal model that explains how and why
   an individual-level turnover event has effects on collective
   performance. Phase 1 (disruption) is marked by a sudden and negative
   change in unit-level performance, while Phase 2 (recovery) entails a
   gradual increase in unit performance over time. We further propose that
   the positional distribution (manager or employee) of the turnover event
   and the amount of interdependence within the collective will influence
   the consequences of a turnover event. Using a sample of 524 branches of
   a U.S. bank, the results largely support the hypotheses as a turnover
   event leads to an immediate and negative change in branch-level
   performance. Notably, there is an interaction between manager and
   employee turnover events that significantly decreases performance. In
   the recovery period, branches recover more quickly after losing an
   employee than they do after losing a manager. However, the moderating
   effect of branch-level interdependence depends on the position, and
   there is no statistically significant recovery from a manager turnover
   event within our performance window. These results highlight the
   insights of our two-phase model and the need to study collective
   turnover dynamics over time and across different positions.},

   MEDIA DIGITIZATION IN THE CASE OF THE SOPA DISCOURSE},
Journal = {MIS QUARTERLY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {40},
Number = {2, SI},

Abstract = {Mass media digitization is an unfolding phenomenon, posing novel
   societal opportunities and challenges that researchers are beginning to
   note. We build on and extend MIS research on process digitization and
   digital versus traditional communication media to study how and to what
   extent social media-one form of digital mass media-are emancipatory
   (i.e., permitting wide-spread participation in public discourse and
   surfacing of diverse perspectives) versus hegemonic (i.e., contributing
   to ideological control by a few). While a pressing concern to activists
   and scholars, systematic study of this issue has been elusive, owing
   partially to the complexity of the emancipation and hegemony concepts.
   Using a case study approach, we iteratively engaged with data on the
   discourse surrounding the Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA) and source
   literature to identify six facets of interpretive media packages (i.e.,
   competing social constructions of an issue) as measurable constructs
   pertinent to emancipation and hegemony. These facets included three
   structural constraints (on authorship, citation, and influence) and
   three content restrictions (on frames, signatures, and emotion). We
   investigated propositions regarding effects of social versus traditional
   media and lean versus rich social media on these interpretive media
   package facets by comparing the SOPA discourse across two lean
   traditional and social media (newspapers and Twitter) and two rich
   traditional and social media (television and YouTube). Our findings
   paradoxically revealed social media to be emancipatory with regard to
   structural constraints, but hegemonic with regard to an important
   content restriction (i.e., frames). Lean social media mitigated
   structural advantages and exacerbated content problems. These findings
   suggest that, as with traditional media, some inevitable evils accompany
   the societal benefits of social media and that mass media is having a
   detrimental effect on public discourse. We offer practical steps by
   which private and public institutions may counter this effect,
   theoretical implications for wider consideration of the six interpretive
   media package facets proposed here, and encouragement to MIS researchers
   to increase their efforts to compare different digitized processes so
   that a more comprehensive theory of the effects of different forms of
   digitized processes can be developed.},

Abstract = {Emerging from rapid advances in digitization and technological
   capabilities is a new form of information systems development project:
   cyber projects. Cyber projects are complex, massive, and ambitious,
   often involving hundreds of academic, government, and industry
   professionals, requiring years of development, and costing millions of
   dollars. In our study, we examine how control is exercised in cyber
   projects. Based on a longitudinal study over eight years, we develop a
   process theory of the control of cyber projects. Initially we observe
   that project control is driven by the field, i.e., all of the individual
   or collective entities that subscribe to the general purpose of the
   project. This form of control is later replaced by a more bureaucratic
   form from government-sponsored entities to ensure that traditional
   project objectives are met. Once construction begins and the field
   understands the implications and promise of the project, we observe that
   control is again exerted by the primary project users in the field,
   complemented by authority-based control exerted by the
   government-sponsored entisty in the field.},

Journal = {ACADEMY OF MANAGEMENT JOURNAL},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {59},
Number = {3},
Pages = {1088-1111},
Month = {JUN 1},
Abstract = {Using data from 607 subjects organized into 161 teams (84 laboratory
   teams, 77 organizational field teams), we examined how leader humility
   influences team interaction patterns, emergent states, and team
   performance. We develop and test a theoretical model, positing that,
   when leaders behave humbly, followers emulate their humble behaviors,
   creating a shared interpersonal team process (collective humility).
   This, in turn, creates a team emergent state focused on progressively
   striving toward achieving the team's highest potential (collective
   promotion focus), which ultimately enhances team performance. We test
   our model across three studies wherein we manipulate leader humility to
   test the social contagion hypothesis (Study 1), examine the impact of
   humility on team processes and performance in a longitudinal team
   simulation (Study 2), and test the full model in a multistage field
   study in a health services context (Study 3). Our findings collectively
   support our theoretical model, demonstrating that leader behavior can
   spread via social contagion to followers, producing an emergent state
   that ultimately affects team performance. We contribute to the
   leadership literature by suggesting the need for leaders to lead by
   example and showing how a specific set of leader behaviors influence
   team performance, providing a template for future leadership research on
   a wide variety of leader behaviors.},

   ORGANIZATION},
Journal = {MIS QUARTERLY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {40},
Number = {2, SI},
Pages = {331+},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {An emerging research agenda focuses on social media's influence on
   political activism. Specific attention has recently been paid to digital
   social movement organizing and action repertoire development. The
   literature acknowledges the changing face of activism at the movement
   level, but little is known about the relationship between social
   movement organizations (SMOs) and digital action repertoires.
   Understanding this relationship is critical because strong adherence to
   values is at the heart of establishing action repertoires with
   legitimacy and persistence. In this paper, we rely on a two-year
   longitudinal study of the Swedish affiliate of Amnesty International. We
   examine the transformation in engagement and interaction that followed
   the organization's introduction of new action repertoires. Drawing on
   resource mobilization theory and the collective action space model, we
   elaborate how new action repertoires both stabilized and challenged the
   values of the SMO, as well as gradually broadened the interactions of
   supporters and deepened their modes of engagement. We offer a
   value-based model on the antecedents and effects of new action
   repertoires from the SMO perspective. The empirical findings and the
   model build new theory on social media and digital activism at the
   organizational level, complementing the predominant movement level
   research in the extant literature.},

Abstract = {Knowledge creation is a collective and social activity, and a large body
   of research has established that knowledge creation by researchers
   (knowledge workers) is influenced by their direct exchange partners. We
   examine why knowledge worker ego networks are structured as they are,
   but also why and how knowledge worker networks change over time. We
   examine two changes to knowledge workers' ego networks: the addition of
   new direct exchange partners and the deletion of existing direct
   exchange partners. Our study offers important evidence that two network
   dimensions (tie strength between ego and his or her alters, and the
   level of connectivity among ego's alters) provide distinctive insight
   into how networks change. Importantly, our study provides evidence that
   three critical components of the knowledge creation processaccess to
   diverse and redundant resources, shared experiences and tacit mutual
   understanding to develop the resources, and previous knowledge
   creationsact as causal mechanisms behind network changes in subsequent
   periods. Our study is at the individual level as we study biomedical
   research scientists and their direct exchange partnersthe others to whom

Year = {2016},
Volume = {27},
Number = {3, SI},
Pages = {678-697},
Month = {MAY-JUN},
Abstract = {In this paper, we examine the role of reflective talk in how routines
   change. We argue that talk enables routine participants to collectively
   reflect on the routine and work out new ways of enacting it. Drawing on
   a year-long ethnographic study of a start-up company in the
   pharmaceutical industry, we show that talk supports the enactment of
   collective reflection by enabling the participants to (1) name and
   situate the issue to be discussed with regard to the performative and
   ostensive aspects of the routine, (2) jointly envisage and explore
   alternative ways of enacting the routine, and (3) evaluate and question
   these suggestions from different angles. We examine how these aspects of
   reflective talk play out in different types of routine change and how
   the progressive unfolding of the talk reveals distinct opportunities for
   routine change. With our findings, we shed light on the role of
   collective reflection in routine change, on variation and selective
   retention in routine change, and on how organizational members balance
   the need for consistency and change in the enactment of routines.},

Abstract = {This study examined whether the cultures of low-and high-power
   negotiators interact to influence cooperative behavior of low-power
   negotiators. Managers from 4 different cultural groups (Germany, Hong
   Kong, Israel, and the United States) negotiated face-to-face in a
   simulated power-asymmetric commons dilemma. Results supported an
   interaction effect in which cooperation of people with lower power was
   influenced by both their culture and the culture of the person with
   higher power. In particular, in a multicultural setting, low-power
   managers from Hong Kong, a vertical-collectivist culture emphasizing
   power differences and group alignment, adjusted their cooperation
   depending on the culture of the high-power manager with whom they
   interacted. This study contributes to understanding how culture shapes
   behavior of people with relatively low power, illustrates how a logic of
   appropriateness informs cooperation, and highlights the importance of
   studying multicultural social interactions in the context of
   negotiations, work teams, and global leadership.},

Abstract = {Recent advances in leadership research suggest that collective-focused
   leadership climate and differentiated individual-focused leadership
   might simultaneously, yet oppositely, affect collective outcomes. The
   present study extends this literature by addressing open questions
   regarding theory, methods, statistics, and level of analysis. Therefore,
   a new and more parsimonious theoretical model is developed on the
   organizational-level of analysis. Drawing on the commitment literature,
   we argue for opposite relations of the two leadership constructs on the
   affective organizational commitment climate. We subsequently theorize
   that contingent-reward leadership climate moderates these opposing
   relationships, making our study the first in this field to investigate
   moderators. Last, we reason that organizational effectiveness is
   enhanced when affective commitment is put into action and raises the
   organizational citizenship behavior climate. Our three-path
   moderated-mediation hypotheses are tested, and supported, by structural
   equation modeling analyses in a multisource data set containing 16,911
   respondents from 157 companies. Extensive alternative model testing
   shows that our theory and findings are robust.},

Title = {How Business Customers Judge Solutions: Solution Quality and Value in
   Use},

Abstract = {Many manufacturers look to business solutions to provide growth;
   however, success is far from guaranteed, and it is unclear how such
   solutions can create superior perceived value. This article explores
   what constitutes value for customers from solutions over
   time-conceptualized as ``value in use{''}-and how this arises from
   quality perceptions of the solution's components. The authors develop a
   framework for solution quality and value in use through 36 interviews
   combining repertory grid technique and means-end chains. The findings
   significantly extend the extant view of quality as a function of the
   supplier's products and services, and show that customers also assess
   the quality of their own resources and processes, as well as the quality
   of the joint resource integration process. The authors report that value
   in use corresponds not just to collective, organizational goals but also
   to individuals' goals, a finding that strongly contrasts with prior
   research. Four moderators of the quality-value relationship demonstrate
   customer heterogeneity across both firms and roles within what the
   authors term the ``usage center.{''} When shifting toward solutions,
   manufacturers require very different approaches to market research;
   account management; solution design; and quality control, including the
   need for value-auditing processes.},

Abstract = {We study a model of collective real-time decision making (or learning)
   in a social network operating in an uncertain environment, for which no
   a priori probabilistic model is available. Instead, the environment's
   impact on the agents in the network is seen through a sequence of cost
   functions, revealed to the agents in a causal manner only after all the
   relevant actions are taken. There are two kinds of costs: individual
   costs incurred by each agent and local-interaction costs incurred by
   each agent and its neighbors in the social network. Moreover, agents
   have inertia: each agent has a default mixed strategy that stays fixed
   regardless of the state of the environment, and must expend effort to
   deviate from this strategy in order to respond to cost signals coming
   from the environment. We construct a decentralized strategy, wherein
   each agent selects its action based only on the costs directly affecting
   it and on the decisions made by its neighbors in the network. In this
   setting, we quantify social learning in terms of regret, which is given
   by the difference between the realized network performance over a given
   time horizon and the best performance that could have been achieved in
   hindsight by a fictitious centralized entity with full knowledge of the
   environment's evolution. We show that our strategy achieves the regret
   that scales polylogarithmically with the time horizon and polynomially
   with the number of agents and the maximum number of neighbors of any
   agent in the social network.},

Abstract = {This study investigates the impact of language barriers on multilingual
   virtual teams members' choice between different communication media in
   their inner team interactions. Through interviewing team leaders and
   members in both mono- and multilingual virtual teams, we discover
   discrepancies in media choice and media performance between these two
   settings and identify foreign language-induced cognitive load as a key
   reason for these divergences. Our study advances research on
   communication and knowledge exchange in multilingual virtual
   collaboration by showing how language barriers alter the process of
   converging different viewpoints through team interaction, by suggesting
   language-related modifications to the seminal media synchronicity
   theory, and by demonstrating the benefits of new media in multilingual
   settings. It also broadens the disciplinary scope of language research
   in international business by introducing theories from communication
   studies and cognitive research. In practical terms, it highlights the
   benefits of redundant communication, the need for an adequate media
   infrastructure in multinational corporations and the importance of
   motivating team members to use new media.},

Abstract = {We develop and use an integrated individual-level model to explain the
   driving forces behind digital piracy (DP) practice in two nations. The
   proposed model combines the Norm Activation model and Unified Theory of
   Acceptance and Use of Technology models. This study also explores the
   effect of culture on intention (INT) to practice DP in two nations: US
   (individualistic) and India (collectivistic). A survey instrument was
   used to collect data from 231 US and 331 Indian participants. Use of the
   integrated model proves to be a powerful and a viable approach to
   understanding DP across cultures. In each nation, all 10 path
   coefficients on the research model are statistically significant thereby
   establishing the fact that personal norm, together with other factors,
   influences INT to engage in DP, which in turn, may influence the actual
   practice. The results reveal a support for cross-cultural
   generalizability and applicability of the proposed model. Culture
   clearly plays a strong moderating role in two out of the three paths
   tested. The implications of the findings are discussed.},

Abstract = {As forms of private self-regulation, multi-stakeholder initiatives
   (MSIs) have emerged as an important empirical phenomenon in global

   intriguing because of their inherent double nature. On the one hand,
   MSIs spell out CSR standards that define norms for corporate behavior.
   On the other hand, MSIs are also the result of corporate and stakeholder
   behavior. We combine the perspectives of institutional theory and club
   theory to conceptualize this double nature of MSIs. Based on a stage
   model that looks at the interplay of actor and institutional dynamics,
   we generate insights into why actors join a voluntary MSI, how the
   various motivations and intentions of the actors influence the standard
   development, and how these as well as the MSI design are subsequently
   influenced by both external (institutional) and internal (club)
   dynamics.},

Abstract = {If individuals own the right to take any action that they please, and
   are free to contract about behaviour, will outcomes be efficient in all
   situations? That is, does the Coase theorem hold? We study this classic
   question through the lens of a non-cooperative model of contract
   negotiations, considering both compulsory and voluntary participation in
   negotiations. In either case, we find that all consistent equilibria of
   the contracting game are efficient in the case of two players. But if
   participation is voluntary, and there are more than two players, there
   are situations in which all consistent equilibria are inefficient.
   Specifically, the provision of public goods tends to be inefficiently
   low due to strategic abstention from contracting. Free-riding on others'
   agreements can be avoided if individuals do not own all their actions.
   When actions involve the use of assets, efficient action ownership may
   correspond to collective rather than individual asset ownership.},

Abstract = {Drawing on human and social capital theory, research on employee
   mobility has discussed the benefits and drawbacks of hiring employees
   from rival firms. To explain the performance implications of employee
   mobility, the literature has focused on what moving individuals can do,
   but has ignored what they are willing to do. However, to fully
   understand what individuals will actually do at the new firm, we need to
   understand both. We argue that what individuals are willing to do
   depends on their collective and relational identity. When competing
   against a former employer, individuals experience a conflict in their
   collective identity as they identify with both organizations but can
   only increase the welfare of one. To reduce this conflict, individuals
   strengthen their identification with the new organization and deidentify
   with the former by competing harder against the former organization. At
   the relational level, individuals can still identify with their
   ex-colleagues without harming the welfare of the new organization by
   competing harder with non-former colleagues but behaving less
   competitively toward former colleagues. We analyze data from the
   National Hockey League and find strong support for our hypotheses.},

Title = {Efficient Implementation of Collective Extended Producer Responsibility
   Legislation},

Year = {2016},

Abstract = {Extended producer responsibility (EPR) is a policy tool that holds
   producers financially responsible for the post-use collection,
   recycling, and disposal of their products. Many EPR implementations are
   collective-a large collection and recycling network (CRN) handles
   multiple producers' products in order to benefit from scale and scope
   economies. The total cost is then allocated to producers based on
   metrics such as their return shares by weight. Such weight-based
   proportional allocation mechanisms are criticized in practice for not
   taking into account the heterogeneity in the costs imposed by different
   producers' products. The consequence is cost allocations that impose
   higher costs on certain producer groups than they can achieve
   independently. This may lead some producers to break away from
   collective systems, resulting in fragmented systems with higher total
   cost. Yet cost efficiency is a key legislative and producer concern. To
   address this concern, this paper develops cost allocation mechanisms
   that induce participation in collective systems and maximize cost
   efficiency. The cost allocation mechanisms we propose consist of
   adjustments to the widely used return share method and include the
   weighing of return shares based on processing costs and the rewarding of
   capacity contributions to collective systems. We validate our
   theoretical results using Washington state EPR implementation data and
   provide insights into how these mechanisms can be implemented in

Abstract = {This paper examines the effectiveness of public enforcement by studying
   the effects of regulatory intervention to curb tunneling through
   intercorporate loans in China. Specifically, we explore whether public
   enforcement efforts in 2006 (blacklisting and sanctions) resulted in
   less tunneling, and ultimately in increased performance for tunneling
   firms. We show that tunneling is among the dominant factors increasing
   the likelihood of becoming blacklisted. We also find that firms'
   tunneling mechanisms decreased significantly after the regulatory shock,
   and that their performance increased significantly compared to
   non-tunneling firms after the regulatory shock. Finally, we find a
   positive market reaction to the public announcement of tunneling both
   for firms that have been blacklisted and other tunneling firms that are
   not blacklisted. Collectively, these results suggest that public
   enforcement in the presence of a credible threat succeeds in deterring
   the effect on tunneling behavior in China.},

Abstract = {This study explores whether the negative impact of groupthink
   concurrence-seeking behavior (GTB) on business process reengineering
   (BPR) projects is affected by group members personal traits and
   interpersonal ties within the group. To this purpose we conduct and
   present the results of a longitudinal controlled field experiment over
   18 BPR projects lasting 3months and involving 18 teams comprising 71
   first-year MBA students. The main contribution of this study is twofold.
   First, we explicitly consider and measure the core construct of
   groupthink phenomenon: that is, GTB. Existing organizational behavior
   literature has, contrarily, considered only its causes, symptoms, and
   outcomes. Second, we show evidence that GTB does have a negative impact
   on group performance in BPR project settings. In this regards, results
   also indicate that while perceived control, conscientiousness and
   interpersonal evaluation mitigate the negative impact of GTB on group
   project performance, confidence, and previous relationships amplify this
   negative impact, even if they have a direct positive effect on
   performance. Thanks to the findings of this study, we are able to
   provide valuable suggestions to managers in charge of BPR projects for
   ensuring effective performance of project teams and controlling for
   potential obstacles due to GTB.},

Abstract = {This paper demonstrates how meta-analysis can be combined with
   structural equation modeling (MASEM) to address new questions in
   strategic management research. We review this integration, describe its
   implementation, and compare findings from bivariate meta-analyses, a
   direct-effect structural equations model, and two mediating frameworks
   using data on the strategic leadership and performance relationship.
   Results drawn from 208 articles that collectively included data on
   495,638 observations demonstrate the new insights available from MASEM
   while also suggesting a revision to conventional thinking on strategic
   leadership. Whereas some theories posit that boards of directors
   influence firm performance through monitoring and disciplining the top
   management team, MASEM provides more support for the view that boards
   mediate the top management teams' decisions. Implications for applying
   MASEM in strategic management are offered. Copyright (c) 2014 John Wiley

Title = {When Does Pre-IPO Financial Reporting Trigger Post-IPO Legal
   Consequences?},
Journal = {CONTEMPORARY ACCOUNTING RESEARCH},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {33},
Number = {1},
Pages = {378-411},
Month = {SPR},
Abstract = {Prior research suggests that the fear of litigation precludes most
   managers from manipulating earnings in the initial public offering (IPO)
   setting. Yet, managers' restraint is perhaps unwarranted: research has
   not yet linked instances of aggressive pre-IPO reporting to increased
   litigation risk. This paper investigates when aggressive IPO reporting
   triggers legal consequences. Examining 2,037 IPOs, we find that even
   when ex post evidence indicates the presence of earnings inflation,
   litigation is more likely to occur when investors have relied on the
   suspect earnings during the pricing process. Why might investors rely on
   some firms' abnormal accruals when valuing the IPO and yet discount the
   abnormal accruals of other firms? Our analyses suggest that IPO
   investors incorporate abnormal accrual information into IPO prices
   insituations where accruals are more likely to reflect information and
   where other sources of information to help investors make pricing
   decisions are lacking or are less reliable. In these situations, we find
   that abnormal accruals do positively correlate with future performance,
   validating investors' use of this information when pricing these
   offerings. Yet, when ex post performance reveals that these pre-IPO
   abnormal accruals were in fact inflated, we find that litigation emerges
   to allow harmed shareholders to recover losses incurred dating back to
   the pricing processimportantly, investors are only harmed if they used
   those abnormal accruals in pricing the IPO. Collectively, our evidence
   indicates that litigation in response to earnings inflation does indeed
   surface in the IPO settingbut only when investors need it to settle the
   score.},

Volume = {134},
Number = {3},

Abstract = {We examine the equity valuation effect of press releases of upgrades or
   downgrades reflected in the Covalence Ethical Quote (CEQ), an index
   ranking the ethical performance of multinational firms. The index is
   updated quarterly and is comprehensive enough to include 45 criteria
   reflecting working conditions, impact of product, impact of production,
   and company institutional impact. Thus, it captures many dimensions of
   firms' ethical performance that are not accounted for in previous
   research. Our research encompasses a joint test of the value relevance
   of the index itself and the impact of ethical reputation on a firm's
   value. We find first a significant causal relationship between stock
   market reactions and changes in the CEQ. Specifically, disclosures of
   positive (negative) changes in firm ethical performance cause increases
   (decreases) in firm value. Second, cross-sectional analysis indicates a
   positive association between changes in firm ethical performance and
   both its financial performance and its financial reporting quality.
   Collectively, these results suggest that the CEQ conveys information
   that is useful to investors. Further, corporate measures taken to
   increase ethical performance are associated with positive benefits to
   shareholders. Finally, investors have concluded that good news about
   their firms' efforts to be ethical is worth the cost.},

Abstract = {The striking growth of online communities in recent years has sparked
   significant interest in understanding and quantifying benefits of
   participation. While research has begun to document the economic
   outcomes associated with online communities, quantifying the social
   value created in these collectives has been largely overlooked. This
   study proposes that online health communities create social value by
   addressing rural-urban health disparities via improved health
   capabilities. Using a unique data set from a rare disease community, we
   provide one of the first empirical studies of social value creation. Our
   quantitative analysis using exponential random graph models reveals
   patterns of social support exchanged between users and the variations in
   these patterns based on users' location. We find that, overall, urban
   users are net suppliers of social support while rural participants are
   net recipients, suggesting that technology-mediated online health
   communities are able to alleviate rural-urban health disparities. This
   study advances extant understanding of value production in online
   collectives, and yields implications for policy.},

Title = {When the ``unorganizable' organize: The collective mobilization of

Journal = {HUMAN RELATIONS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {69},
Number = {3},

Abstract = {The collective mobilization of migrant workers is an important issue for
   analysis. Three key barriers to the mobilization of migrant workers have
   been identified - employment conditions, which tend to prevent migrant
   workers coming together; the framings held by migrant workers, which
   marginalize an understanding of their position as that of exploited
   workers; and the issue of the sustainability of any mobilization. The
   article examines migrant domestic workers as a case in which collective
   mobilization appears highly unlikely. The article uses the social
   movement approach as a meta-theoretical framing to explore the
   collective mobilization of migrant domestic workers in London. As such,
   it analyses how the unorganizable' organize. We show that mobilization
   changed the framing of migrant domestic workers from labourers of love'
   to workers with rights. It was able to do this because it addressed the
   three barriers to mobilization: by creating a space for the development
   of communities of coping among migrant workers; by using politicized
   learning; and by using participative democracy and collective leadership
   development, tied to links with formal organizations. The article argues
   for the importance of social scientists examining the creative processes
   by which migrant workers move towards collective mobilization, and for
   the utility of a social movement approach in this process.},

Abstract = {This study has evaluated the relationship between debt in the capital
   structure of firms and the dynamics of broadband and digital technology
   adoption in the United States, based on a large dataset on local
   exchange carriers in the United States over a contemporary historical
   fourteen year period from 1988 to 2001. Using treatment effects
   modeling, the impact of debt in impacting the levels of firms' broadband
   deployment has been found to be negative and significant. The primary
   source of debt in the sector has been in the form of arm's-length
   corporate bonds and the assumptions of the monitoring hypothesis
   associated with such debt, that lenders, in the face of information and
   collective actions problems, might not be able to control managers and
   hence invest less in highly technology-intensive situations, are
   supported by the data. Additionally, the data set has been split into
   separate sets for two periods, one between 1988 and 1995, for the period
   before the Telecommunications Act of 1996 came into force, and the other
   set between 1996 and 2001, and the results have stayed consistent. A
   test of the coefficients between the two periods has shown that the
   negative impact of leverage on broadband deployment has become stronger
   after the introduction of competition in the sector, and this has
   suggested that the change in the institutional logics between the two
   periods has been of material impact in influencing lenders' perceptions.

Abstract = {We examined the impact of secret conversation opportunities during
   virtual team discussions on majority opinion holders' motivation to
   attend to minority opinion holders. Studies 1a and b showed that
   majorities were more motivated to process others' arguments when secret
   conversation opportunities were available (vs. not), provided these
   arguments contained unique (vs. shared) information and this information
   was offered by the minority (vs. majority). Study 2 demonstrated that
   this effect occurs because secret opportunities made majorities feel
   less powerful after being exposed to unique information from the
   minority (Study 2a), especially when majority members expected others to
   use these channels (Study 2b). Study 3 used an interactive group
   decision -making task and demonstrated that the increased majority
   motivation triggered by secret opportunities increased group decision
   quality. Study 3 also examined whether secret opportunities influence
   the minority and whether the effect is robust across different
   communication settings. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Inc.},

Abstract = {In this study, we examine the cross-cultural differences in human
   resource (HR) managers' beliefs in effective HR practices by surveying
   HR practitioners in Finland (N = 86), South Korea (N = 147), and Spain
   (N = 196). Similar to previous studies from the United States, the
   Netherlands, and Australia, there are large discrepancies between HR
   practitioner beliefs and research findings, particularly in the area of
   staffing. In addition, we find that interpersonal-oriented aspects of HR
   practices tend to be more culturally bound than technical-oriented
   aspects of HR practices. We interpret the differences using Hofstede's
   cultural dimensions (Power Distance, Individualism versus Collectivism,
   Masculinity versus Femininity, Long-Term Orientation versus Short-Term
   Orientation, and Uncertainty Avoidance). We discuss the overall nature
   of the science-practice gap in HR management, and the implications for
   evidence-based management. (c) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

Journal = {HUMAN RELATIONS},

Abstract = {This article examines the normative expectations freelance jazz
   musicians have about the material conditions of live performance work,
   taking London and Paris as case studies. It shows how price norms
   constitute an important reference point for individual workers in
   navigating the labour market. However, only rarely do they take
   stronger' form as a collective demand. Two further arguments are made:
   first, that the strength of norms varies very widely across labour
   markets, being much stronger on jobs where other qualitative attractions
   (such as the scope for creative autonomy) are weak. Second, in the Paris
   case, an ostensibly solidaristic social insurance mechanism (the
   Intermittence du Spectacle system) had the seemingly paradoxical effect
   of further weakening social norms around working conditions. Workers'
   individual efforts to meet the system's eligibility criteria often
   disrupted the emergence of collective expectations around pricing, and
   in some cases the existence of formal regulation itself was stigmatized
   as stifling creativity.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF APPLIED PSYCHOLOGY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {101},
Number = {3},
Pages = {362-378},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Why and when do employees respond to workplace ostracism by withholding
   their engagement in citizenship behavior? Beyond perspectives proposed
   in past studies, we offer a new account based on a social identity
   perspective and propose that workplace ostracism decreases citizenship
   behavior by undermining employees' identification with the organization.
   We also theorize that perceived job mobility influences the extent to
   which employees identify with the organization when being ostracized.
   These hypotheses were examined in two time-lagged studies conducted in
   China. The proposed hypotheses were supported by results in Study 1, and
   findings were generally replicated in Study 2, where effects of other
   known mediators (i.e., organization-based self-esteem, job engagement,
   and felt obligation toward the organization) and moderators (i.e.,
   collectivism, power distance, and future orientation) suggested by
   previous perspectives were controlled. Results of Study 2 provided
   further support of the hypothesized directional effect of workplace
   ostracism on citizenship behavior via organizational identification. Our
   studies support the identification perspective in understanding
   workplace ostracism and also strengthen the application of this
   perspective in understanding workplace aggression broadly.},

Abstract = {This paper uses an industry case study of technological transition from
   second-generation (2G) to third-generation (3G) networks in China to
   unfold how meso-level factors drove the development of TD-SCDMA, China's
   home-born 3G standard. In this purposive transitional process, under the
   coordination of a central authority, multiple `regime actors'
   (government agencies) engaged in bargaining, negotiation and consensus
   building that determined the developmental directions and outcome of
   TD-SCDMA. TD-SCDMA proved to be a political success but an economic
   failure. The policy implications are profound. In particular, as the
   `silo regulatory model' of policy making which focuses on a single
   industry is gradually replaced by a collective model involving
   interindustry players, issues about how to manage the collective model
   pose a serious challenge to policy makers in China and other emerging
   countries. The paper provides evidence for the importance of meso-level
   factors in the multi level perspective (MLP) framework of sociotechnical
   transitions. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {This paper addresses the operations challenges of effectively managing
   professional services on a global scale. The specific context for the
   study is professional engineering services and particularly those that
   are delivered globally global engineering services (GES). Estimates
   suggest that the market for GES was around US\$930 billion in 2012,
   rising to US\$1.4 trillion by 2020 (ISG, 2013). Yet this influential
   sector receives scant attention in the operations management literature.
   The paper draws on six case studies to explore the operations management
   challenges of delivering GES. In doing so the paper introduces the
   concept of network capabilities for GES, highlighting the centrality
   that: (i) network resources accessing and deploying dispersed resources,
   (ii) network coordination coordinating and integrating network
   activities, and (iii) network learning collective learning and knowledge
   management, all play in enabling the successful operational management

Abstract = {The concept of brand community has been used to understand how consumers
   create value around brands online. Recently consumer researchers have
   begun to debate the relevance of this concept for understanding
   brand-related communication on social media. Based on a data set of 8949
   tweets about Louis Vuitton gathered on Italian Twitter in 2013, this
   article addresses these discussions by developing the alternative
   concept of brand publics that differ from brand communities in three
   important ways. First, brand publics are social formations that are not
   based on interaction but on a continuous focus of interest and
   mediation. Second, participation in brand publics is not structured by
   discussion or deliberation but by individual or collective affect.
   Third, in brand publics consumers do not develop a collective identity
   around the focal brand; rather the brand is valuable as a medium that
   can offer publicity to a multitude of diverse situations of identity.
   The conclusion suggests that brand publics might be part of a social
   media-based consumer culture where publicity rather than identity has
   become a core value.},

Abstract = {Using a large hand-collected database of 605 privatized firms from 48
   countries, we examine the relationship between the collectivism measure
   of culture and residual state ownership in privatized firms. We find
   that the continued role of government in privatized firms is positively
   related to collectivism. This result is robust to using alternative
   measures of collectivism and government control, as well as when we
   address the endogeneity of collectivism. Finally, we examine the
   economic outcomes of culture at the firm level, focusing primarily on
   performance, efficiency, risk-taking, and valuation measures. We report
   that privatized firms with high residual state ownership exhibit lower
   performance, valuation, efficiency, and risk-taking in collectivist
   societies. Our results suggest that formal institutions are not, as
   sustained by previous studies, the main/ exclusive constraints on the
   privatization reform.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ETHICS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {133},
Number = {3},
Pages = {487-498},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The present study examines how collectivism, an important cultural
   value, plays a moderating role in the association between job attitudes
   (job satisfaction and organizational commitment) and actual turnover in
   a sample of 781 Chinese female workers. Results show that collectivism
   moderates the relationships between job attitude variables and turnover
   intention. Job satisfaction and organizational commitment are more
   powerful in predicting turnover intention when levels of collectivism
   are high rather than low. However, collectivism only moderates the
   mediation of turnover intention in the relationship between job
   satisfaction and actual turnover. The study deepens the understanding of
   the moderating effect of cultural values in organizational behavioral
   outcomes as Taras et al. (J Appl Psychol 95:405-439, 2010) suggest. Also
   discussed are the practical implications on how to control the voluntary
   termination of female laborers who constitute an important part in
   Chinese manufacturing.},

Journal = {ACADEMY OF MANAGEMENT JOURNAL},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {59},
Number = {1},

Abstract = {``Best Places to Work{''} (BPTW) and similar competitions are a
   proliferating form of third party employment branding. Little is known,
   however, about how single or repeated third party employment branding
   occurrences relate to key human capital outcomes. Extending signaling
   theory by considering signal credibility and comparability, we use
   archival and survey data from 624 BPTW participants in 16 competitions
   across a three year period,to develop and test hypotheses linking BPTW
   certifications to collective turnover rates and key informant
   perceptions of applicant pool quality. We find that certifications are
   associated with lower turnover rates, and in addition, propose competing
   crystallization and celebrity hypotheses that model turnover
   trajectories with repeated certifications, finding diminishing marginal
   turnover reductions across multiple certifications. We also examine
   company size and industry job opening moderators, finding that as
   certifications increase, applicant pool quality is: (1) higher in
   smaller companies, and (2) higher when job openings are scarcer.
   Finally, beyond being certified or not, we find supplemental evidence
   for effects of the specific certification level achieved (e.g., 2nd
   versus 15th). This investigation advances theory related to collective
   turnover, applicant pool quality, and employment branding, and is
   relevant to company decisions about seeking or re-seeking third party
   certifications.},

Abstract = {We propose that employees' perceptions of intra-organizational cues are
   an important factor influencing their identification with their
   organizations. Building on self-categorization theory, we examine
   whether perceived organizational support influences organizational
   identification. We contend that in addition to the mediating effect of
   affective commitment, organizational identification also mediates the
   effect of perceived organizational support on employees' extra-role
   behavior. We collect perceptions of perceived organizational support,
   organizational identification and extra-role behavior information from
   363 nurses in China using a three-wave data collection method and find
   empirical evidence to support most of our hypotheses. We find that
   collectivism moderates the indirect effect of perceived organizational
   support on extra-role behavior through organizational identification. We
   discuss the implications of our findings.},

Abstract = {This research documents ``the friendly taking effect{''} in choosing

   leads to a preference for a self-benefiting package when this package
   also offers greater total benefit to the self-other collective (studies

   total benefit) underlies the friendly taking effect; therefore, people
   both take more from and give more to a close (vs. distant) other when
   doing so offers greater benefits in total (study 3), and people are
   cognitively tuned in to (e.g., acquire, remember) information about the
   total benefit more when choosing a package for themselves and a close
   (vs. distant) other (study 4). Moreover, the importance people place on
   the total benefit mediates the impact of closeness on people's
   preference for self-benefiting packages (study 5). We explore boundary
   conditions (study 6) and implications for marketers of consumption
   packages (study 7).},

Title = {Not As Smart As We Think: A Study of Collective Intelligence in Virtual
   Groups},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEMS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {33},
Number = {3},
Pages = {684-712},
Abstract = {Organizations increasingly use virtual groups for many types of work,
   yet little research has examined factors that make groups perform better
   across multiple different types of tasks. Previous research has proposed
   that groups, like individuals, have a general factor of collective
   intelligence, an ability to perform consistently across multiple types
   of tasks. We studied groups that used computer-mediated communication
   (CMC) to investigate whether collective intelligence is similar or
   different when groups work using CMC. A collective intelligence factor
   did not emerge among groups using CMC, suggesting that collective
   intelligence manifests itself differently depending on context. This is
   in contrast to previous findings. Our results surface a need for more
   research on boundary conditions of the construct of collective
   intelligence. Our findings also have practical implications: managers
   should take care when organizing virtual group work because groups that
   perform well on one type of task will not necessarily be the groups that
   do well on other tasks},

Title = {A stake in the fight: When do heterosexual employees resist
   organizational policies that deny marriage equality to LGB peers?},
Journal = {ORGANIZATIONAL BEHAVIOR AND HUMAN DECISION PROCESSES},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {132},
Pages = {1-15},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Many organizations in the United States have articulated positions to
   support or oppose marriage equality for LGB individuals. To date,
   minimal research has considered how employees react to these positions,
   and none has considered the conditions that encourage heterosexual
   employees to stand in solidarity with LGB peers in favor of equal
   treatment. Two experiments grounded in social identity theory, the
   social identity model of collective action, and intergroup emotions
   theory examine these processes. Study 1 found that heterosexual
   employees' intentions to neglect work, quit, and engage in other acts of
   resistance in response to organizational marriage equality positions are
   highly contingent on identification with the LGB community. Study 2
   replicated this pattern of results and found that this interaction was
   additionally contingent on identification with the organization itself.
   Further, the effects of the three-way interaction on behavioral
   intentions were fully mediated by the emotional experience of moral
   outrage. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Year = {2016},
Volume = {53},
Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {55-88},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Scholars increasingly recognize that organizational fields contain
   minority identities, linked to alternative logics. Extant work has been
   largely silent on how such minority identities are maintained, and what
   their implications are for organizational agency. I contribute to
   filling this gap by examining how organizations cultivate minority
   identities, and how such identities both enable and constrain agency.
   Employing the foreignness of multinational enterprise subsidiaries as a
   particular case of minority identity, I find that managers actively
   cultivate minority identities by embedding into niche networks,
   reinforcing alternative expectations, and categorizing themselves into
   distinct collective identities. These elements of the minority identity
   enable particular forms of agency - internal experimentation and an
   external license to deviate - while constraining others - adaptation to
   the dominant logic and positioning in mature market segments. The
   findings extend theory by highlighting how minority identities are
   generated and sustained, as well as their implications for agency.},

Title = {Blind loyalty? When group loyalty makes us see evil or engage in it},
Journal = {ORGANIZATIONAL BEHAVIOR AND HUMAN DECISION PROCESSES},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {132},
Pages = {16-36},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Loyalty often drives corruption. Corporate scandals, political
   machinations, and sports cheating highlight how loyalty's pernicious
   nature manifests in collusion, conspiracy, cronyism, nepotism, and other
   forms of cheating. Yet loyalty is also touted as an ethical principle
   that guides behavior. Drawing on moral psychology and behavioral ethics
   research, we developed hypotheses about when group loyalty fosters
   ethical behavior and when it fosters corruption. Across nine studies, we
   found that individuals primed with loyalty cheated less than those not
   primed (Study 1A and 1B). Members more loyal to their fraternities
   (Study 2A) and students more loyal to their study groups (Study 2B) also
   cheated less than their less loyal counterparts due to greater ethical
   salience when they pledged their loyalty (Studies 3A and 3B).
   Importantly, competition moderated these effects: when competition was
   high, members more loyal to their fraternities (Study 4) or individuals
   primed with loyalty (Studies 5A and 5B) cheated more. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Year = {2016},
Volume = {101},

Abstract = {Studies of innovative behavior (the generation, dissemination, and
   implementation of new ideas) have generally overlooked the agency
   perspective on this important type of performance behavior. Guided by
   social-cognitive theory, we propose a moderated mediation relationship
   to explain why and how employees become motivated to make things happen
   through their innovative endeavors. First, we propose that
   within-individual increases in organizational trust and perceived
   respect by colleagues promote within-individual increases in creative,
   persuasion, and change self-efficacy over time. Second, we propose that
   within-individual increases in self-efficacy beliefs promote
   within-individual increases in idea generation, dissemination, and
   implementation over time. Finally, we propose that psychological
   collectivism (a between-individual variable) is a moderator, and that a
   higher level of psychological collectivism weakens the positive
   relationship between within-individual increases in self-efficacy
   beliefs and within-individual increases in innovative behavior. Repeated
   measures collected from 267 employees in Italy at 3 time points over an
   8-month period generally support our proposed dynamic moderated
   mediation relationship.},

   resource sharing will be more often based on reciprocity and trust.
   Hence, we hypothesized that networks will be more beneficial in
   individual contexts compared with collectivistic context. We found

   social production systems develop a collective governance capability to
   steer the process of integrating distributed knowledge resources to the
   production of value. Governance mechanisms emerge from individual and
   collective learning that is made possible by new technology, and they
   evolve over time, as routines are developed to respond to new problems
   faced by a growing production system. Using Wikipedia as a paradigmatic
   example of online social production, we characterize governance as an
   evolving, enabling and embedded process and discuss implications for a
   dynamic theory of governance.},

Title = {Can Payment-per-Click Induce Improvements in Click Fraud Identification
   Technologies?},
Journal = {INFORMATION SYSTEMS RESEARCH},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {26},
Number = {4},
Pages = {754-772},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Pay-per-click (PPC) is a common pricing model used to pay for ads on the
   Web and is open to the possibility for click fraud, where clicks are not
   from a legitimate user. Identifying click fraud is generally done in a
   three-stage process: the service provider (SP) first classifies clicks
   as fraudulent or not, then the advertiser does the same with a different
   technology, and if there is a disagreement, the SP examines further and
   his conclusions are considered binding. The advertiser pays for clicks
   that are identified as valid in the first two stages or confirmed as
   valid in the last stage. We model the choice of the identification
   technologies as a double moral hazard problem. We analyze the case where
   the PPC is incentive compatible to overcome the moral hazard problem,
   and examine the question of whether the incentive compatible PPC is
   sufficient to incentivize the two parties to unilaterally make further
   improvements to their identification technologies and simultaneously
   increase their profits. We show that when the cost of the third-stage
   identification technology is large, which is likely to be the case
   because of its complexity and use of expensive human experts, the
   incentive compatible PPC does not support unilateral technological
   improvements. We then examine a setting where the third-stage
   identification is delegated to a third party and find that this
   arrangement can induce unilateral improvements to the identification
   technologies in the first two stages. Collectively our results show that
   although the PPC model itself may not induce improvements in the first
   two stages of click fraud identification, a common arrangement espoused
   of having a third party resolve disagreements helps make PPC support
   unilateral technological improvements. Accordingly, we show an indirect
   benefit to the third-party arrangement.},

Abstract = {This paper examines how fluid social collectives, where membership is
   latent, contested, or unclear, achieve organizationality', that is, how
   they achieve organizational identity and actorhood. Drawing on the
   communicative constitution of organizations perspective, we argue that
   the organizationality of a social collective is accomplished through
   identity claims' - i.e., speech acts that concern what the social
   collective is or does - and negotiations on whether or not these claims
   have been made on the collective's behalf. We empirically examine the
   case of the hacker collective Anonymous and analyse relevant identity
   claims to investigate two critical episodes in which the
   organizationality of Anonymous was contested. Our study contributes to
   organization studies by showing that fluid social collectives are able
   to temporarily reinstate organizational actorhood through the
   performance of carefully prepared and staged identity claims.},

Abstract = {In their endeavor to establish new products and services, entrepreneurs
   can face strong resistance from market incumbents whose resources and
   market position they threaten. This paper looks at the battles between
   entrepreneurs and market incumbents in a regulated market where various
   institutional actors (e.g., regulators, courts) have the power to
   protect the incumbents by hindering the entrepreneurs. Our comparison of
   one failed and one successful attempt to introduce pay TV in the U.S.
   reveals how entrepreneurs can first enter a regulated market without
   facing resistance, and then introduce a new frame to legitimize their
   product or service despite growing resistance from incumbents. Our
   framework highlights framing as a strategy and framing contests as a
   mechanism through which entrepreneurs and incumbents can battle to
   enable or disable institutional change. As part of this process, we also
   uncover how entrepreneurs evolve from self-serving actors with no
   field-level intentions to powerful groups that create a ripple effect in
   their environment by moving their target of influence from private to
   institutional actors. Our work constitutes a step toward a more
   ``realistic{''} tale of institutional change.},

   Role of a Proactive Commitment to Innovation},
Journal = {HUMAN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {54},
Number = {1, SI},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Organizational research suggests that ambidexterity is attainable if top
   managers cultivate collective behavioral routines that enable them to
   synthesize large amounts of information and decision alternatives, and
   manage conflict and ambiguity. However, the type of information and
   knowledge sources that enable top managers to meet the knowledge demands
   of ambidexterity remains poorly understood. Toward that end, we argue
   that the extensiveness of top managers' social networks inside and
   outside the firm, on an integrative basis, can offer the dual knowledge
   benefits conducive to ambidexterity. Because ambidexterity entails the
   firm's departure from existing products, technologies, and practices, we
   further argue that the contribution of extensive networks to
   ambidexterity is conditional upon the collective volition of top
   managers to parlay extensive network opportunities into innovative
   pursuits. From a study of CEOs and top management teams in SMEs
   operating in technology-based industries, we find support for both a
   network extensiveness effect and the moderating role of a proactive
   commitment to innovation in shaping this effect. (c) 2015 Wiley

Abstract = {This study examines the persistence and economic consequences of
   variations in reporting style across audit partners in individual
   engagements. Our results show that both aggressive and conservative
   audit reporting, measured by the pattern of prior Type 2 and Type 1
   audit reporting error rates in auditor-specific clienteles, persist over
   time and extend to other clients of the same partner. Analyses of
   abnormal accruals and persistence of client firms' accrual estimates
   corroborate this finding, and hold both for private and publicly listed
   companies. Further, our results also show that the market penalizes
   client firms susceptible to aggressive audit partner reporting
   decisions. In particular, we find that our proxies for aggressive audit
   reporting are related to higher interest rates, worse credit ratings and
   less favorable forecasts of insolvency for private client companies, and
   a lower Tobin's Q for publicly listed client companies. Collectively,
   these results imply that audit partner aggressive or conservative
   reporting is a systematic audit partner attribute and not randomly
   distributed across engagements.},

Abstract = {International business (IB) research has predominantly relied on value
   constructs to account for the influence of societal culture, notably
   Hofstede's cultural dimensions. While parsimonious, the value approach's
   assumptions about the consensus of values within nations, and the
   generality and stability of cultural patterns of behavior are
   increasingly challenged. We review two promising alternatives the
   constructivist approach centering on schemas and the intersubjectivist
   approach centering on norms and the evidence that demonstrates their
   usefulness in accounting for international differences in the behavior
   of managers, employees, and consumers. We propose a situated dynamics
   framework, specifying the role of values, schemas, and norms in
   accounting for cultural differences, and delineating conditions under
   which each causal mechanism is operative. Values play a more important
   role in accounting for cultural differences in weak situations where
   fewer constraints are perceived; schemas play a more important role when
   situational cues increase their accessibility and relevance; and norms
   play a more important role when social evaluation is salient. Directions
   for future research based on this integrative framework and its
   implications for the measurement of culture and application in IB are
   discussed.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF FINANCIAL ECONOMICS},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {118},
Number = {3},
Pages = {553-570},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Financing terms and investment decisions are jointly determined. This
   interdependence, which links firms' asset and liability sides, can lead
   to short-termism in investment. In our model, financing frictions
   increase with the investment horizon, such that financing for long-term
   projects is relatively expensive and potentially rationed. In response,
   firms whose first-best investments are long-term may adopt second-best
   projects of shorter maturities. This worsens financing terms for firms
   with shorter-maturity projects, inducing them to change their
   investments as well. In equilibrium, investment is inefficiently
   short-term. Equilibrium asset-side adjustments by firms can amplify
   shocks and, while privately optimal, can be socially undesirable. (C)

Abstract = {In this article, I draw from the culture-centered approach to explore
   contemporary negotiations of career and work, positing career as a form
   of cultural practice. Rooted in postcolonial theory and subaltern
   studies, the culture-centered approach examines the active
   accomplishment of culture through everyday communicative practices,
   amidst the structural conditions that frame lived experiences, and
   focusing specifically on marginalized groups. I first trace how culture
   is conceptualized in extant career studies, in the psychological,
   sociological and communicative streams. Identifying both key gaps and
   paradoxes in the literature, I outline the culture-centered approach,
   suggesting four key principles to reconceive career as cultural
   practice. Specifically: career draws on both structure and action;
   career agency is hybridized across individuals/collectives; career
   agency is layered and contested; and career is both discursive and
   material. The framework is illustrated using an example from an ongoing
   study on the negotiation of subsistence careers by Native Alaskans in
   the US Arctic.},

Title = {What Motivates Contributors vs. Lurkers? An Investigation of Online
   Feedback Forums},
Journal = {INFORMATION SYSTEMS RESEARCH},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {26},
Number = {4},
Pages = {773-792},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Organizations are setting up online forums to obtain inputs and feedback
   from key stakeholders, such as employees, customers, and citizens.
   Examples of such virtual spaces are online policy deliberation forums
   (OPDFs) initiated by government organizations to garner citizens' views
   on policy issues. Incorporating the inputs from these forums can result
   in more inclusive policies for societal benefit. Yet, as with other such
   forums, a common issue facing OPDFs is the sustainability of
   participation. When examining this issue, previous research has mostly
   explored the participation antecedents of existing contributors.
   However, engaging lurkers is also important, because these forums need
   to compensate for contributor attrition and become more effective with
   greater reach. Thus motivated, this study develops a model to explain
   the antecedents of both contributors' and lurkers' participation
   deriving from public participation and information technology-enabled
   public goods theories. It hypothesizes differences in the antecedents
   for contributors versus lurkers based primarily on construal level
   theory. The model was empirically validated through a survey of
   contributors and lurkers in a nationwide OPDF. The results reveal
   significant differences in the participation antecedents of the two
   groups as hypothesized. Specifically, contributors are influenced by
   political career benefit and political efficacy motives, whereas
   lurkers' future participation intention is driven by collective
   benefits, possession of civic skills, and mobilization. Furthermore,
   perceived connectivity of the OPDF directly influences participation
   intention for contributors and indirectly impacts participation
   intention for both groups via perceived communality. Perceived
   communality, on the other hand, influences collective and persuasion
   benefits for both contributors and lurkers. These findings are useful
   for understanding and promoting participation through differential
   strategies for contributors and lurkers in OPDFs in particular, and by
   extension, other feedback or online forums.},

Abstract = {This paper explores how large-scale social-driven collaborations might
   grow in scale and help promote political change. We present the results
   of a qualitative investigation of a complex platform where multiple and
   hybrid collaborations co-exist and where civil society plays a central
   role. Based on a longitudinal comparative case study, we draw a
   processual model describing micro-practices and pathways of engagement.
   We show that the emergence of these collaborations requires a new type
   of convener, one that is able to manage the interplay between the
   sharing/co-creation of abundant resources and the coordinated
   decentralization of informal authority. Our study extends existing
   debates on the role of resources and authority, showing the
   complementarity between possession and practice perspectives of power.
   Finally, we identified synergies between collaboration and social
   movement literatures, particularly showing that large-scale
   collaborations could be mobilized to refine social movement agendas and
   achieve more purposive collective action.},

Abstract = {Most research on culture in international business either aggregates
   people within a country into a single, homogeneous, national culture, or
   examines heterogeneity within countries based on exogenous criteria. In
   this study, we explore heterogeneity in cultural values within and
   across countries endogenously through the configurations of values
   people share in common. We develop a theory of culture archetypes and
   use a novel methodology that identifies a small number of distinct
   configurations of values archetypes in our data. These data come from
   the World Values Survey 2005 and Schwartz's model of culture. We
   identify four culture archetypes in Japan, USA and China, and six in
   India. The existence of transnational and subnational archetypes across
   the four countries suggests the need to recognize culture as a
   combination of universal etic - as well as unique - emic -
   characteristics. Our approach also distinguishes between those
   individuals represented by our archetypes and those individuals who more
   closely resemble the average values of a country. By unifying both
   archetypes and national averages within one theoretical and
   methodological schema we thus reconcile the conflicting perspectives in
   the field.},

Abstract = {Territorial marking allows people to communicate that a territory has
   been claimed. Across 2 studies, we examine the impact of territorial
   marking of one's ideas on others' invited creativity when asked to
   provide feedback. Integrating research on territoriality and
   self-construal, we examine the effect of control-oriented marking on
   invited creativity (Study 1), and the extent to which an independent
   versus interdependent self-construal moderates this effect (Study 2).
   Results of Study 1 demonstrate that the use of control-oriented marking
   to communicate a territorial claim over one's ideas inhibits invited
   creativity, and this effect is mediated by intrinsic motivation. Also
   consistent with our hypotheses, the results of Study 2 show that
   self-construal moderates the effect of control-oriented marking on
   others' intrinsic motivation and creativity. Marking diminishes invited
   creativity among people with an independent self-construal but serves to
   enhance the creativity of those with an interdependent self-construal.
   Consistent with Study 1, intrinsic motivation mediates this moderated
   effect. Our results highlight the important but heretofore understudied
   role of territoriality in affecting others' creativity as well as the
   role of independent versus interdependent self-construal in shaping this
   effect.},

Title = {Structural Interdependence in Teams: An Integrative Framework and

Journal = {JOURNAL OF APPLIED PSYCHOLOGY},

Volume = {100},
Number = {6},
Pages = {1825-1846},

Abstract = {Although interdependence is a central aspect of team design, there has
   been a lack of clarity regarding the meaning and impact of different
   forms of interdependence. To provide theoretical clarity and to advance
   research on team interdependence, we develop an organizing, conceptual
   framework of interdependence in teams and test it using meta-analysis.
   We first review and tie together different conceptualizations of
   interdependence in the literature and illustrate how they converge
   around 2 major constructs: task interdependence and outcome
   interdependence. After providing integrative definitions of these forms
   of interdependence, as well as subdimensions, we then explore the
   relative effects of task and outcome interdependence on team functioning
   and performance. Specifically, we propose a pattern of differential
   effects in which task interdependence is primarily associated with team
   performance through its effects on task-focused team functioning (i.e.,
   transition/action processes, collective efficacy), whereas outcome
   interdependence is primarily associated with team performance through
   its effects on relational team functioning (i.e., interpersonal
   processes, cohesion). We test these differential effects using a
   meta-analytic database of 107 independent samples and 7,563 teams. The
   meta-analytic path model provides strong support for our hypotheses.
   Implications and future directions for the study of interdependence in
   work teams are discussed.},

Abstract = {This paper develops a generalized Roy model with human capital
   accumulation, moral hazard, and career concerns. We identify and
   estimate the model with a large panel that matches data on publicly
   listed firms to information on their executives. The structural
   estimates obtained are used to decompose the firm-size pay gap. We find
   that although total compensation and incentive pay increase with firm
   size, certainty-equivalent pay decreases with firm size. In larger
   firms, and for more highly ranked executives, weaker signal quality
   about effort results in higher risk premiums. This risk premium accounts
   for roughly 80 percent of the firm-size gap in total compensation.
   Larger firms are also willing to pay more than smaller ones to attract
   executives. Finally, the estimated coefficients on human capital
   accumulation from formal education and experience gained from different
   firms are individually significant, but their collective effect on
   firm-size pay differentials nets out.},

Abstract = {Twenty-five large field experiments with major U.S. retailers and
   brokerages, most reaching millions of customers and collectively
   representing \$2.8 million in digital advertising expenditure, reveal
   that measuring the returns to advertising is difficult. The median
   confidence interval on return on investment is over 100 percentage
   points wide. Detailed sales data show that relative to the per capita
   cost of the advertising, individual-level sales are very volatile; a
   coefficient of variation of 10 is common. Hence, informative advertising
   experiments can easily require more than 10 million person-weeks, making
   experiments costly and potentially infeasible for many firms. Despite
   these unfavorable economics, randomized control trials represent
   progress by injecting new, unbiased information into the market. The
   inference challenges revealed in the field experiments also show that
   selection bias, due to the targeted nature of advertising, is a
   crippling concern for widely employed observational methods.},

Abstract = {Little is known about how discrimination manifests before individuals
   formally apply to organizations or how it varies within and between
   organizations. We address this knowledge gap through an audit study in
   academia of over 6,500 professors at top U. S. universities drawn from
   89 disciplines and 259 institutions. In our experiment, professors were
   contacted by fictional prospective students seeking to discuss research
   opportunities prior to applying to a doctoral program. Names of students
   were randomly assigned to signal gender and race (White, Black,
   Hispanic, Indian, Chinese), but messages were otherwise identical. We
   hypothesized that discrimination would appear at the informal
   ``pathway{''} preceding entry to academia and would vary by discipline
   and university as a function of faculty representation and pay. We found
   that when considering requests from prospective students seeking
   mentoring in the future, faculty were significantly more responsive to
   White males than to all other categories of students, collectively,
   particularly in higher-paying disciplines and private institutions.
   Counterintuitively, the representation of women and minorities and
   discrimination were uncorrelated, a finding that suggests greater
   representation cannot be assumed to reduce discrimination. This research
   highlights the importance of studying decisions made before formal entry
   points into organizations and reveals that discrimination is not evenly
   distributed within and between organizations.},

Abstract = {This article is concerned with developing an understanding of the
   careers of women managers in China. Existing literature suggests that
   while women in China are comparatively well represented in management
   roles, they face distinctive pressures and barriers to their progress
   arising from entrenched patriarchal and collectivist aspects of the
   Chinese cultural tradition. However, little is known about how these
   aspects impact on women's orientations towards their careers and to what
   extent influential Western career theories are adequate in interpreting
   their experience. Drawing on interviews with 20 women managers in China,
   the article interprets women's orientations towards their careers in
   relation to their adherence to traditional gender roles and collectivist
   values. Using this framework, a fourfold taxonomy is developed which
   identifies ``conformist,{''} ``revolutionary,{''} ``soloist,{''} and
   ``dissident{''} orientations. The article suggests that Western career
   theories fail to capture the collective dimension, and thus do not
   account fully for the range of experience and orientations of Chinese
   women managers that are captured in the taxonomy. Implications, both
   practical and theoretical, are discussed. Recommendations are also made
   as to how management and career development policies might be developed
   in organizations in China in order to address the diverse needs and
   preferences of women managers. (C) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

Abstract = {Entrepreneurial orientation (EO)a firm's strategic posture towards
   entrepreneurshiphas become the predominant construct of interest in
   strategic entrepreneurship research. Despite the ever-increasing volume
   of nomological research on EO, there remain ongoing conversations
   regarding its ontology. Drawing from measurement theory, we outline an
   EO reconceptualization addressing the likely prevalence of Type II
   nomological error in the EO literature stemming from measurement model
   misspecification. Focusing on the question of whether EO is an
   attitudinal construct, a behavioral construct, or both, we propose a
   formative construction of EO viewing the exhibition of entrepreneurial
   behaviors and of managerial attitude towards risk as jointly necessary
   dimensions that collectively form the higher-order EO construct. We
   present an empirical illustration of our reconceptualization followed by
   a discussion of future research opportunities. Copyright (c) 2014 John

Title = {The effect of alternative accounting measurement bases on investors'

Journal = {ACCOUNTING ORGANIZATIONS AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {46},
Number = {SI},
Pages = {100-114},

Abstract = {We conduct a laboratory experiment to examine investors' assessments of
   managers' stewardship. We provide evidence that investors tend to
   attribute external (i.e., non-manager-related) causes of firm
   performance to managers' performance. We predict and find that fair
   value information enables investors to overcome this tendency and make
   better stewardship decisions than investors with amortized cost
   information. We also find that investors presented with
   amortized-cost-based financial statements perform better to the extent
   they access fair-value-based footnote information, while investors
   presented with fair-value-based financial statements perform worse to
   the extent they access amortized-cost-based footnote information.
   Collectively, our results suggest that investors' stewardship decisions
   are improved because fair value information more transparently provides
   the information required to properly consider the opportunity costs
   associated with managers' actions and disentangle endogenous actions by
   managers from exogenous market forces that are outside of managers'
   control. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

   (collectively, SOX) as natural experiments, to examine whether board
   independence improves decision making by overconfident CEOs. The results
   are strongly supportive: after SOX, overconfident CEOs reduce investment
   and risk exposure, increase dividends, improve postacquisition
   performance, and have better operating performance and market value.
   Importantly, these changes are absent for overconfident-CEO firms that
   were compliant prior to SOX.},

Volume = {40},
Number = {4},

Abstract = {Boundary-spanning employees can have a substantial impact on
   organizational performance based on the relationships they build with
   external stakeholders. Yet there is currently no theoretical lens
   through which to understand the nature of-and psychological contributors
   to these employee-stakeholder relationships at the individual level.
   Drawing on social identity theory, the proposed framework reveals that
   when an employee identifies strongly with the organization, this affects
   the way the employee views external stakeholders in the social landscape
   at work, resulting in some surprising consequences. Specifically, when
   organizational identification is heightened, an employee's engagement
   with external stakeholders will paradoxically become more adversarial
   and less collaborative. This effect can be attenuated, or even reversed,
   to the extent that (a) the employee construes that the stakeholder is an
   organizational member and (b) the organization's identity orientation is
   collectivistic. The proposed framework also reveals antecedents to an
   employee's construal of a stakeholder's membership in the organization
   antecedents that are unique to the boundary-spanning context.},

Abstract = {While the study of lying within organizations typically has focused on
   lies told for rational-instrumental purposes (such as lying for economic
   gain within negotiations), we argue that lying is a relatively common
   social-functional behavior embedded within ongoing workplace
   relationships. Drawing from social identity theory, we develop a theory
   of lying as a socially motivated behavioral response to identity threats
   at the personal, relational, or collective levels of identity in
   organizational life. Specifically, we propose that perceived identity
   threats undermine the unique fundamental identity motives at each level
   of self, and that as threat sensitivity and threat intractability
   increase, individuals become more likely to use lying as a threat
   management response in their interactions with other organizational
   members. Further, we propose that identity-based characteristics of
   organizational members with whom threatened individuals interact (i.e.,
   the audience) determine the likelihood that lying will occur by
   assuaging or amplifying threats during identity enactment. Thus, by
   applying an identity lens to examine normatively unethical behavior, we
   develop a comprehensive model of everyday lying as socially motivated
   and identity-based behavior with implications for ongoing workplace
   relationships.},

Abstract = {Pioneers in emerging scientific and technology fields face liabilities
   of newness at both individual and collective levels. Insights from the
   literature of institutional entrepreneurship and sociology of knowledge
   suggest that, to overcome this double hurdle, early entrants may want to
   participate in a field's hot center and connect their ideas to multiple
   existing fields to broaden their audience. However, these strategies
   have their drawbacks too, and the payoff of these strategies also
   decreases as a field gains cognitive legitimacy. Moreover, both the
   positive and negative effects of these mobilization strategies are more
   pronounced for less-experienced scientists. Findings from a
   comprehensive database on grant proposals in the emerging field of
   nanotechnology confirm these propositions, suggesting that an effective
   mobilization strategy is a balancing act between isomorphism and
   differentiation, breadth and boundary maintenance, especially in early
   stages of field development. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {This study investigates the use of audit evidence documentation
   instructions that promote the collection and processing of evidence with
   high-level construals (broad, abstract interpretations of the evidence).
   Abstraction can help a person piece together individual pieces of
   information or evidence and better enable a person to see the big
   picture of what the collective information portends. The results of an
   experiment suggest that auditors think and act with more professional
   skepticism when using the documentation instructions that promote
   high-level construals as compared with auditors using documentation
   instructions promoting low-level construals (specific, detailed
   interpretations of the evidence, akin to current audit practice) and
   with auditors not given documentation instructions. Further, the
   highlevel construals foster better processing of the collected evidence.
   The study also provides preliminary evidence that task complexity could
   interfere with professional skepticism. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

   of quality of country-level governance infrastructure and corporate
   governance effectiveness on profit shifting. We empirically test
   propositions derived from the model with a unique firm-level data set
   and using multiple indicators of governance infrastructure quality and
   corporate governance mechanisms. We estimate that on average about 6\%
   of total pre-tax income is shifted out of foreign-owned firms in India.
   We show that governance infrastructure that improves collective action
   and transparency in both the foreign-and host-country reduces shifting.
   On the other hand, secure property rights and efficient contracting in
   the foreign country increases shifting. We also find that monitoring by
   foreign institutional investors restricts shifting.},

Title = {Dominant Consumption Rituals and Intragroup Boundary Work: How
   Non-Celebrants Manage Conflicting Relational and Identity Goals},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {42},
Number = {3},
Pages = {378-400},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Through collective engagement in consumption rituals, group members
   reinforce intragroup relationships and the boundaries of the group. Yet,
   paradoxically, as intragroup diversity increases, dominant rituals
   deployed for this relational work, can run counter to the ideologically
   rooted identities of some members. Using a sociological lens, this
   article focuses on the complexities of not celebrating a dominant
   collective consumption ritual by focusing on people who do not celebrate
   Christmas in America. The qualitative data analysis finds that
   non-celebrants use a set of ritual strategies that are grounded in their
   conflicting goals of protecting their ideologically rooted identities
   but also doing relational work with celebrators. It shows how
   non-celebrants deploy consumptive elements of the dominant ritual as
   symbolic resources to enact each strategy, foregrounding or
   backgrounding the symbolic boundary between themselves and celebrators.
   Beyond the context, contributions to the study of symbolic boundaries,
   identity politics, and collective consumption rituals are discussed.},

Journal = {ECONOMETRICA},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {83},
Number = {5},
Pages = {2001-2041},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {We propose a method to set identify bounds on the sharing rule for a
   general collective household consumption model. Unlike the effects of
   distribution factors, the level of the sharing rule cannot be uniquely
   identified without strong assumptions on preferences across households.
   Our new results show that, though not point identified without these
   assumptions, strong bounds on the sharing rule can be obtained. We get
   these bounds by applying revealed preference restrictions implied by the
   collective model to the household's continuous aggregate demand
   functions. We obtain informative bounds even if nothing is known about
   whether each good is public, private, or assignable within the
   household, though having such information tightens the bounds. We apply
   our method to US PSID data, obtaining narrow bounds that yield useful
   conclusions regarding the effects of income and wages on intrahousehold
   resource sharing, and on the prevalence of individual (as opposed to
   household level) poverty.},

Abstract = {We examined the relationships between the Five-Factor Model (FFM) of
   personality traits and three forms of organizational commitment
   (affective, normative, and continuance commitment) and their variability

   results based on 55 independent samples from 50 studies (N = 18,262)
   revealed that (a) all FFM traits had positive relationships with
   affective commitment; (b) all FFM traits had positive relationships with
   normative commitment; and (c) Emotional Stability, Extraversion, and
   Openness to Experience had negative relationships with continuance
   commitment. In particular, Agreeableness was found to be the trait most
   strongly related to both affective and normative commitment. The results
   also showed that Agreeableness had stronger relationships with affective
   and normative commitment in collectivistic cultures than in
   individualistic cultures. We provide theoretical and practical
   implications of these findings for personality, job attitudes, and

Journal = {ORGANIZATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {26},
Number = {5},
Pages = {1263-1283},
Month = {SEP-OCT},
Abstract = {We propose a cognitively plausible formal model of collective
   interpretation. The model represents how members of a collective
   interact to interpret their environment. Current theories of collective
   interpretation focus on how heedful communication among members of a
   collective (i.e., how much individuals pay attention to others'
   interpretations) improves interpretive performance; their general
   assumption is that heed tends to be uniformly beneficial. By unpacking
   the micromechanisms that underlie such performance, our model reveals a
   more complex story. Heedfulness can benefit interpretive performance. It
   can help collectives properly interpret situations that are especially
   ambiguous, unknown, or novel. Conversely, heedfulness also generates
   conformity pressures that induce agents to give too much weight to
   others' interpretations, even if erroneous, thereby potentially
   degrading interpretive performance. These two effects join into a
   nonmonotonic trajectory that represents how heed relates to interpretive
   performance: due to its beneficial properties, performance increases
   with heed until it peaks before degrading due to conformity pressures.
   The form of this nonmonotonic relationship is contingent on the nature
   of the task: ambiguous situations make collectives vulnerable to too
   much heed: ambiguity ignites conformism; novel situations make
   collectives dependent on heed: novelty requires multiple eyes to be
   seen. In addition to these results, our model offers a flexible platform
   that future work can use to explore collective interpretation in a
   variety of organizational and supraorganizational contexts.},

Title = {Sustainable evaluation and verification in supply chains: Aligning and
   leveraging accountability to stakeholders},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {38},
Pages = {1-13},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Managers are being challenged by multiple (and diverse) stakeholders,
   which have variety of expectations and informational needs about their
   firm's supply chains. Collectively, these expectations and needs form a
   multi-faceted view of stakeholder accountability, namely the extent to
   which a firm justifies behaviors and actions across its extended supply
   chain to stakeholders. To date, sustainable supply chain management
   research has largely focused on monitoring as a self-managed set of
   narrowly defined evaluative activities employed by firms to provide
   stakeholder accountability. Nevertheless, evidence is emerging that
   firms have developed a wide variety of monitoring systems in order to
   align with stakeholders' expectations and leverage accountability to
   stakeholders. Drawing from the accounting literature, we synthesize a
   model that proposes how firms might address accountability for
   sustainability issues in their supply chain. At its core, the construct
   of sustainable evaluation and verification (SEV) captures three
   interrelated dimensions: inclusivity, scope, and disclosure. These
   dimensions characterize how supply chain processes might identify key
   measures, collect and process data, and finally, verify materiality,
   reliability and accuracy of any data and resulting information. As a
   result, the concept of monitoring is significantly extended, while also
   considering how different stakeholders can play diverse, active roles as
   metrics are established, audits are conducted, and information is
   validated. Also, several antecedents of SEV systems are explored.
   Finally, the means by which an SEV system can create a competitive
   advantage are investigated. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {To address concerns of opportunism, outsourcing firms are encouraged to
   deploy contractual and relational governance. The individual and
   collective effects of these mechanisms have been previously examined but
   not in specific contexts. This study examines the effects of contractual
   and relational governance on provider opportunism, incorporating the
   moderating influence of a shift parameternational culture. Our results
   reveal that contractual governance is more effective in individualistic
   and low uncertainty avoidance cultures. Relational governance is more
   effective in collectivist and high uncertainty avoidance societies. The
   individualism-collectivism dimension also moderates the joint effect of
   these mechanisms. While the mechanisms are generally complementary in
   mitigating opportunism, a singular focus on either contractual or
   relational can be just as effective under situations of high
   individualism and collectivism, respectively. Copyright (c) 2014 John

Title = {The Interplay of Diversity Training and Diversity Beliefs on Team
   Creativity in Nationality Diverse Teams},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF APPLIED PSYCHOLOGY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {100},
Number = {5},
Pages = {1456-1467},

Abstract = {Attaining value from nationality diversity requires active diversity
   management, which organizations often employ in the form of diversity
   training programs. Interestingly, however, the previously reported
   effects of diversity training are often weak and, sometimes, even
   negative. This situation calls for research on the conditions under
   which diversity training helps or harms teams. We propose that diversity
   training can increase team creativity, but only for teams with less
   positive pretraining diversity beliefs (i. e., teams with a greater need
   for such training) and that are sufficiently diverse in nationality.
   Comparing the creativity of teams that attended nationality diversity
   training versus control training, we found that for teams with less
   positive diversity beliefs, diversity training increased creative
   performance when the team's nationality diversity was high, but
   undermined creativity when the team's nationality diversity was low.
   Diversity training had less impact on teams with more positive diversity
   beliefs, and training effects were not contingent upon these teams'
   diversity. Speaking to the underlying process, we showed that these
   interactive effects were driven by the experienced team efficacy of the
   team members. We discuss theoretical and practical implications for
   nationality diversity management.},

Journal = {HUMAN RELATIONS},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {68},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {DeRue and Ashford (2010) proposed a social process of leadership
   identity construction, asserting that leadership identity is
   co-constructed by way of claims and grants of leader and follower
   identities. In addition, these authors suggested that the collective
   endorsement of the broader social context might serve as a catalyst to
   initiate the leader identity construction process. As a result, they
   called for qualitative studies to further develop this idea. During
   archival research of James Meredith's historic integration of the
   University of Mississippi, we discovered evidence to support and extend
   their theoretical arguments. Accordingly, we interpret the archival
   evidence of support and opposition of Meredith's defiant integration to
   contrast the leader identity construction processes of Meredith with his
   contemporary antagonist, former Mississippi Governor Ross Barnett. We
   use this analysis to illustrate how the distinctive social context
   broadly recognized the key element of defiance and collectively endorsed
   Meredith as a leader, thereby initiating his leader identity
   construction process.},

Title = {Do Analyst Stock Recommendations Piggyback on Recent Corporate News? An

Journal = {JOURNAL OF ACCOUNTING RESEARCH},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {53},
Number = {4},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Analysts often update their recommendations following corporate news.
   Questions have been raised regarding analysts' ability to generate new
   information beyond recent corporate events. Employing a comprehensive
   database on corporate news, we show that only a small minority, or
   27.9\%, of all recommendation revisions directionally confirm the
   information in the preceding corporate events and even these confirming
   revisions facilitate the information discovery of corporate events and
   thus cannot simply be dismissed as piggybacking. Our analysis further
   shows that analysts not only facilitate price discovery to corporate
   news through issuing trending revisions but also help reverse prevailing
   market sentiments following corporate news by issuing contrarian
   revisions. Our study is the first to investigate short-window intraday
   market reactions to revisions issued after hours, which account for 70\%
   of all recommendation revisions in our sample period. Analysts'
   incentives to issue revisions after hours appear to reflect demands from
   large institutional clients, who dominate after-hours trading. More
   importantly, we show that the after-hours revisions are associated with
   significantly greater price reactions and different price reaction
   patterns than revisions issued during regular trading hours.
   Collectively, our evidence indicates that analysts are a significant
   source of new information beyond recent corporate news and they also
   help shape the market's assessment of corporate disclosures.},

   related to internal whistleblowing. Team psychological safety partly
   mediates the relationship between authentic leadership and internal

   between authentic leadership and internal whistleblowing. The study
   contributes to the extant theory by filling the gap between leadership
   and whistleblowing.},

Abstract = {This study contributes to the bonding-bridging debate in the social

   social capital. Data generated from simulation reveals that network
   density, a measure of network-level social capital, negatively moderates
   the impacts of firm-level social capitals, measured separately by degree
   centrality and structural hole, on a firm's innovation performance.
   Specifically, in low-density networks, degree centrality and structural
   holes are complementary at enhancing innovation performance. In
   high-density networks, the positive impact of degree centrality weakens
   and structural holes turn out to be detrimental. The findings not only
   advance our understanding of the cross-level dynamics of social capital,
   but also provide a possible explanation for the mixed empirical results

Abstract = {At their core, markets are exchange structures between producers and
   consumers, and products are a key element that connects them together.
   Many new markets emerge in direct ideological opposition to incumbent
   industries. Yet, the ways in which ideology affects products in
   oppositional markets are not well understood. We propose that when
   audiences cannot easily differentiate between products based on physical
   attributes, they rely on ideological discourse about the production
   process. We argue that product names, by embodying linguistically the
   narrative of this discourse, shape the appeal of oppositional products
   to customers. When products have names that are congruent with the
   collective identity of an oppositional market, they have higher appeal.
   This beneficial effect is attenuated (1) when audience expectations
   about what type of product should have an oppositional name are violated
   and (2) when a firm develops a strong organizational identity and
   audiences rely on this identity to make inference about the firm's
   production process. We find support for this theorizing in the
   longitudinal analyses of product appeal in the U.S. craft beer industry,
   1996-2012.},

Title = {The Curvilinear Relationship between Work Passion and Organizational
   Citizenship Behavior},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ETHICS},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {130},
Number = {2},
Pages = {361-374},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Drawing on conservation of resources theory, this study examines the
   curvilinear relationship between harmonious and obsessive work passion
   and organizational citizenship behavior (OCB) as well as the moderating
   effect of collectivistic values. Using 233 paired supervisor-employee
   responses from Russia, I found that harmonious work passion and OCB are
   positively related up to a point, after which higher levels of
   harmonious work passion are associated with declining OCB. The main
   curvilinear effect of obsessive work passion on OCB was not significant.
   Collectivistic values were found to significantly interact with
   obsessive work passion but not harmonious work passion in the way they
   affect OCB. Employees who score high on collectivistic values tend to
   engage more in OCB than those who score low on collectivistic values.
   Interestingly, at low levels of collectivism, the inverted U-shaped
   curve illustrates the relations between obsessive passion and OCB
   changes into a U-shaped curve, suggesting that the highest engagement in
   OCB will no longer be observed at intermediate levels of obsessive work
   passion but rather at its lowest and highest levels. The findings
   contribute to work passion research and suggest that curvilinear rather
   than linear relationships may exist between work passion and work
   outcomes, which may account for the existing inconsistencies in the
   previous studies in regards to whether work passion-outcomes
   relationships are either positive or negative.},

Journal = {ACADEMY OF MANAGEMENT JOURNAL},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {58},
Number = {4},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {This study builds from context-emergent turnover theory to examine the
   dynamic properties of turnover rates, including: (a) the changing
   quality and quantity of the human capital resources that depart, (b) the
   changing turnover dispersion (i.e., how distributed turnover events are
   over time), and (c) the changing quality and quantity of replacement
   hires. We examine these properties using data drawn from a sample of
   retail employees nested within stores of a prominent U.S. retail chain
   over five quarters, and show that the turnover rate (level) is
   conceptually and empirically distinct from turnover rate change, and
   that the two interact with each other to influence changes in unit
   performance. We also find that the relationship between turnover rate
   change and change in unit performance is moderated by both the quality
   of those who leave as well as turnover dispersion. Overall, we
   contribute to turnover rate, staffing, and human capital resource
   literatures by testing core context-emergent turnover theory
   propositions to show when, why, and how turnover rate change and
   replacement hires, as part of a holistic human capital resource system,
   influence unit performance.},

Journal = {ACADEMY OF MANAGEMENT JOURNAL},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {58},
Number = {4},

Abstract = {Although the importance of team motivation has been increasingly
   emphasized, few studies have focused on prosocial motivation.
   Integrating theories on team effectiveness with prosocial motivation, we
   propose a theoretical model that links team prosocial motivation to team
   effectiveness as mediated by team processes. Team process is captured
   through the task-driven process of team cooperation and the affect-based
   team viability, and team effectiveness is operationalized as team
   performance, team organizational citizenship behavior (OCB), and team
   voluntary turnover. The model is tested in Study 1, a field study with
   three-source data collected from 310 members of 67 work teams over four
   time periods, and Study 2, a laboratory experiment with 124 four-person
   teams in which team prosocial motivation is manipulated. In Studies 1
   and 2, we find support for indirect effects of team prosocial motivation
   on team performance and team OCB through the mediating role of team
   cooperation. Team voluntary turnover is indirectly affected by team
   prosocial motivation through team viability. Furthermore, in both
   studies the indirect effects of team prosocial motivation on team
   performance and team OCB through team cooperation and on team voluntary
   turnover through team viability are stronger when the nature of the
   teams' work requires greater task interdependence.},

Title = {Shareholder orientation and the framing of management control practices:
   A field study in a Chinese state-owned enterprise},
Journal = {ACCOUNTING ORGANIZATIONS AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {45},
Pages = {1-23},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {This paper explores how notions of enhanced shareholder orientation
   influenced the evolution of management control practices in a Chinese
   state-owned enterprise over a ten-year period. Drawing on the social
   movement literature and adopting a historically informed field study
   approach we examine how this took the form of a protracted framing
   process where an emerging, shareholder-focused frame interacted with the
   extant work unit frame embedded in Maoist ideology and the broader
   cultural system of Confucianism and imbued control practices with
   context-specific meanings. Particular attention is paid to how this
   interplay fostered varying degrees of frame alignment, denoting the
   extent to which particular frames are congruent with those enacted by
   various social actors, and how this affected organisational action. We
   illustrate how the shareholder-focused frame challenged extant control
   practices but was also complemented and ultimately replaced by the work
   unit frame to address an escalating performance crisis. These findings
   lead us to reflect on how resistance to shareholder-focused control
   practices is brought about and what roles alternative and more deeply
   embedded frames play in constraining as well as enabling collective
   action. We also discuss how the approach to framing informing our
   analysis may complement cognate accounting research drawing on notions
   of performativity and social psychology. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {A social identity perspective on aspirational advertising: Implicit

Abstract = {This research explores the effects of consumers' self-comparisons with
   specific social identities associated with a product-based out-group
   that are primed by aspirational advertising. We hypothesize and find
   that when a consumer's relevant identity is inferior to the primed
   social identity, product attitudes suffer. The process accounting for
   this effect consists of a negative social comparison between the two
   that reduces the consumer's related collective self-esteem. This outcome
   is more (less) apparent under conditions of high comparison salience
   (identification with the inferior in-group). We also demonstrate two
   marketer strategies that alleviate this negative effect: facilitated
   affiliation (i.e., making desired out-group membership appear
   accessible) and indirect self-affirmation (i.e., improving perceptions
   of worth associated with other self identities). The results advance
   theoretical knowledge of social identity processes influencing consumer
   attitudes. (C) 2014 Society for Consumer Psychology. Published by

Title = {Team leader experience in improvement teams: A social networks
   perspective},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {37},
Pages = {13-30},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {In this research, we disentangle the relationship between several key
   aspects of a team leader's experience and the likelihood of improvement
   project success. Using the lens of socio-technical systems, we argue
   that the effect of team leader experience derives from the social system
   as well as the technical system. The aspects of team leader experience
   we examine include team leader social capital (a part of the social
   system) and team leader experience leading projects of the same type (a
   part of the technical system).
   We examine four different, yet related, dimensions of a team leader's
   social capital, which we motivate based on the social networks
   literature. One dimension, team leader familiarity, suggests that social
   capital is created when team leaders have experience working with
   current team members on prior improvement projects, and that such social
   capital increases the likelihood of improvement project success. We
   develop three additional dimensions, using social network analysis
   (SNA), to capture the idea that the improvement team leader's social
   capital extends beyond the current team to include everyone the leader
   has previously worked with on improvement projects. Contrasting our
   SNA-based dimensions with team leader familiarity enables us to better
   understand the impact of a team leader's social capital both inside and
   beyond the team. We also examine the effect of a team leader's
   experience leading prior projects of the same type, and consider the
   extent to which organizational experience may moderate the impact of
   both team leader social capital and same-type project experience.
   Based on analysis of archival data of six sigma projects spanning six
   years from a Fortune 500 consumer products manufacturer, we find that
   two of our SNA-based dimensions of team leader social capital, as well
   as experience leading projects of the same type, increase the likelihood
   of project success. In addition, we show that organizational experience
   moderates the relationship between team leader same-type project
   experience and project success. However, this is not the case for the
   relationship between the dimensions of team leader social capital and
   project success. These results provide insights regarding how dimensions
   of team leader experience and organizational experience collectively
   impact the operational performance of improvement teams. (C) 2015

Abstract = {This study theorized and examined the influence of the interaction

   Using a sample of 569 employees and 142 managers in footwear retail

   reduced the influences of one another on collective customer knowledge
   and service climate, such that the positive influence of service
   leadership on collective customer knowledge and service climate was
   stronger when Service-Oriented HPWSs were lower than when they were
   higher or the positive influence of Service-Oriented HPWSs on collective
   customer knowledge and service climate was stronger when service
   leadership was lower than when it was higher. We further proposed and
   found that collective customer knowledge and service climate were
   positively related to objective financial outcomes through service

Abstract = {Over the past 15 years, regulatory focus has gained prominence as a
   theory of self-regulatory motivation. Building from personality and
   social psychology research, the nomological network of regulatory focus
   spans individuals, groups, and organizations. This review provides an
   appraisal of regulatory focus from a multilevel perspective as it
   relates to organizational behavior, human resources, strategic
   management, and entrepreneurship. We begin with a discussion of the
   theoretical foundations of regulatory focus, including hierarchical
   motivation and regulatory fit theory. Using these foundations, we
   summarize empirical research on regulatory focus and provide actionable
   avenues for future research on regulatory focus, with particular
   attention paid to how individuals adjust their motivational strategies
   on the basis of context. We also consider regulatory focus as a
   collective function of teams to develop our understanding of
   motivational processes in the workplace.},

Abstract = {This paper studies the link between firm-level predicaments in

   start-up businesses and public sector officials work around inadequacies
   in order to move forward clusters composed mostly of high-technology

   development of clusters. Empirical findings from three IT clusters in
   Vietnam reveal resource inadequacies, private sector actors' inability
   to resolve such shortcomings, entrepreneurial passivity, risk aversion,
   and lack of confidence in governmental initiatives. These findings and
   the comparison with earlier studies about start-up difficulties in other

Year = {2015},
Volume = {25},
Number = {3},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {The cultural lens through which an ad is viewed can affect the extent to
   which an endorser of the product in an ad and the message s(he)
   communicates are thought about in relation to one another. Consumers
   with a collectivist mindset tend to think about information
   relationally. Consequently, they consider the endorsement in relation to
   the endorser and this affects their memory for both. It also affects
   recipients' concern with the fit between the endorser's message and the
   endorser and consequently influences their judgments of both the ad and
   the product being advertised. When people have an individualist mindset,
   on the other hand, they appear to treat the endorser and the endorsement
   as independent pieces of information and are less sensitive to their
   fit. Four studies support these conclusions and provide insights into
   how endorser-message relatedness impacts persuasion under different
   cultural mindset conditions. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier Inc. on

Abstract = {Teams are composed of individual members who collectively contribute to
   team success. As a result, contemporary team research tends to focus on
   how team overall properties (e.g., the average of team personality and
   behavior) affect team processes and effectiveness while overlooking the
   potential unique influences of specific members on team outcomes.
   Drawing on minority influence theory (Grant \& Patil, 2012), we extend
   previous teams research by demonstrating that an extra miler (i.e., a
   team member exhibiting the highest frequency of extra-role behaviors in
   a team) can influence team processes and, ultimately, team effectiveness
   beyond the influences of all the other members. Specifically, based on a
   field study, we report that the extra miler's behavioral influences
   (i.e., helping and voice) on team monitoring and backup processes and
   team effectiveness are contingent on his or her network position in the
   team, such that the member tends to have stronger influence on team
   outcomes when he or she is in a central position. We also find that even
   a single extra miler in a vital position plays a more important role in
   driving team processes and outcomes than do all the other members.
   Therefore, our research offers an important contribution to the team
   literature by demonstrating the disproportionate influences of specific
   team members on team overall outcomes.},

Abstract = {This paper investigates the process that leads from job dissatisfaction
   to new business opportunities in organizations that offshore R\&D
   activities to emerging countries. Specifically, we investigate a major
   source of job dissatisfaction for offshore professionals: the
   misalignment between the work that they perform and their professional
   identity. Our findings indicate that offshore professionals react
   against the perception of a threat to work-identity integrity through
   individual and collective job crafting. A significant outcome of job
   crafting is the introduction of new markets, industries, and services,
   which in turn may change a professional's job design. The perceptions of
   the compatibility of organizational identity with professional identity
   and with new idea recognition on the one hand, and of distant and local
   social support on the other, act as intervening conditions in the
   process. We discuss theoretical contributions to the evolution of
   offshoring, job crafting, and the interplay between organizational and
   professional identity, together with managerial implications.},

Abstract = {Teams are pervasive in today's world, and rightfully so as we need them.
   Drawing upon the existing extensive body of research surrounding the
   topic of teamwork, we delineate nine critical considerations that serve
   as a practical heuristic by which HR leaders can determine what is
   needed when they face situations involving teamwork. Our heuristic is
   not intended to be the definitive set of all considerations for
   teamwork, but instead consolidates key findings from a vast literature
   to provide an integrated understanding of the underpinnings of
   teamworkspecifically, what should be considered when selecting,
   developing, and maintaining teams. This heuristic is designed to help
   those in practice diagnose team-based problems by providing a clear
   focus on relevant aspects of teamwork. To this end, we first define
   teamwork and its related elements. Second, we offer a high-level
   conceptualization of and justification for the nine selected
   considerations underlying the heuristic, which is followed by a more
   in-depth synthesis of related literature as well as empirically-driven
   practical guidance. Third, we conclude with a discussion regarding how
   this heuristic may best be used from a practical standpoint, as well as
   offer areas for future research regarding both teamwork and its critical
   considerations. (c) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

Abstract = {Prior research indicates that employees engage in organizational
   citizenship behaviors (OCBs) because of prosocial values, organizational
   concern, and impression management motives. Building upon and extending
   prior research, we investigate all 3 OCB motives by developing a
   categorization scheme to differentiate their distinctiveness and by
   building a contextualized argument regarding their interactive effects
   on OCB in a more collectivistic culture. In a sample of 379 Chinese
   employee-supervisor dyads from Taiwan, we found that the relationship
   between prosocial values motives and OCBs directed at individuals was
   strengthened by organizational concern motives; likewise, the
   relationship between organizational concern and OCBs directed at the
   organization was strengthened by prosocial values motives. However, in
   contrast to prior research (Grant \& Mayer, 2009), the relationship
   between prosocial values motives and OCBs directed at individuals was
   weakened by impression management motives. A 3-way interaction between
   all 3 motives further suggests that, in Asian cultures, impression
   management motives may undermine the positive effects of prosocial
   values and organizational concern motives on OCBs directed at
   individuals but not OCBs directed at the organization.},

Abstract = {This paper examines voluntary disclosures in a repeated oligopoly and

   nondisclosure is prevalent and results in stable product prices and high
   profit margins. Otherwise, firms may selectively disclose to soften
   competition in the product market. Under partial disclosure, firms
   withhold information during sharp industry expansions or declines.
   Consequently, the disclosure policy dampens the dissemination of shocks
   to the industry.},

   structural holes enhances the innovative performance of employees with
   an adaptive cognitive style; however, individuals with an innovative
   cognitive style are most innovative when embedded within a closed
   network of densely interconnected contacts. Using data on the individual
   cognitive styles and complete workplace social networks of all employees
   within a design and manufacturing firm, we show that our theorized
   contingency mechanism accounts for a large share of empirical variation

Abstract = {Moral responsibility for outcomes in corporate settings can be ascribed
   either to the individual members, the corporation, or both. In the
   latter case, the relationship between individual and corporate
   responsibility has been approached as inversely proportional, such that
   an increase in individual responsibility leads to a corresponding
   decrease in corporate responsibility and vice versa. In this article, we
   develop a non-proportionate approach, where, under specific conditions,
   individual and corporate moral responsibilities interact dynamically,
   leading to a mutual enhancement of responsibility: the more the
   corporation is responsible, the more the individuals become responsible
   and vice versa. We develop this mutually enhancing approach in terms of
   normative ascriptions of responsibility, while leaving aside empirical
   implications in terms of mutual awareness of responsibility between
   individuals and corporations. We explore conceptually the conditions and
   mechanisms that generate this mutual enhancement and also discuss the
   implications for research and practice.},

Abstract = {Psychological capital (PsyCap) has been conceptualized as an
   individual-level construct concerned with an employee's state of
   positive psychological development. However, research has now started to
   examine PsyCap as a collective phenomenon. Although positive
   associations between team-level PsyCap and team-level functioning have
   been demonstrated empirically, there has been limited synopsis regarding
   the theoretical and measurement foundations of PsyCap at higher levels
   of analysis. This conceptual article extends collective PsyCap
   scholarship by applying a multilevel-multireferent framework to explore
   alternate conceptualizations of collective PsyCap. The framework
   furthers understanding of PsyCap at higher levels by exploring unique
   antecedents and emergent processes relating to five proposed forms of
   collective PsyCap. A series of testable propositions pertaining to the
   antecedent network of collective PsyCap are offered to guide empirical
   multilevel PsyCap research.},

Abstract = {We examine whether short interest improves the informativeness of stock
   prices with respect to future earnings. We find that short selling
   strengthens the relation between current returns and future earnings,
   especially in settings where short sellers are likely to possess an
   information advantage, such as when a firm's information environment is
   weak or when analysts are highly optimistic about future earnings
   growth. Collectively, our results illustrate the important role that
   short sellers play in improving the extent to which current stock prices
   reflect information about future earnings and thus in improving market
   efficiency.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF FINANCIAL ECONOMICS},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {116},
Number = {3},
Pages = {505-525},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {We provide a tractable model of firm-level expected holding period
   returns using two firm fundamentals-book-to-market ratio and return on
   equity-and study the cross-sectional properties of the model-implied
   expected returns. We find that firm-level expected returns and expected
   profitability are time-varying but highly persistent and that forecasts
   of holding period returns strongly predict the cross section of future
   returns up to three years ahead. We show a highly significant predictive
   pooled regression slope for future quarterly returns of 0.86. The
   popular factor-based expected return models have either an insignificant
   or a significantly negative association with future returns. In
   supplemental analyses, we show that these forecasts are also informative
   of the time series variation in aggregate conditions. For a
   representative firm, the slope of the conditional expected return curve
   is more positive in good times, when expected short-run returns are
   relatively low, and the model-implied forecaster of aggregate returns
   exhibits modest predictive ability. Collectively, we provide a simple,
   theoretically motivated, and practically useful approach to estimating
   multi-period-ahead expected returns. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

   collectives of scholars from many social sciences and methodological
   orientations. While a few articles have reviewed the level of diversity

   expansive look at what is studied, how it is examined, and which
   consumers are used to determine the validity of our theoretical

Journal = {JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ETHICS},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {128},
Number = {3},
Pages = {685-700},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {This paper argues that the literature examining the role that MNCs play
   in `political CSR'aEuro{''}an emerging area of management research
   concern-can be enhanced by more a fulsome examination of the `varieties
   of capitalism' that currently exist in the global economy. We argue that
   the willingness and capacity of a particular MNC to participate in
   governance activity-which we broadly equate to political CSR-are
   contingent, at least in part, upon the national systems of
   government-business relations present in its home market. We argue that
   the decisions MNCs make in terms of whether and how to participate in
   governance are predicated in part on the domestic system of
   business-government relations out of which they emerge. The paper then
   asserts that our current conceptions of political CSR are limited,
   because they do not take fully into account the increasingly important
   corporate form of statism, in which home governments maintain a large
   ownership position in the country's MNCs, even as they expand abroad. We
   posit that a key question this reality poses is whether such companies
   will reinforce established patterns of `political CSR', whether they
   will challenge those established patterns, or whether some mutual
   adaptation will occur. We conclude the article with some suggestions for
   how this question might be explored in future work by interested
   scholars.},

Volume = {43},

Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {We examine whether the relationship between political connections and
   firm value is moderated by the length of time firms have been
   politically connected. We find that compared to firms with political
   connections for a short period, firms with political connections for a
   long period have a smaller magnitude of negative stock price reaction to
   the 2008 General Election loss of the supermajority by the ruling party
   in Malaysia. We also find that the smaller magnitude of negative stock
   price reaction is, in part, attributable to improvements in board of
   director characteristics. Furthermore, we find that while the
   performance subsequent to the General Election of politically connected
   firms is worse than that of non-politically connected firms, firms with
   political connections for a long period exhibit better performance than
   those connected for short periods. Collectively, the evidence shows that
   the length of political connections is an important factor that
   moderates economic value. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

   organizational inducements and employees' organizational citizenship
   behavior (OCB). Among a sample of Chinese employees, the authors find
   that the organizational inducements of perceived supervisor support and
   participation led to higher levels of PIS, which in turn enhanced OCB.
   Furthermore, vertical collectivism moderated the relationship between
   PIS and OCB, such that their relationship grew stronger when
   collectivism was high. These findings have notable implications for

Journal = {JOURNAL OF FINANCIAL ECONOMICS},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {116},
Number = {2},
Pages = {410-431},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Applying a ``co-search{''} algorithm to Internet traffic at the SEC's
   EDGAR website, we develop a novel method for identifying economically
   related peer firms and for measuring their relative importance. Our
   results show that firms appearing in chronologically adjacent searches
   by the same individual (Search-Based Peers or SBPs) are fundamentally
   similar on multiple dimensions. In direct tests, SBPs dominate GICS6
   industry peers in explaining cross-sectional variations in base firms'
   out-of-sample: (a) stock returns, (b) valuation multiples, (c) growth
   rates, (d) R\&D expenditures, (e) leverage, and (f) profitability
   ratios. We show that SBPs are not constrained by standard industry
   classification, and are more dynamic, pliable, and concentrated. We also
   show that co-search intensity captures the degree of similarity between
   firms. Our results highlight the potential of the collective wisdom of
   investors extracted from co-search patterns in addressing long-standing
   benchmarking problems in finance. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {The structuration of issue-based fields: Social accountability, social
   movements and the Equator Principles issue-based field},

Abstract = {This paper presents a longitudinal case study examining why and how
   commercial banks sought to integrate sustainability issues into their
   project finance operations between 2003 and 2008. We study the evolution
   of a set of influential environmental and social risk management
   guidelines for project finance - the Equator Principles (EP) - and the
   simultaneous structuration of a field around these guidelines focused on
   the issue of socially accountable project finance. The case is
   theoretically framed using Hoffman's (1999) concept of an issue-based
   field and associated conceptualisations of the role of internal and
   external (social) movements in the structuration of these fields. The
   structuration of the issue-based field studied is shown to encompass a
   dynamic, contested process involving extensive interactions between a
   non-governmental organization (NGO) movement and a commercial bank
   movement. We unveil how the conflicting, collective rationales and
   actions of both movements fuelled the structuration process and
   facilitated an evolution in the social accountability of commercial
   banks. While prior work sees little potential for civil society actors
   to engage with and move corporate social responsibility and reporting in
   a more challenging direction, we reveal how the NGO movement evoked a
   progression in social responsibility and reporting in a sector that had
   previously shown little inclination to address its wider social
   accountability. Drawing on our case analysis, we theorize how
   issue-based fields cohere and crystallise, particularly how they build
   an institutional infrastructure based upon the infrastructure of the
   mature field which they straddle and which the relevant issue impacts
   upon. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Number = {3},

Abstract = {Sixty-eight stores of a retail chain were used for testing a model in
   which perceived authentic leadership (AL) predicts stores' sales
   achievement through the mediating role of perceived store virtuousness
   and perceived store potency. Employees reported AL, store virtuousness,
   and store potency. Sales achievement over a period of four consecutive
   months subsequent to data collection (on independent and mediating
   variables) was considered as dependent variable (for control: sales
   achievement in the previous 4 months). The main findings are the
   following: (a) AL predicts store potency through the mediating role of
   store virtuousness; (b) store virtuousness predicts sales achievement
   through the mediating role of store potency; (c) AL predicts sales
   achievement via the mediating role of both store virtuousness and store
   potency. By focusing on three positive constructs, whose interrelations
   have scarcely been explored, and relating them to store performance, the
   study enriches the Positive Organizational Scholarship movement, and
   suggests that AL and virtuousness are good in themselves and also
   potential facilitators of group success.},

Pages = {867-888},
Month = {MAY-JUN},
Abstract = {Whereas the deliberative democracy approach to ethics seeks to bridge
   universalist reason and contextual judgment to explain the emergence of
   intersubjective agreements, it remains unclear how these two are
   reconciled in practice. We argue that a sensemaking approach is useful
   for examining how ethical truces emerge in equivocal situations. To
   understand how actors navigate through ethical complexity, we conducted
   an ethnographic inquiry into the multistakeholder practices of setting
   Fairtrade Minimum Prices. We offer three contributions. First, we
   develop a process model of ethics as sensemaking that explains how
   actors come to collectively agree on what is ethical in complex
   situations, even if no complete consensus arises. Second, our findings
   suggest that moral intuition and affect also motivate ethical judgment
   alongside moral reasoning. Third, an ethical sensemaking perspective
   explains some of the pitfalls actors confront in coping with ethical
   complexities in practice and how they attend to the challenges arising
   from stark inequalities in extreme contexts.},

Abstract = {This study uses a novel situation of organizing, bicycle commuting, to
   develop an argument regarding the requirements for collective action and
   increased autonomy for the material in constituting organizations. We
   found that through individual material and spatial practices, bike
   commuters constitute themselves as a collective, making their presence
   known and creating possibility for change. However, bike commuters'
   discourses indicate that they do not experience a collective identity or
   sense of community of practice. We use this study to extend two areas of
   theory. First, we suggest that collective action can take place without
   organization or organizing: individual activities can aggregate to have
   an effect even if they are not officially coordinated or members do not
   acknowledge membership in a collective. Second, we suggest that this
   example moves beyond previous work on the communicative constitution of
   organizations to suggest that the material can constitute a collective,
   even without human, discursive recognition of it.},

Journal = {PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {24},
Number = {4},
Pages = {560-586},

Abstract = {High-tech organizations often struggle to manage different types of R\&D
   projects. Evidence from research and practice suggests that managers
   frequently categorize and manage projects based on the extent of change
   triggered in product, process, technology, and market dimensions.
   However, this can create challenges in high-tech organizations. This
   study investigates how high-tech organizations manage R\&D projects
   based on their learning goals. First, we argue for the benefits of
   categorizing R\&D projects based on the degree of exploration and
   exploitation learning goals. A qualitative case study from four
   high-tech business units involving 10 R\&D projects helps understand the
   different types of projects based on their learning goals. The case
   study shows that R\&D projects in high-tech organizations typically fall
   into three categories based on their learning goals: Radical innovation
   projects, Incremental innovation projects, and Hybrid projects. Second,
   we iterate between literature and evidence from our qualitative data to
   theorize how project context and organizational context affect project
   performance depending on the type of project. The data for the empirical
   analysis come from a multilevel survey of 110 R\&D projects across 34
   high-tech business units. Results show the importance of designing
   project and organizational context differently for the three types of
   R\&D projects. Collectively, this study offers a new perspective on how
   to manage high-tech R\&D projects.},

Journal = {HUMAN RELATIONS},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {68},
Number = {4},
Pages = {545-560},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {In this response to Samia Chreim's (2015) discussion, it is argued that
   her article makes an important contribution to recent attempts to define
   non-heroic approaches to leadership. The primary focus of her article is
   on the merger and acquisition process as experienced by five firms (an
   acquiring firm and four acquired business units), and a comparative
   analysis of transitional leadership patterns in light of explicit
   pre-merger undertakings given about, and consequent expectations of,
   subsequent leadership. These expectations were about distributed
   leadership. In some instances the acquired firms' expectations were
   fulfilled while in others they were not. As is pointed out in this
   response, Chreim's discussion is significant for the growing body of
   literature on distributed leadership and, by implication, for wider
   questions concerned with the appropriate unit of analysis in leadership.
   Recent scholarship is shown to have been wrestling with different ways
   of conceptualizing (and researching) leadership in plural or multiple
   terms, with much of this work occurring in the sub-fields of leadership
   (such as school education, higher education and public health) rather
   than in the generic leadership field. On the basis of her findings,
   Chreim's discussion queries the value of distributed' and instead she
   opts for the idea of leadership configurations. Some of the problems and
   possibilities of this alternative are discussed, along with suggestions
   about ways in which Chreim's work might be extended to advance knowledge
   in the field, particularly in relation to the idea of group agency.},

Abstract = {We employed a longitudinal, grounded-theory approach to investigate the
   occurrence of an identity crisis in an emerging collective of
   organizations attempting to form a new academic field. The findings
   indicate that legacy identities and the nested structure of such
   organizations have implications for the formation of identity at this
   level. Specifically, the co-evolution of organization-level and
   collective-level identities, and the interdependencies between the
   levels, rendered the collective identity formation process as
   multiphased, complex, contentious, and continuously
   precarious-ultimately leading to an identity crisis that was resolved
   not by arriving at a ``consensual identity,{''} but, rather, a
   ``coherent identity.{''} The findings contribute to the nascent stream
   of literature on collective identity beyond the organizational level by
   explicating identity-work processes involved in the precipitation,
   manifestation, and resolution of an identity crisis in an emerging
   field.},

Volume = {41},
Number = {3},

Abstract = {Organizations must learn and adapt to succeed in today's ever-changing
   business environment, so it is essential for scholars to better
   understand the antecedents to learning processes among individuals,
   teams, and organizations as a whole. In this article, the authors offer
   a multilevel theory that illustrates how individuals' motivation for
   different achievement goals, that is, goal orientations, shape the way
   they individually and collectively participate in organizational
   learning processes. This framework is grounded in a theoretical
   synthesis of organizational learning and achievement goal theories,
   which highlights the value of using an emergent motivational theory to
   better understand how predominantly cognitive learning processes may
   emerge across levels in organizations. In particular, the authors
   illustrate how mastery- and performance-oriented norms emerge in work
   groups and influence information interpretation and integration. The
   authors further describe how groups' goal orientation norms can become
   embedded in the organizational culture, which impacts the ways in which
   learning processes are institutionalized throughout the organization.
   This theoretical framework provides a fuller depiction of why and how
   learning unfolds in organizations, which may facilitate future research
   on the microfoundations of organizational learning and how these can
   enable organizations to enhance their capabilities.},

Abstract = {Donating money to a charity based on consumer purchase is referred to as

   psychographics for skepticism toward advertising in a CRM context. To be
   specific, this study investigates whether and how psychological
   antecedents (i.e., consumer shopping orientation and mindset) and gender
   differences influence consumer skepticism toward advertising. An
   empirical study was conducted with 291 participants. Structural equation
   modeling was employed for hypothesis testing. The results suggest that a
   utilitarian orientation and an individualistic mindset are positively
   related to skepticism toward advertising, while a hedonic orientation
   and a collectivistic mindset are negatively related to skepticism toward
   advertising. Gender differences are also found in the aforementioned
   relationships. The segmentational approach of gender and psychographics
   can assist marketers to explain consumer attitudes toward CRM and then
   to communicate with those CRM advocates better.},

   Action},
Journal = {INFORMATION SYSTEMS RESEARCH},

Volume = {26},
Number = {1},
Pages = {40-56},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {In this paper, we examine the challenges around the development and
   scalability of information infrastructures. We identify two possible
   solutions proposed in the literature, one emphasizing more top-down
   control and the need for a clear IT governance framework, and a second
   arguing for a more flexible approach since absolute control is
   impossible and only leads to drift and unintended outcomes. We suggest
   that there is a clear gap in the literature in better understanding how
   to govern the development of information infrastructures using a
   bottom-up approach. We build on research that approaches IS development
   as a collective action problem and focus on how different actors frame
   the infrastructure as a public and private good, and how the framing
   process is underpinned by actors' different ideologies. We use our
   theoretical approach to examine the framing of the development of a
   regional health information infrastructure in Crete. Our analysis
   examines how different actors frame the infrastructure as a collective
   action good and explore their ideological positioning. We explore the
   struggle around meanings attributed to the good over time as being a
   public or private one in establishing or sustaining relations of power,
   and how legitimacy is challenged or reinforced. Finally, we develop
   contributions on the collective action challenges in infrastructure
   development and suggest how a polycentric approach to governance might
   be further developed to promote the ongoing cultivation of information
   infrastructures from the bottom up.},

Journal = {ORGANIZATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {26},
Number = {2},

Month = {MAR-APR},
Abstract = {This paper investigates knowledge hoarding, defined as an individual's
   deliberate and strategic concealment of information, and perceived
   hoarding, defined as coworkers' beliefs that an individual is engaged in
   hoarding. We hypothesize that knowledge hoarding increases an
   individual's job performance by enhancing bargaining power and
   influence, whereas perceived hoarding decreases the individual's job
   performance because coworkers withdraw social support. We further
   suggest that knowledge hoarding and perceived hoarding are both
   detrimental to unit performance because they hurt work-related
   interactions and impair the unit's ability to respond quickly to
   problems. Using a sample of 297 individuals embedded in 41 units in the
   U.S. Forest Service, we find that the positive effect of hoarding on
   individual performance is mediated by bargaining power, whereas the
   negative effect of perceived hoarding on individual performance is
   mediated by social support. In addition, individual hoarding and
   perceived hoarding both diminish unit performance. Collectively, our
   results reveal the mixed fortunes that befall individuals and their
   organizations as a result of knowledge hoarding and suspected hoarding
   activity.},

Abstract = {The study of collective cognition has taken many forms in recent years,
   including collective managerial cognition, organizational learning,
   shared mental models, transactive memory and psychological climate.
   However, few studies have confronted the foundational ideas underlying
   group mentality directly, leaving the concept as largely metaphorical.
   The current work reviews foundational debates around the conceptual
   components of group minds to serve as a meta-theoretical heuristic to
   orient future research. To lay out this framework, conceptual
   distinctions are drawn between phenomenal, vehicle, content and context
   elements of cognition. Next, existing approaches are reframed as
   conjunctions of claims across the four levels, leading to a distinction
   between configurationalist, situated and extended views of collective
   cognition. Finally, future research is proposed regarding the interfaces
   between conceptual levels and the possibility of establishing bona fide
   group mental entities.},

Month = {MAR-APR},
Abstract = {We study a situation where several independent service providers
   collaborate by complete pooling of their resources and customer streams
   into a joint service system. These service providers may represent such
   diverse organizations as hospitals that pool beds or maintenance firms
   that pool repairmen. We model the service systems as Erlang delay
   systems (M / M / s queues) that face a fixed cost rate per server and
   homogeneous delay costs for waiting customers. We examine rules to
   fairly allocate the collective costs of the pooled system amongst the
   participants by applying concepts from cooperative game theory. We
   consider both the case where players' numbers of servers are exogenously
   given and the scenario where any coalition picks an optimal number of
   servers. By exploiting new analytical properties of the continuous
   extension of the classic Erlang delay function, we provide sufficient
   conditions for the games under consideration to possess a core
   allocation (i.e., an allocation that gives no group of players an
   incentive to split off and form a separate pool) and to admit a
   population monotonic allocation scheme (whereby adding extra players
   does not make anyone worse off). This is not guaranteed in general, as
   illustrated via examples.},

Title = {Idiosyncratic Deals and Voice Behavior},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Informed by social exchange theory, this study examines whether and how
   employees reciprocate to their organizations for the idiosyncratic deals
   (i-deals) they receive. Specifically, the authors examined whether
   i-deals (in scheduling flexibility and professional development) are
   related to employees' flexible work role orientation, social networking
   behavior, and organizational trust over time. In turn, they hypothesized
   that these mediating variables would be positively related to employees'
   use of constructive voice. Data were collected from 466 managers and
   professionals in the United States and China at three points in time
   over a 10-month period. The data analyses revealed that flexible work
   role orientation, social networking behavior, and organizational trust
   all mediated the relationship between i-deals and voice behavior.
   Furthermore, the mediating effects were generally stronger for
   professional development i-deals than for scheduling flexibility i-deals
   and were generally stronger in the China sample than in the U.S. sample.
   The article concludes with a discussion of the utility of social
   exchange theory as a framework for future research on i-deals and for
   guiding the implementation of i-deals in organizational settings.},

Abstract = {This study explores the role of social media in social change by
   analyzing Twitter data collected during the 2011 Egypt Revolution.
   Particular attention is paid to the notion of collective sense making,
   which is considered a critical aspect for the emergence of collective
   action for social change. We suggest that collective sense making
   through social media can be conceptualized as human-machine
   collaborative information processing that involves an interplay of
   signs, Twitter grammar, humans, and social technologies. We focus on the
   occurrences of hashtags among a high volume of tweets to study the
   collective sense-making phenomena of milling and keynoting. A
   quantitative Markov switching analysis is performed to understand how
   the hashtag frequencies vary over time, suggesting structural changes
   that depict the two phenomena. We further explore different hashtags
   through a qualitative content analysis and find that, although many
   hashtags were used as symbolic anchors to funnel online users' attention
   to the Egypt Revolution, other hashtags were used as part of tweet
   sentences to share changing situational information. We suggest that
   hashtags functioned as a means to collect information and maintain
   situational awareness during the unstable political situation of the
   Egypt Revolution.},

Abstract = {Team reflexivity, the extent to which teams collectively reflect upon
   and adapt their working methods and functioning, has been shown to be an
   important predictor of team outcomes, notably innovation. As described
   in the current article, the authors developed and tested a team-level
   contingency model of team reflexivity, work demands, and innovation.
   They argue that highly reflexive teams will be more innovative than
   teams low in reflexivity when facing a demanding work environment. A
   field study of 98 primary health care teams in the United Kingdom
   corroborated their predictions: Team reflexivity was positively related
   to team innovation, and team reflexivity and work demands interacted
   such that high levels of both predicted higher levels of team
   innovation. Furthermore, an interaction between team reflexivity,
   quality of physical work environment (PWE), and team innovation showed
   that poor PWE coupled with high team reflexivity was associated with
   higher levels of team innovation. These results are discussed in the
   context of the need for team reflexivity and team innovation among teams
   at work facing high levels of work demands.},

Abstract = {In order to enable firms to successfully deal with issues of corporate
   sustainability, the firms' stakeholders would need to participate in
   sustainability accounting and management. In practice, however,
   participative sustainability accounting and management are often

   aspects of sustainability. The purpose of this article is to show that
   reflexivity in sustainability accounting and management, that is, an
   ongoing reflection on the relationship between the goals of corporate
   sustainability and the overarching objective of sustainable development
   can, at least, mitigate this problem. Reflexivity has the potential to
   initiate processes of collective learning and could eventually bring
   about the realization of business models that integrate economic,

Abstract = {In Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission (2010), the US Supreme
   Court sharply curtailed the ability of the state to limit political
   speech by for-profit corporations. This new legal situation elevates the
   question of corporate political involvement: in what manner and to what
   extent is it ethical for for-profit corporations to participate in the
   political process in a liberal democratic society? Using Scanlon's
   version of contractualism, I argue for a number of substantive and
   procedural constraints on the political activities of businesses.
   Central to this contractualist analysis is (1) an identification of the
   self-governance-based interests of individuals that are affected by
   corporate political activity and (2) a method for judging the various
   assignments of social rights, duties and roles according to how they
   collectively meet those interests. Together, these two features make
   this contractualist approach distinctive and allow it to generate
   substantive ethical results.},

Journal = {INFORMATION SYSTEMS RESEARCH},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {26},
Number = {1},
Pages = {224-237},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Voluntary contributions are crucial to the success of open source
   software (OSS) projects. Firms sponsoring OSS projects may face
   substantial challenges in soliciting such contributions, since volunteer
   participants are neither regulated by an employment contract nor offered
   financial incentives. Although prior work has shown the positive impact
   of motivation on the effort expended by volunteer participants, there is
   limited understanding of how specific firm attributes shape volunteers'
   intrinsic motivation. We offer a theoretical model of how the perceived
   community-based credibility and openness of the sponsoring firm have a
   positive impact on the intrinsic motivation of volunteer participants.
   The model is explored using survey data on volunteer participants from
   two sponsored OSS projects. Results show that a sponsoring firm's
   community-based credibility (OSS developers' perception of its expertise
   and trustworthiness) and openness (its mutual knowledge exchange with
   the community) strengthen the volunteer participants' social
   identification with the firm-sponsored community, which in turn
   reinforces their intrinsic motivation to participate. Moreover, the
   perceived community-based credibility of a sponsoring firm directly
   enhances volunteer participants' intrinsic motivation, whereas perceived
   openness fails to affect motivation without the mediating mechanism of
   social identification. Implications for firms seeking voluntary
   contributions for their sponsored OSS projects are discussed.},

Title = {Team Scaffolds: How Mesolevel Structures Enable Role-Based Coordination
   in Temporary Groups},
Journal = {ORGANIZATION SCIENCE},

Volume = {26},
Number = {2},
Pages = {405-422},
Month = {MAR-APR},
Abstract = {This paper shows how mesolevel structures support effective coordination
   in temporary groups. Prior research on coordination in temporary groups
   describes how roles encode individual responsibilities so that
   coordination between relative strangers is possible. We extend this
   research by introducing key tenets from team effectiveness research to
   theorize when role-based coordination might be more or less effective.
   We develop these ideas in a multimethod study of a hospital emergency
   department (ED) redesign. Before the redesign, people coordinated in ad
   hoc groupings, which provided flexibility because any nurse could work
   with any doctor, but these groupings were limited in effectiveness
   because people were not accountable to each other for progress, did not
   have shared understanding of their work, and faced interpersonal risks
   when reaching out to other roles. The redesign introduced new mesolevel
   structures that bounded a set of roles (rather than a set of specific
   individuals, as in a team) and gave them collective responsibility for a
   whole task. We conceptualized the mesolevel structures as team scaffolds
   and found that they embodied the logic of both role and team structures.
   The team scaffolds enabled small-group interactions to take the form of
   an actual team process with team-level prioritizing, updating, and
   helping, based on newfound accountability, overlapping representations
   of work, and belonging-despite the lack of stable team composition.
   Quantitative data revealed changes to the coordination patterns in the
   ED (captured through a two-mode network) after the team scaffolds were
   implemented and showed a 40\% improvement in patient throughput time.},

Abstract = {We present a comprehensive theory of collective organizational
   engagement, integrating engagement theory with the resource management
   model. We propose that engagement can be considered an
   organization-level construct influenced by motivationally focused
   organizational practices that represent firm-level resources.
   Specifically, we evaluate three distinct organizational practices as
   resources-motivating work design, human resource management practices,
   and CEO transformational leadership-that can facilitate perceptions that
   members of the organization are as a whole physically, cognitively, and
   emotionally invested at work. Our theory is grounded in the notion that,
   when used jointly, these organizational resources maximize each of the
   three underlying psychological conditions necessary for full engagement;
   namely, psychological meaningfulness, safety, and availability. The
   resource management model also underscores the value of top management
   team members implementing and monitoring progress on the firm's strategy
   as a means to enhance the effects of organizational resources on
   collective organizational engagement. We empirically test this theory in
   a sample of 83 firms, and provide evidence that collective
   organizational engagement mediates the relationship between the three
   organizational resources and firm performance. Furthermore, we find that
   strategic implementation positively moderates the relationship between
   the three organizational resources and collective organizational
   engagement. Implications for theory, research, and practice are
   discussed.},

Abstract = {This article explores changing strategies of managerial control in a
   labour-intensive factory in South China at a time of labour shortage. It
   describes power relationships between capital and migrant labour under
   changing labour market conditions, migrant cohorts and global business
   environment, and analyses a new paternalist managerial strategy named
   humanized management' and workers' reactions to it. Although humanized
   management', as part of East Asian paternalism, advocates mutual
   respect, care and reciprocity between management and labour, it
   constructs workers as irresponsible, spoiled children needing to be led,
   moved, touched, taught and ruled. Its human focus notwithstanding, the
   new strategy did not result in substantial reforms of managerial
   despotism, nor did the factory institute any welfare programs for
   workers. Because of these discrepancies between the ideological avowals
   and practical application of humanized management', the new approach was
   disregarded by workers, who preferred to rely on individual measures
   such as threats to quit, or collective action, to win concessions from
   management. The study provides new insight into the changing
   relationship between capital and migrant workers in South China and
   informs the debate in industrial sociology and human resource management
   research about the efficacy of East Asian paternalist management in
   improving capital-labour relationships.},

Abstract = {Consistent with predictions from the psychology literature, we find that
   stock prices co-move more (less) in culturally tight (loose) and
   collectivistic (individualistic) countries. Culture influences stock
   price synchronicity by affecting correlations in investors' trading
   activities and a country's information environment. Both market-wide and
   firm-specific variations are lower in tighter cultures. Individualism is
   mostly associated with higher firm-specific variations. Trade and
   financial openness weakens the effect of domestic culture on stock price
   comovements. These results hold for various robustness checks. Our study
   suggests that culture is an important omitted variable in the literature
   that investigates cross-country differences in stock price comovements.

Abstract = {Are internal migrant workers who have contributed so much to
   contemporary Chinese economic growth forming a distinct, impoverished
   underclass (Chan, 2010; Solinger, 2006) or are they slowly merging into
   the Chinese working class? In this article sociological theory is
   employed to develop the distinction between underclass and working
   class, including the conditions and criteria that enable these social
   categories to be distinguished theoretically and empirically. Drawing on
   a large range of survey data, including our own analysis of a recent
   Chinese migrant worker survey, we examine relevant aspects of work and
   city experience in order to assess the underclass thesis. In addition,
   we evaluate the argument that younger migrant workers are significantly
   different in work orientation and strategies for work-life improvement
   compared with their more experienced counterparts. We conclude that
   evidence for the underclass thesis is less compelling than an
   interpretation that views most migrant workers as transitioning into the
   working class. In addition, although younger workers are more
   intrinsically oriented than older migrants, both groups concur that
   labor law enforcement is critical for work-life improvement while
   simultaneously developing their own collective capacity to influence
   labor relations outcomes.},

Abstract = {In this introduction to the special issue Changing work, labour and
   employment relations in China', we argue that China is taking an
   experimental and decentralized approach to the development of new labor
   relations frameworks. Particular political constraints in China prevent
   interest aggregation among workers, as the central state sees this as
   posing a risk to social stability. Firms and local governments have been
   given a degree of space to experiment with different arrangements, as
   long as the categorical ban on independent unions is not violated. The
   consequence has been an increasingly differentiated labor relations
   landscape, with significant variation by region and sector. We note some
   countervailing tendencies towards re-centralization, but emphasize that
   this phenomenon remains largely confined to the municipal level. The
   five articles in this special issue address different aspects of both
   experimentation and decentralization in labor relations.},

   the relative success of groups in managing their forest commons. Leaders
   who emphasize equality and efficiency see positive forest outcomes.
   Antisocial leaders, who punish indiscriminately, see relatively negative
   forest outcomes. Our results highlight the importance of leaders in
   collective action, and more generally the idiosyncratic but powerful
   roles that leaders may play, leading to substantial variation in group

Abstract = {The distinction of macro- and microfoundations of institutions implies a
   multilevel conceptualization of institutional processes. We adopt the
   evaluators' perspective on legitimacy to develop a multilevel theory of
   the legitimacy process under ideal-type conditions of institutional
   stability and institutional change, and we explore the dynamics of
   institutional change-from destabilization of the institutional order to
   return to stability in legitimacy judgments expressed by evaluators. We
   argue that through the process of institutionalization, legitimacy
   judgments of evaluators are subjected to social control and describe an
   institutional stability loop-a cross-level positive-feedback process
   that ensures persistence of legitimacy judgments and stability of the
   institutional order. Viewing institutional stability as a state of
   suppressed microlevel diversity, we draw researchers' attention to
   ``silenced{''} legitimacy judgments and to judgment suppressor factors
   that induce evaluators to abstain from making their deviant judgments
   public. The removal of such factors leads to the (re)emergence of
   competing judgments in public communications and creates an opportunity
   for institutional change. We explore competitive strategies that address
   propriety or validity components of legitimacy and describe the process
   through which organizational fields return to a state of institutional
   stability.},

Year = {2015},
Volume = {32},
Number = {4},
Pages = {4-39},
Abstract = {Despite numerous testimonials of first movers, the underlying mechanisms
   of organizations' big data analytics (BDA) usage deserves close
   investigation. Our study addresses two essential research questions: (1)
   How does organizational BDA usage affect value creation? and (2) What
   are key antecedents of organizational-level BDA usage? We draw on
   dynamic capabilities theory to conceptualize BDA use as a unique
   information processing capability that brings competitive advantage to
   organizations. Furthermore, we employ the
   technology-organization-environment (TOE) framework to identify and
   theorize paths via which factors influence the actual usage of BDA.
   Survey data collected from 161 U.S.-based companies show that:
   organizational-level BDA usage affects organizational value creation;
   the degree to which BDA usage influences such creation is moderated by
   environmental dynamism; technological factors directly influence
   organizational BDA usage; and organizational and environmental factors
   indirectly influence organizational BDA usage through top management
   support. Collectively, these findings provide a theory-based
   understanding of the impacts and antecedents of organizational BDA
   usage, while also providing guidance regarding what managers should
   expect from usage of this rapidly emerging technology.},

Title = {Organized hypocrisy, organizational facades, and sustainability
   reporting},
Journal = {ACCOUNTING ORGANIZATIONS AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {40},

Abstract = {Sustainability discourse is becoming ubiquitous. Still, a significant
   gap persists between corporate sustainability talk and practice. Prior
   research on corporate sustainability reporting has relied primarily on
   two competing theoretical framings, signaling theory and legitimacy
   theory, which often produce contradictory results regarding the
   significance and effects of such disclosures. Thus, despite this
   substantial body of research, the role that sustainability disclosures
   can play in any transition toward a less unsustainable society remains
   unclear. In an effort to advance our collective understanding of
   voluntary corporate sustainability reporting, we propose a richer and
   more nuanced theoretical lens by drawing on prior work in organized
   hypocrisy (Brunsson, 1989) and organizational facades (Abrahamson \&
   Baumard, 2008; Nystrom \& Strabuck, 1984). We argue that contradictory
   societal and institutional pressures, in essence, require organizations
   to engage in hypocrisy and develop facades, thereby severely limiting
   the prospects that sustainability reports will ever evolve into
   substantive disclosures. To illustrate the use of these theoretical
   concepts, we employ them to examine the talk, decisions, and actions of
   two highly visible U.S.-based multinational oil and gas corporations
   during the time period of significant national debate over oil
   exploration in the Alaskan National Wildlife Refuge. We conclude that
   the concepts of organizational facade and organized hypocrisy are
   beneficial to the sustainability disclosure literature because they
   provide theoretical space to more formally acknowledge and incorporate
   how the prevailing economic system and conflicting stake-holder demands
   constrain the action choices of individual corporations. (C) 2014

   organizational ethnography},
Journal = {HUMAN RELATIONS},

Volume = {68},
Number = {1},
Pages = {55-78},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {While organizational ethnographers have embraced the concept of
   self-reflexivity, problems remain. In this article we argue that the
   prevalent assumption that self-reflexivity is the sole responsibility of
   the individual researcher limits its scope for understanding
   organizations. To address this, we propose an innovative method of
   collective reflection that is inspired by ideas from cultural and
   feminist anthropology. The value of this method is illustrated through
   an analysis of two ethnographic case studies, involving a pair
   interview' method. This collective approach surfaced self-reflexive
   accounts, in which aspects of the research encounter that still tend to
   be downplayed within organizational ethnographies, including emotion,
   intersubjectivity and the operation of power dynamics, were allowed to
   emerge. The approach also facilitated a second contribution through the
   conceptualization of organizational ethnography as a unique endeavour
   that represents a collision between one world of work': the university,
   with a second: the researched organization. We find that this collision'
   exacerbates the emotionality of ethnographic research, highlighting the
   refusal of researched' organizations to be domesticated by the specific
   norms of academia. Our article concludes by drawing out implications for
   the practice of self-reflexivity within organizational ethnography.},

Title = {Thumbs Up, Sales Up? The Contingent Effect of Facebook Likes on Sales
   Performance in Social Commerce},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEMS},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {32},
Number = {4},
Pages = {109-143},
Abstract = {In this study we investigate whether social reference systems, such as
   Facebook ``likes{''} (FBLs), promote sales in social commerce, wherein
   adverse selection and quality uncertainty often severely damage consumer
   trust and impede efforts to achieve sustainable growth. We also examine
   the extent to which product characteristics (product uncertainty and
   product franchising) and deal characteristics (tipping points, discount
   rates, and deal durations) moderate the social selling stimulated by
   FBLs. On the basis of 1,327 samples collected from a major social
   commerce platform provider, we identify several interesting empirical
   regularities regarding the relationship between FBLs and social commerce
   sales. The findings suggest that FBLs drive traffic and increase sales.
   Information technology artifacts and social technologies, such as FBLs,
   can endow a consumer's shopping experience with a socialization
   component and induce social selling in collective buying platforms.
   Nevertheless, significant variations occur across products and deals.
   For example, consumers who purchase experience goods more frequently
   depend on FBLs than do those who buy search goods. FBLs exert a far
   greater influence on the sales of goods from independent stores than
   those from franchise chains. Social commerce consumers are unaffected by
   heavy discount rates as they make purchase decisions, but they
   extensively rely on FBLs, particularly when purchasing products that
   have low tipping points. Our results suggest that social commerce can be
   a powerful marketplace when the economic utility that is driven by price
   incentives is further strengthened and protected by the social utility
   that originates from trust and sharing.},

Abstract = {In this paper we combine work on rhetorical strategies with that of
   organizational identity theory. We highlight the relationship between
   organizational identity and the deployment of discursive resources at
   the societal level by organizations seeking to influence such
   identities. We analyse the way in which an extreme right political
   organization, the Vlaams Belang, has used rhetorical framing and
   strategies to construct a collective identity. This framing is aimed at
   persuading potential supporters of the organization to identify
   themselves with it. We argue that these frames derive their
   characteristic form and power from broader social and political
   processes that are given insufficient attention in published work on
   identity in organizations. We discuss the implications of our study for
   organizational theory, particularly the political and ethical questions
   raised by the use of potentially manipulative strategies. We conclude
   with a discussion of the ethical problems that arise when an
   organization's managers attempt to direct identity formation by
   exploiting a persistent desire for stability and continuity in a world
   where it becomes ever more elusive.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF BUSINESS VENTURING},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {30},
Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {150-166},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {This paper implements a qualitative, narrative approach to investigate
   entrepreneurs' personal experience of stigma associated with venture
   failure. Findings draw on the lived experience of 12 entrepreneurs and
   tell a collective story of how stigma affects entrepreneurs, shapes
   their actions, and engenders outcomes for them and their ventures. The
   story covers three episodes of entrepreneurs anticipating, meeting, and
   then transforming venture failure. Overall the paper shifts the focus of
   stigma research from the socio-cultural perspective pervading research
   to date, to micro-level processes underlying socio-cultural trends.
   Findings offer unexpected insights into failure stigmatization. First,
   findings suggest stigmatization is best viewed as a process that unfolds
   over time rather than a label. Second, this process begins before, not
   after, failure and contributes to venture demise. Third, there is a
   positive ending to the collective story in that stigmatization
   ultimately triggers epiphanies or deep personal insights which transform
   entrepreneurs' view of failure from a very negative to a positive life
   experience. This transformation results in entrepreneurs distributing
   learning from failure to the founding of future ventures, even when
   ventures are not their own. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Year = {2015},
Volume = {30},
Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {1-10},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {This article applies inductive analytic techniques to identify and
   elaborate on two recurring themes that underpin the core puzzle of
   entrepreneurship research where entrepreneurial opportunities come from.
   The first theme is the unique role of imprinting, or the profound
   influence of social and historical context in constraining the
   perceptual apparatus of entrepreneurs and delimiting the range of
   opportunities for innovation available to them. Second, our analysis
   offers insight into the counterbalancing role of reflexivity, operating
   at both individual and collective levels of analysis, in generating the
   ability of entrepreneurs to overcome the constraints of imprinting.
   These insights are based on a thematic review of the nine studies that
   comprise this special issue on qualitative research. The nine studies,
   individually and each in their own way, offer key insights into how we
   might better understand the emergence of entrepreneurial opportunity.

   the determinants of project success and motivations of developers in
   joining these projects are not well understood. Based on organizational
   theory, we propose that OSS activities of patch development and feature
   request can be classified as exploitation (implementation-oriented) and
   exploration (innovation-oriented) activities, respectively. We
   empirically examine how the structure of social network affects the
   success of patch-development and feature-request networks in OSS
   projects, using a data set collected from the SourceForge database. Our
   results provide empirical support for the view that patch development
   and feature request are exploitation and exploration activities,
   respectively. Network structures differ due to team formation
   differences and have a differential impact on development success based
   on the type of activity. The concepts of ambidextrous developers and
   ambidexterity are explored in the context of OSS projects. Collectively,
   our results indicate that studying OSS projects at the artifact level
   could improve our understanding of OSS project success and team
   formation. This, in turn, could lead to better management of OSS
   projects.},

Abstract = {In 2009, the SEC mandated that financial statements be filed using
   eXtensible Business Reporting Language (XBRL). The SEC contends that
   this new search-facilitating technology will reduce informational
   barriers that separate smaller, less-sophisticated investors from
   larger, more-sophisticated investors, thereby reducing information
   asymmetry. However, if some larger investors can leverage their superior
   resources and abilities to garner greater benefits from XBRL than
   smaller investors, information asymmetry is likely to increase. Using a
   difference-in-difference design, we find evidence of higher abnormal
   bid-ask spreads for XBRL adopting firms around 10-K filings in the year
   after the mandate, consistent with increased concerns of adverse
   selection. We also find a reduction in abnormal liquidity and a decrease
   in abnormal trading volume, particularly for small trades. Additional
   analyses suggest, however, that these effects may be declining somewhat
   in more recent years. Collectively, our evidence suggests that a
   reduction in investors' data aggregation costs may not have served its
   intended purpose of leveling the informational playing field, at least
   during the initial years after mandatory adoption.},

Year = {2014},
Volume = {41},
Number = {4},
Pages = {995-1014},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {From outrage at corporations to excitement about innovations,
   marketplace sentiments are powerful forces in consumer culture that
   transform markets. This article develops a preliminary theory of
   marketplace sentiments. Defined as collectively shared emotional
   dispositions, sentiments can be grouped into three function-based
   categories: contempt for villains, concern for victims, and celebration
   of heroes. Marketplace actors such as activists, brands, and consumers
   have a variety of motives and methods for producing and reproducing
   sentiments. Activists plant, amplify, and hyper-perform sentiments to
   recruit consumers and discipline institutions. Brands carefully select,
   calibrate, and broadcast sentiments to entertain consumers and promote
   products. Consumers learn, experience, and communicate sentiments to
   commune and individuate in society. The emergent theory of marketplace
   sentiments (1) advances a sociocultural perspective on consumer emotion,
   (2) elevates the theoretical significance of emotional observations in
   cultural studies, (3) offers a sentiment-based understanding of the
   power of ideology, (4) indicates how activist sentiments can
   paradoxically benefit from brand co-optation, and (5) calls for human
   input in big data sentiment analysis. More broadly, the article proposes
   that cultures are systems of discourses, sentiments, and practices
   wherein discourses legitimize sentiments and practices, sentiments
   energize discourses and practices, and practices materialize discourses
   and sentiments.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEMS},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {31},
Number = {3},
Pages = {7-34},
Month = {WIN},
Abstract = {Despite the potential of health information technology (HIT) systems to
   significantly reduce medical errors, streamline clinical processes,
   contain healthcare costs, and ultimately improve the quality of
   healthcare, their adoption by hospitals in the United States has been
   rather slow. To study this adoption process and get insights into the
   underlying mechanisms, in this work we synthesize the theories on social
   networks and knowledge transfer. We propose a research framework in
   which the absorptive capacity of a potential adopter and the collective
   disseminative capacity of connected adopters act as two key determinants
   of knowledge transfer in a socioeconomic network, and these two
   capacities substitute for each other in affecting HIT adoption. We also
   propose that, in a network setting, the mechanism of knowledge transfer
   manifests quite differently from that of social contagion in its impact
   on the diffusion process at different stages of adoption. Using a large
   longitudinal data set covering adoption decisions of more than five
   thousand hospitals across a thirteen-year horizon, we find strong
   support for our hypotheses. Our analysis shows that knowledge flow in
   provider networks plays a key role in fostering technology diffusion in
   initial years, allowing the contagion effect to set in sooner for
   quicker adoption in later years. Therefore, recent efforts at multiple
   levels to form integrated healthcare delivery networks should accelerate
   HIT adoption.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEMS},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {31},

Pages = {172-212},

Abstract = {Online policy deliberation forums (OPDFs) have been increasingly
   initiated by governments to allow citizens to provide their input and
   discuss policy issues. Yet, failure to garner participation, in terms of
   both quantity and quality, prevents the realization of their benefits.
   In this regard, prior research has suggested different antecedents for
   the quantity and quality of participation in online forums, but without
   systematically considering their differences. To address this research
   gap, in this study we develop a theoretical model to explain the
   antecedents of quantity and quality of OPDF participation and test the
   model using a survey and content analysis of forum logs. The results
   indicate that quantity of participation is enhanced by the
   information-technology-enabled resource factor of communality but
   negatively influenced by collective incentives. In contrast, the
   antecedents of the quality of participation include both motivational
   and resource factors. Furthermore, communality accentuates the perceived
   collective incentives and persuasion benefit of participation. This
   study contributes to the research by proposing and testing a theoretical
   model that explains the different antecedents of the quantity and
   quality of participation in OPDFs. More broadly, the findings inform
   research and practice on how outcomes of web-enabled cocreation, such as
   those generated through OPDF participation, can be evaluated and
   enhanced in these online communities.},

Abstract = {Although a firm's innovation performance has been commonly attributed to
   its innovative capability, in a study of 102 Chinese automobile
   assemblers, we find that employees' collective motivation for new
   product development (NPD) is more important than NPD capability in
   determining firms' innovation performance. This finding suggests that
   researchers need to simultaneously consider both unit-level capability
   and unit-level motivation in studying the mechanisms that drive
   innovation. Furthermore, our results indicate that a firm's strategic
   orientation focusing on NPD affects its employees' collective NPD
   motivation and NPD capability through relevant, mediating HRM practices.

Abstract = {We recently introduced a research program on how firms can effectively
   capture fleeting opportunities using heuristics. Heuristics, we
   advocate, are the essence of strategy, especially in unpredictable
   markets where opportunities are often numerous, fast moving, and
   uncertain. Our emphasis on heuristics invites comparison with prominent
   research programs in cognitive psychology. We address this opportunity
   by comparing our simple rules heuristics approach with
   heuristics-and-biases and fast-and-frugal heuristics research.
   Collectively, the three approaches offer a rich understanding of
   heuristics. Copyright (c) 2014 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Abstract = {This research examines the comparative effects of production manager and
   worker turnover in service and manufacturing settings. We suggest that,
   due to the centrality of human action in services and the ability of
   manufacturers to insulate the technical core, service and manufacturing
   companies are differentially dependent on and impacted by the loss of
   production manager and worker knowledge. The results from a survey of
   150 service and manufacturing firms provide partial support for this
   notion and show that turnover impacts these organizations differently.
   More specifically, we find that: (1) the negative impact of production
   worker turnover on firm performance is greater in service settings than
   in manufacturing settings; and (2) the negative impact of production
   worker turnover on firm performance is greater than the impact of
   production manager turnover in service firms. In addition, our findings
   show that organizational capital moderates the turnover-performance
   relationship for production workers in service firms.},

Number = {6},
Pages = {1316-1334},
Month = {NOV-DEC},
Abstract = {This paper studies a cooperative game of inventory transshipment among
   multiple firms. In this game, firms first make their inventory decisions
   independently and then decide collectively how to transship excess
   inventories to satisfy unmet demands. In modeling transshipment, we use
   networks of firms as the primitive, which offer a richer representation
   of relationships among firms by taking the coalitions used in all
   previous studies as special cases. For any given cooperative network, we
   construct a dual price allocation under which the network is stable for
   any residual demands and supplies in the sense that no firms find it
   more profitable to form subnetworks. Under the allocation based on the
   marginal contribution of each firm to its network (called the MJW
   value), we show that various network structures such as complete,
   hub-spoke, and chain networks are stable only under certain conditions
   on residual amounts. Moreover, these conditions differ across network
   structures, implying that a network structure plays an important role in
   establishing the stability of a decentralized transshipment system.
   Finally, we consider the case when firms establish networks
   endogenously, and show that pairwise Nash stable networks underperform
   the corresponding networks in centralized systems.},

Title = {A Meta-Analysis of the Relationship Between General Mental Ability and

Journal = {JOURNAL OF APPLIED PSYCHOLOGY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {99},
Number = {6},
Pages = {1222-1243},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Although one of the most well-established research findings in
   industrial-organizational psychology is that general mental ability
   (GMA) is a strong and generalizable predictor of job performance, this
   meta-analytically derived conclusion is based largely on measures of
   task or overall performance. The primary purpose of this study is to
   address a void in the research literature by conducting a meta-analysis
   to determine the direction and magnitude of the correlation of GMA with
   2 dimensions of nontask performance: counterproductive work behaviors
   (CWB) and organizational citizenship behaviors (OCB). Overall, the
   results show that the true-score correlation between GMA and CWB is
   essentially 0 (-.02, k = 35), although rating source of CWB moderates
   this relationship. The true-score correlation between GMA and OCB is
   positive but modest in magnitude (. 23, k = 43). The 2nd purpose of this
   study is to conduct meta-analytic relative weight analyses to determine
   the relative importance of GMA and the five-factor model (FFM) of
   personality traits in predicting nontask and task performance criteria.
   Results indicate that, collectively, the FFM traits are substantially
   more important for CWB than GMA, that the FFM traits are roughly equal
   in importance to GMA for OCB, and that GMA is substantially more
   important for task and overall job performance than the FFM traits.
   Implications of these findings for the development of optimal selection
   systems and the development of comprehensive theories of job performance
   are discussed along with study limitation and future research
   directions.},

Abstract = {This paper focuses on women leaders' self-views as women and leaders and
   explores consequences of positive social identity (i.e., positive
   evaluation of the social category in question) for women in leadership
   positions. We hypothesized that holding positive gender and leader
   identities reduced perceived conflict between women's gender and leader
   identities and thereby resulted in favorable psychological and
   motivational consequences. Studies 1 and 2 revealed that positive gender
   identity indeed reduced women leaders' identity conflict. In Study 3, we
   found that by lessening identity conflict, positive gender identity
   reduced stress, increased life satisfaction, and caused women to
   construe leading more as an attractive goal than a duty. In contrast,
   positive leader identity directly affected women's motivation to lead,
   but did not reduce their identity conflict. Overall, these results
   emphasize the protective role of women's positive gender identity for
   their advancement in organizations and leader identity development. (C)

Abstract = {Greenwood, Hinings and Whetten (2014) present two major criticisms of
   current institutional scholarship, and see need for a broad redirection:
   institutional organization theory, they argue, has lost sight of the
   claim to study organizations and, with its overwhelming focus on
   isomorphism and similarity, has fallen short on adequately theorizing
   differences across organizations. In our article, we offer support as
   well as a riposte. First, while we agree that the organizing of
   collective efforts needs to be at the core of organization research, we
   warn that focusing on formal organization - a rationalized cultural
   product itself - may direct attention away from studying alternative
   modes of organizing, and underestimates the dynamic developments that
   have transformed contemporary organizations into increasingly complex
   objects of inquiry. Second, we are concerned that, by abandoning the
   analysis of similarities in favour of differences, institutional theory
   may eventually lose sight of its pivotal quest: to study institutions.},

Abstract = {This paper proposes a theoretically grounded definition of indecision
   and considers one of indecision's potential functions. It argues that,
   despite a reputation as mere choice pathology, indecision may play an
   important role in identity formation and maintenance. In particular, the
   contemplations and conversations characteristic of indecision may help
   construct, discover, or affirm who one is, even if ostensibly they are
   intended only to clarify what one should do. In addition to positing an
   underexplored function of indecision, the possibility that indecision
   facilitates identity development suggests that concentrated identity
   work need not be an explicit objective or even a process of which one is
   cognizant; it can be an unwitting byproduct of frustrated attempts at
   choice. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Title = {The Subjective Well-Being Political Paradox: Happy Welfare States and
   Unhappy Liberals},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF APPLIED PSYCHOLOGY},

Volume = {99},

Abstract = {Political scientists traditionally have analyzed the effect of politics
   on subjective well-being (SWB) at the collective level, finding that
   more liberal countries report greater SWB. Conversely, psychologists
   have focused primarily on SWB at the individual level and shown that
   being more conservative corresponds in greater SWB. We integrate the
   theoretical foundations of these 2 literatures (e. g., livability and
   system justification theories) to compare and contrast the effects of
   country-and individual-level political orientation on SWB
   simultaneously. Using a panel of 16 West European countries
   representative of 1,134,384 individuals from 1970 to 2002, we
   demonstrated this SWB political paradox: More liberal countries and more
   conservative individuals had higher levels of SWB. More important, we
   explored measurement as a moderator of the political orientation-SWB
   relationship to shed some light on why this paradox exists. When
   orientation is measured in terms of enacted values (i.e., what the
   government actually does), liberalism corresponds in higher SWB, but
   when politics is measured in terms of espoused values (i.e., what
   individuals believe), greater conservatism coincided in higher SWB.},

Abstract = {This study of the U.S. wind energy industry extends theory on the
   process of industry emergence by developing and testing a coevolutionary
   model of the relationship between social movement organizations (SMOs),
   institutions, and industries. Building on research that suggests that
   SMOs can influence institutions and the path of emerging industries, we
   show that the growth of an industry can also influence the diversity of
   social movements by motivating the participation of specialist SMOs.
   These new SMOs in turn deploy distinct knowledge, capabilities, goals,
   and strategies to produce institutional changes that are necessary for
   the continued growth of the industry. Our study offers a more complete
   conceptualization of the influence of social movements on industry
   emergence and growth, and it extends understanding of how SMO diversity
   is produced.},

Volume = {25},
Number = {6},

Month = {NOV-DEC},
Abstract = {We examine how emerging organizations acquire shape by drawing on
   multiple organizational forms, a process we call organizational
   bricolage. Studying Indymedia London, a grassroots media collective, we
   propose a grounded theory of organizational bricolage that identifies
   how various types of organizational forms are selected and how they are
   instantiated into the organization. Whereas extant research has
   emphasized imprinting as a primary mechanism shaping newly founded
   organizations, we point to the additional role of organizational values.
   Emerging organizations augment their imprinted forms by using ancillary
   forms aligned with their organizational values and reinforce their core
   features by differentiating themselves from antagonistic forms that
   conflict with their values. We contribute to the literature on
   organizational formation by developing a process model that details how
   imprinted forms are subsequently modified. Moreover, we extend theories
   of bricolage by specifying the limits to the relative arbitrariness of
   bricolage as an activity, and we contribute to the study of
   organizational values by suggesting that they act as a focusing device
   shaping organizational structure.},

   more than the rate of return to public capital. In other words, social

Abstract = {This article presents two separate but closely related studies. We used
   a first sample to investigate the relationships among individuals'
   reports of their income and their subjective well-being, and their
   approval of unethical behavior in 27 countries and a second sample to
   investigate the relationship between corruption in 55 countries and
   their populace's aggregated feelings of subjective well-being
   (happiness). Analysis of data from 27,762 working professionals showed
   that, although reported feelings of subjective well-being were
   negatively related to their approval of unethical behaviors, income was
   positively related to their approval of unethical behaviors. In
   addition, the effects for feelings of subjective well-being were
   particularly strong for high-income people. Analyses also showed that,
   after controlling for economic development and other country-level
   factors, corruption was negatively related to a country's feelings of
   happiness. These findings suggest that feelings of subjective well-being
   may lead to more ethical, less corrupt behavior and that the tolerance
   of unethical, corrupt behavior may lead to less collective happiness and
   subjective well-being.},

   survey evidence indicates that product users are perhaps the most

   the benefits are greatest in new technology areas and in the generation

Abstract = {The globalization of state-owned multinational companies (SOMNCs) has
   become an important phenomenon in international business (IB), yet it
   has received scant attention in the literature. We explain how the
   analysis of SOMNCs can help advance the literature by extending our
   understanding of state-owned firms (SOEs) and multinational companies
   (MNCs) in at least two ways. First, we cross-fertilize the IB and SOEs
   literatures in their analysis of foreign investment behavior and
   introduce two arguments: the extraterritoriality argument, which helps
   explain how the MNC dimension of SOMNCs extends the SOE literature, and
   the non-business internationalization argument, which helps explain how
   the SOE dimension of SOMNCs extends the MNC literature. Second, we
   analyze how the study of SOMNCs can help develop new insights of
   theories of firm behavior. In this respect, we introduce five arguments:
   the triple agency conflict argument in agency theory; the owner risk
   argument in transaction costs economics; the advantage and disadvantage
   of ownership argument in the resource-based view (RBV); the power escape
   argument in resource dependence theory; and the illegitimate ownership

Abstract = {I develop a model linking specific microinteraction dynamics between
   members of different institutional fields and the genesis of new
   practices. The model centers on the concept of interstitial spaces that
   is, small-scale settings where individuals from different fields
   interact occasionally and informally around common activities to which
   they devote limited time (e.g., hobbyist clubs, hangouts, workshops,
   meet-ups). I argue that the features of interstitial spaces (e.g., their
   institutional diversity and their occasional and informal nature)
   facilitate the individuals interacting in these settings to temporarily
   break free from existing institutions and experiment collectively with
   new activities and ideas. However, these very same features hinder the
   constitution of such new activities and ideas into new practices. I
   identify two microlevel conditions that enable the new activities and
   ideas developed in interstitial spaces to be constituted into new
   practices: the emergence of successful interaction rituals, and the
   presence of catalysts sustaining others' interactions and assisting the
   construction of shared meanings.},

Title = {The Constitutive Role of Conventions in Accomplishing Coordination:
   Insights from a Complex Contract Award Project},
Journal = {ORGANIZATION STUDIES},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {35},
Number = {10},
Pages = {1473-1505},

Abstract = {This article advances understanding of how coordination is accomplished
   in organizations. It builds on and extends recent research, which
   suggests that coordination is an emergent process of situated
   interaction aiming to realize a collective performance. In particular,
   the paper focuses on deliberate efforts to coordinate and contribute to
   objectives of large-scale integration in practice (e.g., orchestrated,
   year-long delivery of a megaproject). Such efforts give rise to a novel
   form of interdependencies, which organizational actors experience as
   external to local activities and group interactions. Drawing on recent
   developments in social theory, the paper proposes a framework to study
   coordinative action in situations where organizational actors are faced
   with a multitude of task-specific and external interdependencies.
   Further, through an in-depth study of a contract award project, it sheds
   light on the ways ongoing project coordination was adjusted to address
   interdependencies arising from the deliberate pursuit of two objectives:
   the concerted delivery of a construction megaproject and the large-scale
   procurement policy coordination targeted at safeguarding market
   competition across the European Union. Findings highlight that the
   situated management of external interdependencies entailed a distinctive
   type of agency, mediated by formalized industry-wide and policy
   conventions, and concerned with developing relevant evidence of
   coordinated contributions. The article explains how and why actors may
   adjust coordination efforts by alternating between coordination modes.
   Implications are drawn for studying coordination dynamics in other
   organizational settings},

Title = {Trust, Trustworthiness, and Information Sharing in Supply Chains
   Bridging China and the United States},
Journal = {MANAGEMENT SCIENCE},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {60},
Number = {10},
Pages = {2435-2460},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Whether and how trust and trustworthiness differ between a collectivist
   society, e. g., China, and an individualistic one, e. g., the United
   States, generates much ongoing scientific debate and bears significant
   practical values for managing cross-country transactions. We
   experimentally investigate how supply chain members' countries of
   origin-China versus the United States-affect trust, trustworthiness, and
   strategic information sharing behavior in a cross-country supply chain.
   We consider a two-tier supply chain in which the upstream supplier
   solicits demand forecast information from the retailer to plan
   production; but the retailer has an incentive to manipulate her forecast
   to ensure abundant supply. The levels of trust and trustworthiness in
   the supply chain and supplier's capability to determine the optimal
   production quantity affect the efficacy of forecast sharing and the
   resulting profits. We develop an experimental design to disentangle
   these three aspects and to allow for real-time interactions between
   geographically distant and culturally heterogeneous participants. We
   observe that, when there is no prospect for long-term interactions, our
   Chinese participants consistently exhibit lower spontaneous trust and
   trustworthiness than their U. S. counterparts do. We quantify the
   differences in trust and trustworthiness between the two countries, and
   the resulting impact on supply chain efficiency. We also show that
   Chinese individuals exhibit higher spontaneous trust toward U. S.
   partners than Chinese ones, primarily because they perceive that
   individuals from the United States are more trusting and trustworthy in
   general. This positive perception toward U. S. people is indeed
   consistent with the U. S. participants' behavior in forecast sharing. In
   addition, we quantify that a Chinese supply chain enjoys a larger
   efficiency gain from repeated interactions than a U. S. one does, as the
   prospect of building a long-term relationship successfully sustains
   trust and trustworthiness by Chinese partners. We advocate that
   companies can reinforce the positive perception of westerners held by
   the Chinese population and commit to long-term relationships to
   encourage trust by Chinese partners. Finally, we also observe that both
   populations exhibit similar pull-to-center bias when solving a decision
   problem under uncertainty (i.e., the newsvendor problem).

   climate, the collective perceptions employees hold regarding abusive
   supervision in their work unit. We thereby extend research on abusive
   supervision to the team level, which allows us to explore its
   relationship with outcomes not addressed by individual-level theories of
   abuse. First, we explain the emergence of abusive supervision climate
   through the lens of social information processing theory. Then, drawing
   on team process and effectiveness models, we develop a
   multiple-mediation model that identifies two distinct mechanisms by
   which abusive supervision climate impacts group-level outcomes: social
   identity and collective efficacy. Results demonstrate that abusive
   supervision climate influences social- and task-related group outcomes
   through these two mediation processes.},

Abstract = {We empirically examine the association between downstream firms', i.e.,

   market information quality is measured by the customers' provision of
   earnings forecasts, the customers' reported earnings quality, and the
   customers' coverage by financial analysts and credit rating agencies. We
   hypothesize and find a positive association between customers' capital
   market information quality and suppliers' operating performance measured
   by the DuPont profitability ratios. The association is stronger for
   suppliers with higher sales volatility, no order backlogs, customers who
   are less dependent on their input, and shorter business relation with
   customers. Collectively, the results suggest that the quality of
   information provided by the customers to the capital market has a
   spillover effect in the input market, i.e., helps the suppliers improve

Abstract = {This study documents a six-fold increase in short-term return reversals
   during earnings announcements relative to non-announcement periods.
   Following prior research, we use reversals as a proxy for expected
   returns market makers demand for providing liquidity. Our findings
   highlight significant time-series variation in the magnitude of
   short-term return reversals and suggest that market makers demand higher
   expected returns prior to earnings announcements because of increased
   inventory risks that stem from holding net positions through the release
   of anticipated earnings news. Collectively, our findings suggest that
   uncertainty regarding anticipated information events elicits predictable
   increases in the compensation demanded for providing liquidity and that
   these increases significantly affect the dynamics and information
   content of market prices. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Taken-for-granted cognitive schemas form a core aspect of institutions.
   Whilst much is known about their effects, past research has not yet
   detailed and formalized how individual actors are able to initiate
   changes to such institutionalized schemas, reframe their circumstances
   and how, in turn, such a provisional reframing may itself evolve into a
   taken-for-granted schema. In this article, we argue that changes to
   existing institutions come about when actors engage in discursive
   processes of frame shifting or frame blending by which they articulate
   alternative or combined schematizations and succeed in building up
   common ground around the novel cognitive template. We elaborate a set of
   propositional arguments for when and how actors are more likely to
   initiate and realize institutional change by either discursively marking
   the contrast with prior cognitive schemas or by scaling these up into a
   broader understanding.},

Title = {Founding Teams as Carriers of Competing Logics: When Institutional
   Forces Predict Banks' Risk Exposure},
Journal = {ADMINISTRATIVE SCIENCE QUARTERLY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {59},
Number = {3},
Pages = {442-473},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Through archival data from 225 local banks founded between 2006 and
   2009, as well as interviews with 73 bank founders, this paper explores
   the influence of founders' institutional logics, specifically financial
   and community logics, on the degree of risk taking in the organizations
   they found. Local bank founders steeped in a financial logic see the
   bank as an investment vehicle and seek to maximize profits, while those
   motivated by a community logic are driven to meet community needs and
   focus less on profits. Despite demands from regulators and consultants
   that promote uniformity of operations, variation exists in banks' risk
   strategies that seems connected to values and taken-for-granted
   predispositions inherent in such institutional logics. But such a
   connection is empirically demonstrated only in banks with larger
   founding teams. In those, increased internal representation of a
   financial logic is associated with higher use of risky deposit
   instruments to finance rapid asset growth, while a higher representation
   of a community logic is associated with lower use of such risky
   instruments. Furthering research on hybrid organizations that combine
   competing logics, this paper suggests that individuals are more likely
   to be the carriers of institutional influences especially when operating
   collectively in larger teams, in which one expects more group conformity
   and diffusion of responsibility. In smaller teams, individual discretion
   is more likely to dominate institutional forces.},

Abstract = {The experience of simultaneously positive and negative orientations
   toward a person, goal, task, idea, and such appears to be quite common
   in organizations, but it is poorly understood. We develop a multilevel
   perspective on ambivalence in organizations that demonstrates how this
   phenomenon is integral to certain cognitive and emotional processes and
   important outcomes. Specifically, we discuss the organizational triggers
   of ambivalence and the cognitive and emotional mechanisms through which
   ambivalence diffuses between the individual and collective levels of
   analysis. We offer an integrative framework of major responses to highly
   intense ambivalence (avoidance, domination, compromise, and holism) that
   is applicable to actors at the individual and collective levels. The
   positive and negative outcomes associated with each response, and the
   conditions under which each is most effective, are explored. Although
   ambivalence is uncomfortable for actors, it has the potential to foster
   growth in the actor as well as highly adaptive and effective behavior.},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Current research has identified five discrete US negotiation tactics, a
   traditional one considered to be ethical, and four considered to be
   ethically questionable. Scholars have independently used culture to
   explain how the endorsement of these five negotiation tactics varies
   across nations. They have also independently used interpersonal trust
   and ethics propensity to explain antecedents of the endorsement of those
   five negotiation tactics. This research combines all those variables
   into one model that investigates the influence of horizontal and
   vertical individualism-collectivism, ethical idealism, and trust
   propensity on employees' attitudes toward ethically questionable
   negotiation tactics in Israel and Kyrgyzstan. A survey questionnaire was
   translated from English to Hebrew and Kyrgyz, and 615 responses were
   collected from employees in various industries in the two countries. We
   empirically confirmed three types of questionable negotiation tactics
   discovered in previous one-nation studies, namely, pretending,
   deceiving, and lying. Vertical individualism was found to be positively,
   and horizontal collectivism was found to be negatively, related to
   pretending, deceiving, and lying. Ethical idealism was found to be
   negatively related to the endorsement of the lying tactics, while trust
   propensity was negatively related to the pretending tactics. Compared
   with Israel, employees' endorsement of ethically questionable
   negotiation tactics was significantly higher in Kyrgyzstan. Contribution
   to theory and practice is discussed.},

Abstract = {Entrepreneurial ventures need frequently to adapt. Yet their adaptive
   capacity is often limited by the legacies of imprinted founding
   characteristics. The question then arises whether it is possible to
   explain and manage the imprinting process so that the capacity to adapt
   is enhanced, rather than diminished. I address this question by
   developing a model of the microfoundations of imprinting based in
   collective memory. I argue that entrepreneurial founding teams naturally
   develop transactive autobiographical memory systems. By partially
   managing the design and imprinting of these memory systems, I argue that
   founders may improve their venture's long-term capacity to adapt.},

Abstract = {How do we, as management researchers, develop novel theoretical
   contributions and, thereby, potentially break new ground in management
   studies? To address this question, we review previous methodological
   work on theorizing and advance a typology of the reasoning processes
   that underlie theoretical contributions and significant advances in
   management studies. This typology consists of various types of
   analogical and counterfactual reasoning, ranging from focused thought
   experiments aimed at prodding existing theory in the direction of
   alternative assumptions, constructs, and hypotheses to more expansive
   efforts for inducing new theoretical models and alternative
   explanations. Applying this typology, we detail the mechanisms behind
   the formation of novel theoretical contributions and illustrate the
   currency of our typology through a review of 24 major theoretical
   breakthroughs in management studies. We conclude the paper by discussing
   the implications of this typology for our collective efforts in
   building, elaborating, and expanding theory in management studies.},

   approach, as this methodology has been shown to be particularly
   effective at uncovering the collective cognitive maps on which
   executives' decisions and behaviors are based. Executives identified a
   broad set of 37 strategic concepts that they felt distinguish the sales
   force efforts of directly competing companies. A second set of sales
   executives classified the 37 concepts into capabilities, resources, and
   organizational context concepts. Based on the classification results and
   feedback from both sets of executives, we developed research
   propositions for examining sales force strategy and provide directions

Journal = {JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ETHICS},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {123},
Number = {3},
Pages = {461-473},

Abstract = {Codes of conduct are the main tools to privately regulate worker rights
   in global value chains. Scholars have shown that while codes may improve
   outcome standards (such as occupational health and safety), they have
   had limited impact on process rights (such as freedom of association and
   collective bargaining). Scholars have, though, only provided vague or
   general explanations for this empirical finding. We address this
   shortcoming by providing a holistic and detailed explanation, and argue
   that codes, in their current form, have limited impact on trade union
   rights due to (i) buyers paying lip service to trade union rights, (ii)
   workers being treated as passive objects of regulation in codes of
   conduct, (iii) auditing being unable to detect and remediate violations
   of trade union rights, (iv) codes emphasizing parallel means of
   organizing, (v) suppliers having limited incentives for compliance, and
   (vi) codes being unable to open up space for union organizing when
   leveraged in grassroots struggles. Our arguments suggest that there is
   no quick fix for codes' limited impact on trade union rights, and that
   codes, in their current form, have limited potential to improve trade
   union rights. We conclude by discussing ways in which codes of conduct,
   and private regulation of worker rights more generally, could be
   transformed to more effectively address trade union rights.},

   80 percent of these articles have been published since January 2011 and
   almost all cite the work of Orlikowski (2007, 2010; Orlikowski and Scott
   2008) as the source of the concept. Only a few, however, address all of
   the notions that Orlikowski suggests are entailed in sociomateriality,
   namely materiality, inseparability, relationality, performativity, and
   practices, with many employing the concept quite selectively. The
   contribution of sociomateriality to these literatures is, therefore,
   still unclear. Drawing on evidence from an ongoing study of the adoption
   of a computer-based clinical information system in a hospital critical
   care unit, this paper explores whether the notions, individually and
   collectively, offer a distinctive and coherent account of the
   relationship between the social and the material that may be useful in
   Information Systems research. It is argued that if sociomateriality is
   to be more than simply a label for research employing a number of
   loosely related existing theoretical approaches, then studies employing
   the concept need to pay greater attention to the notions entailed in it
   and to differences in their interpretation.},

Abstract = {Cross-sector development partnerships (CSDPs) are project-based
   collaborative arrangements between business, government, and civil
   society organizations in support of international development goals such
   as sustainability, health education, and economic development. Focusing
   on public private partnerships in development cooperation, we examine
   different constellations of bridging agents and their effects in the
   formation of single CSDP projects and longer-term alliances. We
   conceptualize bridging agency as a collective process involving both
   internal partner representatives and external intermediaries in
   initiating and/or supporting roles. We find that the involvement of
   external intermediaries eases the formation of single projects and
   longer-term alliances. However, when projects are initiated by external
   intermediaries they tend to be repetitive and narrow in scope, whereas
   projects initiated by internal partner representatives often explore
   novel agendas and embody a greater potential for social innovation. Yet,
   the longer-term pursuit of these agendas beyond single projects may
   require external intermediaries in supporting roles. Findings help
   better understand micro-processes and collective practices of brokerage
   and alliance formation in transnational governance contexts and beyond.},

Abstract = {We document that a stock's price around a recommendation or forecast
   covaries with prices of other stocks the issuing analyst covers. The
   effect of shared analyst coverage on stock price comovement extends
   beyond analyst activity days. A stock's daily returns covary with the
   returns of other stocks with which it shares analyst coverage. These
   links between stock price comovement and shared analyst coverage are
   consistent with the coverage-specific information we find in earnings
   forecasts; analysts who cover both stocks in a pair expect future
   earnings of the stocks to be more highly correlated than do analysts who
   cover only one stock from the pair. Collectively, our evidence indicates
   that analyst research produces coverage-specific spillovers that raise
   price comovement among stocks that share analyst coverage. The strength
   of these spillovers is comparable to spillovers from broad industry and
   market information in analyst research.},

Title = {Meaning Making by Managers: Corporate Discourse on Environment and
   Sustainability in India},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ETHICS},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {123},
Number = {3},
Pages = {493-511},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The globally generated concepts of environment and sustainability are
   fast gaining currency in international business discourse.
   Sustainability concerns are concurrently becoming significant to
   business planning around corporate social responsibility and integral to
   organizational strategies toward enhancing shareholder value. The
   mindset of corporate managers is a key factor in determining company
   approaches to sustainability. But what do corporate managers understand
   by sustainability? Our study explores discursive meaning negotiation
   surrounding the concepts of environment and sustainability within
   business discourse. The study is based on qualitative interpretive
   research drawing from symbolic interactionism (Blumer, Symbolic
   interactionism: perspective and method. Prentice-Hall, Englewood Cliffs,
   1969) which postulates that meaning in discourse is an essentially
   contested domain dependent upon negotiation in the Habermasian tradition
   of mutually respectful dialogue (Habermas, The theory of communicative
   action: lifeworld and system: a critique of functionalist reason. Beacon
   Press, Boston 1987). Data from semi-structured intensive interviews of a
   small sample of senior corporate managers was analyzed to examine how
   corporate elites in India frame their approach to sustainability issues
   and respond to external pressures for deeper corporate responsibility.
   The findings point to the existence of a distinctively local narrative
   with strong potential for the discursive negotiation of personal and
   collective understanding of ethical and socio-cultural values that may
   help internalize broader sustainability considerations into corporate
   decision-making processes.},

   theorize that rather than having a linear association, the performance
   benefits of team efficacy reach a point of inflection, reflective of too
   much of a good thing. Further, in an effort to establish a boundary
   condition of the inverted-U shaped relationship we predict, we also test
   the moderating role played by team goal monitoring in the nonmonotonic
   relationship between team efficacy and team performance. The results
   from a lagged field test, in which we collect multisource data from 153
   technology sales teams, reveal a significant curvilinear association
   that is moderated by team goal monitoring behavior. Implications for
   theory and practice are discussed.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF MARKETING},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {78},
Number = {5},
Pages = {78-98},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {International relationships are increasingly critical to business
   performance. Yet despite a recent surge in international research on
   relationship marketing (RM), it is unclear whether or how RM should be
   adapted across cultures. The authors adopt Hofstede's dimensions of
   culture to conduct a comprehensive, multivariate, metaregression
   analysis of 47,864 relationships across 170 studies, 36 countries, and
   six continents. To guide theory, they propose four tenets that
   parsimoniously capture the essence of culture's effects on RM. Study 1
   affirms these tenets and emphasizes the importance of taking a
   fine-grained perspective to understand the role of culture in RM because
   of the high degree of heterogeneity across different cultural dimensions
   and RM linkages. For example, the magnitude of individualism's effect is
   71\% greater on RM than other cultural dimensions, whereas masculinity
   has almost no effect; however, accounting only for individualism ignores
   significant moderating effects of power distance and uncertainty
   avoidance dimensions. To guide managers, Study 2 adopts a country-level
   approach and reveals that RM is much more effective outside the United
   States such that relationships are 55\% more effective, on average, for
   increasing business performance in Brazil, Russia, India, and China.},

Volume = {59},

Abstract = {To examine the transition from a planned to a market economy in China,
   this study uses census data from China's National Bureau of Statistics
   from 1998-2006 to investigate multi-population dynamics across the three
   main organizational forms in China's domestic sector: state-owned
   enterprises (SOEs), collectively owned enterprises (COEs), and privately
   owned enterprises (POEs). We conceptualize economic transition as a
   community-level change from an old, dominant organizational form (SOE),
   through a transitional form (COE), to a new form (POE). When the new
   organizational form conflicts with the prevailing identity codes
   represented by the old form, the transitional form-which has identity
   overlap with both the new and old forms-performs the critical tasks of
   transferring legitimacy to the new form and supporting its survival and
   proliferation. Our analysis showed that, though the existence of
   state-owned enterprises increased the exit rate of privately owned
   enterprises, collectively owned enterprises provided legitimation for
   privately owned enterprises. Meanwhile, privately owned enterprises
   crowded out both state-owned enterprises and collectively owned
   enterprises. We contribute to ecology theory by extending research that
   typically depicts a two-population scenario. Our framework accommodates
   cross-effects involving three organizational forms: old, transitional,
   and new.},

Abstract = {Business leadership increasingly requires a master's degree in business
   and graduate management admission test (GMAT) scores continue to be an
   important component of applications for admission to such programs.
   Given the ubiquitous use of GMAT scores as gatekeepers for business
   leadership, GMAT scores are likely to influence organizational ethical
   behavior through gender, cultural, and other biases in the GMAT. There
   is little prior literature in this area and we contribute by empirically
   documenting that GMAT scores are negatively related to the cultural
   dimensions of masculinity and power distance and are positively related
   to math literacy, uncertainty avoidance, and individualism. We estimate
   that cultural factors may account for as much as an 80-point difference
   in cross-national mean GMAT scores which are also related negatively to
   local language literacy, national educational spending, wealth per
   capita, wealth inequality, and gender development. Most interestingly,
   we also find a significant negative association of GMAT scores with
   ethical orientation. These findings have important implications for
   business schools and corporate ethics and leadership.},

Title = {WHY DO COOPERATIVES EMERGE IN A WORLD DOMINATED BY CORPORATIONS? THE

Abstract = {Given the strong economic disincentives that exist, why do cooperatives
   continue to emerge? And why is it that, in some communities, these
   cooperatives are collocated with their commercial counterparts, yet, in
   others, territorial partitioning occurs? In this paper, we develop a
   community ecology approach that integrates economic and sociological
   accounts of cooperatives, in an attempt to reconcile these contradictory
   observations. Using a detailed panel data set for the county-level
   founding process of cooperatives in the U.S. ethanol industry from 1978
   to 2013, consistent with rational economic arguments, we find that the
   founding rate of cooperatives decreases in the presence of high, local,
   corporate ethanol production capacity. However, this negative
   competitive interdependence is attenuated in local communities where:
   (1) corporations represent a potential threat to the autonomy of local
   farmers, (2) there is a generally anti-corporate climate, and (3) there
   is a well-established organizational infrastructure supporting a
   cooperative ideology. Consistent with sociological theories that
   emphasize the mobilizing force of ideology, these local conditions spur
   and facilitate collective action among farmers to establish cooperatives
   in response to the local diffusion of corporations. We show further that
   the diffusion of plants owned by big business (oil and agribusiness) in
   communities characterized by a general anti-corporate climate especially
   promotes greater ideological contestation and the mobilization of
   resources to form cooperatives.},

Abstract = {Using Robert Merton's perspective on social structure {[}Social theory
   and structure. Free Press, New York, 1968], this study tested the
   individual-level association between job position and ethical reasoning.
   Anomie theory was employed to examine how country-level factors moderate
   that individual-level association. The hierarchical linear modeling
   (HLM) method was used to analyze 22,359 subjects from 28 nations. The
   statistical results proved that workers are more likely to justify
   ethically suspect behaviors, and that this individual-level relationship
   is moderated by the country-level factors of power distance,
   masculinity, social inequality, and education accessibility. These
   results imply that Merton's view of social structure and contemporary
   anomie theorists' perspective of anomie {[}Messner and Rosenfeld (Crime
   and the American dream. Wadsworth, Belmont, 2001); Rosenfeld and Messner
   (The future of anomie theory. Northeastern University Press, Boston,

Abstract = {This study examines the role of within-team competition (i.e. team
   hypercompetition and team development competition) in a team process. We
   developed and tested a model that associates team collectivism as the
   antecedent of within-team competition, and knowledge sharing and team
   flexibility as the outcomes. The model was empirically tested with data
   from 141 knowledge-intensive teams. The empirical findings showed that
   team collectivism had a positive relationship with team development
   competition and a negative relationship with team hypercompetition.
   Regarding the outcomes, team development competition and team
   hypercompetition had an indirect relationship with knowledge sharing and
   team flexibility through team empowerment. We offer a number of original
   contributions to the team effectiveness literature, especially by
   showing that team hypercompetition and team development competition have
   different impacts on team knowledge sharing and team flexibility.},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Drawing on recent critical debates concerning the ontology of
   leadership, this article outlines a radical rethinking of the concept -
   not as the study of heroic individuals, skilled practitioners,
   collaborators or discursive actors - but as the marker of a fundamental
   and productive lack; a space of absent presence through which individual
   and collective desires for leadership are given expression. Where
   current critical debates tend to oscillate between variants of the
   physical and the social in their analyses, this article considers the
   potential for a negative ontology of leadership; one in which absence,
   ideological practices and the operation of empty signifiers form the
   basis for empirical investigation and critical reflection.},

   making models accessible to a broad audience, whereas backstage
   interactions in protected spaces allow models to be deconstructed. Our
   findings show that the interplay between front stage and backstage
   enables the refraining of institutional models by refining the
   constituent practices, which neutralizes opposition and facilitates
   joint courses of action. Our results contrast with popular accounts of
   competing institutional logics, advance organizational research on the

Abstract = {Could power distance, which is the extent that inequality is expected
   and accepted, explain why some countries and consumers are more likely
   to engage in prosocial behavior, including donations of both money and
   time? This research proposes that higher power distance results in
   weaker perceptions of responsibility to aid others, which decreases
   charitable behavior. Both correlational and causal evidence is provided
   in a series of five studies that examine country-level power distance as
   well as individual and temporarily salient power distance belief.
   Consistent with the mediating role of perceived responsibility, results
   reveal that uncontrollable needs and communal relationship norms are
   boundary conditions that overcome the negative effect of power distance
   on charitable behavior. These results explain differences in charitable
   giving across cultures and provide implications for nonprofit

Abstract = {In this paper, we seek to understand how individuals, as part of a
   collective, commit themselves to a single, and possibly erroneous,
   frame, as a basis for sensemaking and coordinated actions. Using
   real-time data from an anti-terrorist police operation that led to the
   accidental shooting of an innocent civilian, we analyse how individual
   actors framed their circumstances in communication with one another and
   how this affected their subsequent interpretations and actions as events
   unfolded. Our analysis reveals, first, how the collective commitment to
   a framing of a civilian as a terrorist suicide bomber was built up and
   reinforced across episodes of collective sensemaking. Second, we
   elaborate on how the interaction between verbal communication, expressed
   and felt emotions, and material cues led to a contraction of meaning.
   This contraction stabilized and reinforced the overall framing at the
   exclusion of alternative interpretations. With our study we extend prior
   sensemaking research on environmental enactment and the escalation of
   commitment and elaborate on the role of emotions and materiality as part
   of sensemaking.},

Abstract = {Power distance is a value that differentiates individuals, groups,
   organizations, and nations based on the degree to which inequalities are
   accepted either as unavoidable or as functional. Understanding power
   distance is especially important in organizational research because
   power is fundamental to all relationships, is inherent in hierarchical
   organizations, and affects many organizational processes and outcomes.
   We begin by reviewing existing value taxonomies and definitional
   elements of power distance. Next, we review theories and research
   linking power distance to micro and macro work-related outcomes. We
   conclude by identifying areas where additional organizational research
   on power distance is needed and, in doing so, provide an agenda for
   future research in this area. Our review highlights power distance as an
   important explanatory variable and boundary condition for many relations
   that organizational ( not just cross-cultural) scientists examine.},

Abstract = {This article provides insight into how some groups achieve extraordinary
   levels of creativity by reconsidering the collective process through
   which new ideas develop. Previous research has been premised on a model
   in which idea generation stimulated by divergent input increases the
   variance in ideas a group generates and therefore increases the chance
   that one of the group's ideas will be a radical, breakthrough creative
   product. In contrast, I present a dialectical model in which the
   integration of group members' perspectives (which I label creative
   synthesis) is the foundation for new ideas. I propose that the process
   of creative synthesis improves the chance that each of a group's ideas
   is a breakthrough. I elaborate the process facilitators of creative
   synthesis and the implications of the dialectical model for
   understanding extraordinary group creativity. Creative synthesis
   provides an alternative way for groups to combine their cognitive,
   social, and environmental resources into extraordinary output.},

Abstract = {This study investigates the impact of a human resource management (HRM)
   system, which integrates both content and process of human resource (HR)
   practices, on organizational performance, through collective employee
   reactions. The analysis is based on a sample of 1,250 Greek employees
   working in 133 public- and private-sector organizations, which operate
   in the present context of severe financial and economic crises. The
   findings of the structural equation modeling suggest that content and
   process are two inseparable faces of an HRM system that help to reveal a
   comprehensive picture of the HRM-organizational performance
   relationship. Based on the findings that collective employee reactions
   mediate the HRM content (i.e., organizational performance relationship)
   and HRM process moderates the HRM content (i.e., employee reactions
   relationship), the study has several theoretical and practice
   implications. (C) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

Title = {Oppositional Identities and Resource Partitioning: Distillery Ownership
   in Scotch Whisky, 1826-2009},
Journal = {ORGANIZATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {25},
Number = {4},
Pages = {1272-1286},
Month = {JUL-AUG},
Abstract = {We build on recent theory and research on the role of categories in
   resource partitioning. We analyze Scotch whisky making between 1826 and
   2009-a case that seemed initially to fail to conform to the pattern of
   the beer industry now treated as prototypical. On close examination
   (both qualitative and quantitative), we find that high concentration in
   the center of the market is not sufficient to generate a partition.
   Rather, we see a long delay between the heightening of concentration in
   the industry and the emergence of a cluster of peripheral producers that
   claim an identity in opposition to the dominant generalists. We explain
   the source of the delay as a function of the nature of the audience,
   which until recently did not regard conglomerate or foreign ownership of
   distilleries as an impediment to producing authentic whisky. Only when
   critics started to question how ownership of distilleries related to
   authenticity did the revival of the traditional form of ownership begin
   to occur. By analyzing entries of focused firms in the recent period, we
   find that widespread ownership of distilleries of diversified
   corporations (but not foreign ownership) supported the formation of more
   traditional types of whisky distillers. But endurance of identity-based
   resource partitioning might require development of a collective identity
   and collective strategy by producers. In the case we studied, each
   focused producer has an idiosyncratic identity, which may be
   insufficient to cause audiences to agree on a code that excludes the
   mainstream producers from membership in the new category and thereby
   maintain a partitioned market.},

Abstract = {Information elaboration enables functionally diverse teams to transform
   their breadth of knowledge resources into actionable solutions to

   theory and research in two ways. First, we identify how team ability and
   social motivation composition characteristics provide the psychological
   origins of complex information processing efforts. Second, we identify
   environmental turbulence as an important boundary condition, clarifying
   when information elaboration benefits team performance and when it does
   not. These ideas were tested in a sample of 4-person self-managed teams
   (N= 68) which were functionally diverse and performed a cooperative
   strategic decision-making task. Results indicate that cognitive ability
   equips teams with the ``can do{''} ability for complex elaboration
   efforts through emergent team mental models, whereas low preferences for
   self-reliance provide the ``will do{''} motivation for in-depth
   information exchange through collective leadership. In turn, teams
   benefited from information elaboration in turbulent but not stable

Abstract = {W e draw from research on emotions and moral reasoning to develop a

   emotions in the spread of corruption within organizations. Our focus on
   a well-intentioned and deliberative path to corruption is a departure
   from previous theory, which has focused on mindless and ill-intentioned
   paths. In our model, moral emotions play a critical role in both the
   initial recruitment of a target individual (the direct process), as well
   as the spread of corruption to a broader group of nontargeted
   individuals through emotional contagion (the vicarious process). For
   both processes we explain how self-directed moral emotions (guilt,
   shame, embarrassment, and pride) facilitate the spread of corruption and
   how other-directed moral emotions (anger and contempt) do not. We
   conclude by discussing the implications of our theory and directions for

Title = {An Image of Who We Might Become: Vision Communication, Possible Selves,
   and Vision Pursuit},
Journal = {ORGANIZATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {25},
Number = {4},
Pages = {1172-1194},
Month = {JUL-AUG},
Abstract = {We propose a model of vision communication that emphasizes the mediating
   role of follower collective possible selves-that is, self-conception in
   terms of what the collective (team, organization) which one is a member
   of may become in the future that can be held by individuals but can also
   be shared by multiple individuals. Our model is the first to provide an
   integrative account of how vision communication may stimulate the
   pursuit of the vision by individuals and collectives, and it complements
   and extends prior research in three important ways. First, in contrast
   to an earlier emphasis on the role of individual perceptions of the
   current self, our model puts perceptions of the future self at the
   forefront. It captures how vision communication can invite social
   sharedness of these perceptions, thus doing justice to visions' nature
   as images of a future for the collective. Second, in contrast to earlier
   work on vision communication focusing on general indicators of
   leadership effectiveness, our model puts what is arguably the most
   important outcome for vision communication center stage: vision pursuit,
   the followers' actions aimed at making the vision reality. We argue that
   the creation of collective possible selves by followers is crucial for
   vision communication because collective possible selves explain how
   vision communication relates to vision pursuit. Third, our model also
   addresses aspects of vision communication that may facilitate the
   processes through which visions become internalized as possible selves,
   and it captures the processes through which such possible selves become
   shared among members of a collective and lead to collective vision
   pursuit.},

Abstract = {This study tests the effects of top management team (TMT) member
   collectivistic values and TMT dissatisfaction with the financial
   situation on the environmental ethics of TMT members. We also examine
   the moderating effect of collectivistic values on the relationship
   between financial dissatisfaction and environmental ethics. Analyses of
   multi-level and source data show that financial dissatisfaction of the
   TMT negatively affects TMT members' environmental ethics. However, TMT
   members' individual collectivism can increase TMT members' environmental
   ethics. Analyses also show that TMT members' collectivism moderates the
   relationship between financial dissatisfaction and environmental ethics
   across individual and team levels.},

Abstract = {Technology platform strategies offer a novel way to orchestrate a rich
   portfolio of contributions made by the many independent actors who form
   an ecosystem of heterogeneous complementors around a stable platform
   core. This form of organising has been successfully used in smartphone,
   gaming, commercial software, and industrial sectors. Technology
   ecosystems require stability and homogeneity to leverage common
   investments in standard components, but they also need variability and
   heterogeneity to meet evolving market demand. Although the required
   balance between stability and evolvability in the ecosystem has been
   addressed conceptually in the literature, we have less understanding of
   its underlying mechanics or appropriate governance. Through an extensive
   case study of a business software ecosystem consisting of a major
   multinational manufacturer of enterprise resource planning software at
   the core and a heterogeneous system of independent implementation
   partners and solution developers on the periphery, our research
   identifies three salient tensions that characterize the ecosystem:
   standard-variety, control-autonomy, and collective-individual. We then
   highlight the specific ecosystem governance mechanisms designed to
   simultaneously manage desirable and undesirable variance across each
   tension. Paradoxical tensions may manifest as dualities, where tensions
   are framed as complementary and mutually enabling. Alternatively, they
   may manifest as dualisms, where actors are faced with contradictory and
   disabling ``either ... or{''} decisions. We identify conditions where
   latent, complementary tensions become manifest as salient, contradictory
   tensions. By identifying conditions in which complementary logics are
   overshadowed by contradictory logics, our study further contributes to
   the understanding of the dynamics of technology ecosystems, as well as
   the effective design of technology ecosystem governance that can
   explicitly embrace paradoxical tensions toward generative outcomes.},

   of Children's Early Employment Intensity},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ETHICS},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {122},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Considerable interest has long existed in two separate phenomena of
   considerable social interest, namely children's early exposure to
   employment outside of any organizational, legislative, or collective
   bargaining protection, and teenage smoking. We used data from a large
   national survey to address possible direct and indirect links between
   children's early employment intensity and smoking (both intent and
   history) because of significant long-term implications of the link
   between work and well-being in a vulnerable population. Fifth to ninth
   grade children's (N = 19,018) informal employment intensity (number of
   odd jobs) was related to both smoking history and smoking intent, and
   these effects were partially mediated by the amount of weekly spending
   money and self-esteem. The number of one's parents and friends who smoke
   separately moderated the relationships between self-esteem and weekly
   spending money, and smoking behavior. These findings illustrate the
   complex consequences of young children's exposure to early employment,
   and emphasize the need for research on the ethical implications of pre-
   and early teenagers who are employed outside of the formal employment
   context.},

Abstract = {This research examines the interplay of self-construal orientation and
   victim group-membership on prosocial behavior. Whereas consumers primed
   with an independent self-construal demonstrate similar propensities to
   help needy in-group and out-group others, an interdependent orientation
   fosters stronger commitments to aid in-group than out-group members.
   This interaction holds in both individualistic (i.e., the United States)
   and collectivistic (i.e., China) nations and seems driven by a belief
   system. For interdependents, the prospect of helping needy in-group
   (relative to out-group) members heightens the belief that helping others
   contributes to their own personal happiness, which in turn increases
   their propensity to act benevolently. Such in-group/out-group
   distinctions do not seem to operate among independents. The article
   concludes by discussing the theoretical implications of our findings for
   the cross-cultural, intergroup-relations, and prosocial literatures
   before deriving insights for practice.},

   Analysis},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ETHICS},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {122},
Number = {2},
Pages = {343-359},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Current literature on ethical leadership and unethical leadership
   reflects a Western-based private sector perspective, pointing toward a
   compliance-oriented understanding of ethical and unethical leadership.
   As today's executives increasingly have to ethically lead across
   different cultures and sectors, it becomes vitally important to develop
   a more holistic picture how ethical and unethical leadership is
   perceived in the Western and Eastern cultural cluster and the private
   and the public/social sector. Addressing this issue, the present study
   aims to identify cross-cultural and cross-sectoral commonalities and
   differences in international executives' perceptions of ethical and
   unethical leadership. Findings from in-depth interviews (N = 36) with
   executives from Western and Eastern cultures working in the private or
   the public/social sector reveal collectively held perceptions of ethical
   leadership (including leader honesty, integrity, concern for
   responsibility/sustainability, and people orientation) and of unethical
   leadership (referring to leader dishonesty, corruption, egocentrism, and
   manipulation). Results indicate limited support for a
   compliance-oriented perspective on ethical and unethical leadership but
   yield a much greater trend toward a value-oriented perspective. Concrete
   practice examples illustrate these different perspectives. Cultural and
   sectoral particularities of executive perceptions of ethical and
   unethical leadership are discussed.},

Abstract = {How can leaders build an organization that is capable of innovating
   continually over time? By creating a community that is both willing and
   able to innovate.
   To be willing, the community must share a sense of purpose, values, and
   rules of engagement. When Luca de Meo was Volkswagen's head of marketing
   communication, he fostered a sense of purpose in his team by asking its
   members to reflect on what being part of VW meant to them; strengthened
   their shared values by encouraging them to use the brand's three
   components innovation; responsibility, and value to guide their work;
   and built significant responsibility and autonomy into their rules of
   engagement.
   To be able, companies must generate ideas through discourse and debate;
   experiment quickly, reflect, and adjust; and make decisions that combine
   disparate and even opposing ideas. Bill Coughran, an SVP of engineering
   at Google, employed these capabilities both to solve the company's
   near-term data storage needs and to make progress toward a
   next-generation solution.},

Abstract = {Is the societal-level of analysis sufficient today to understand the
   values of those in the global workforce? Or are individual-level
   analyses more appropriate for assessing the influence of values on
   ethical behaviors across country workforces? Using multi-level analyses
   for a 48-society sample, we test the utility of both the societal-level
   and individual-level dimensions of collectivism and individualism values
   for predicting ethical behaviors of business professionals. Our
   values-based behavioral analysis indicates that values at the
   individual-level make a more significant contribution to explaining
   variance in ethical behaviors than do values at the societal-level.
   Implicitly, our findings question the soundness of using societal-level
   values measures. Implications for international business research are
   discussed.},

Abstract = {We argue that financial analysts can be viewed as participants of two
   tournaments (the ``All-Star{''} tournament and the intrafirm tournament)
   and examine whether analysts are incentivized by the tournament
   compensation structure. Using data from 1991 to 2007, we find that
   interim losers are more likely to increase the boldness of their
   forecasts in the remainder of the tournament period than interim
   winners. This finding survives several robustness checks and is more
   pronounced when the interim assessment date is closer to the end of the
   tournament period, when analysts are inexperienced, and when the market
   activity is high. In addition, we show that interim losers' changes in
   boldness are less informative than interim winners'. Collectively, our
   findings suggest that viewing financial analysts as participants of
   tournaments provides a useful framework for understanding analysts'
   behavior.},

Abstract = {In a growing economy, investing in safe projects raises
   intergenerational inequalities. This deteriorates social welfare because
   of inequality aversion, as expressed by decreasing marginal utility of
   consumption. The social discount rate can be interpreted as the minimum
   rate of return that is necessary to compensate for the increased
   inequality generated by the investment. For an intuitive precautionary
   argument, this growth effect is reduced if growth is uncertain. To
   complete the picture, if the investment raises the collective risk, this
   discount rate should also contain a risk premium. Recent developments
   (Weitzman 1998, 2001, 2013; Gollier 2008; Arrow et al. 2013) converge
   toward recommending using a smaller discount rate for safe assets
   maturing later. In this paper, I show that this recommendation applied
   to the risk-free rate relies on the assumption that shocks on the growth
   rate of consumption exhibit some degree of persistence. I also show that
   this implies in parallel an increasing term structure for the risk
   premium. Globally, the risk-adjusted discount rate will have a
   decreasing term structure only if the asset's beta is small enough.},

Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Prior research has shown that differential access to debt markets
   significantly affects capital structure. In this paper, we examine the
   effect of access to debt markets on investment decisions by using debt
   ratings to indicate bond market access. We find that rated firms are
   more likely to undertake acquisitions than nonrated firms. This finding
   remains even after accounting for firm characteristics, for the
   probability of being rated, and in matched sample analysis as well as in
   subsamples based on leverage, firm size, age and information opacity.
   Rated firms also pay higher premiums for their targets and receive less
   favorable market reaction to their acquisition announcements relative to
   nonrated firms. However, the average announcement returns to rated
   acquirers are non-negative. Collectively, these findings suggest that
   the lack of debt market access has a real effect on the ability to make
   investments as well as on the quality of these investments by creating
   underinvestment, instead of simply constraining overinvestment. (C) 2014

Title = {Which model of capitalism best delivers both wealth and equality?},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS STUDIES},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {45},
Number = {4},
Pages = {363-386},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Capitalism is the dominant economic system adopted throughout the global
   economy, but there are many different models of capitalism practiced
   depending on what the society decides ``economic effectiveness{''} is.
   In this study, we assert that an effective economy simultaneously
   achieves two seemingly divergent outcomes: it (1) creates economic
   wealth efficiently, and (2) shares that wealth equitably. Employing
   insights from Whitley's national business systems framework and fuzzy
   set analysis, we examine how national institutions collectively
   configure with respect to the overall level of equitable wealth creation
   within 48 developed and developing economies. We find that three
   configurations are associated with relatively high levels of equitable
   wealth creation, and another three are associated with relatively low
   levels. As such, our analysis supports the notion of equifinality - that
   there is no one optimal model of capitalism. Furthermore, we begin to
   demonstrate that these models of capitalism are constantly evolving, but
   their evolution is generally slow even when considering the practice of
   capitalism before and after the 2008 global economic crisis. We discuss
   the implications of these findings for the study of international
   business, with a special emphasis on considering a more holistic context
   for exploring how multinational enterprises interact with their
   institutional environment(s).},

Volume = {43},
Number = {4},
Pages = {632-644},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {The open source software (OSS) movement thrives on innovation and
   volunteer effort of developers. Scholars have expressed widespread
   concern about the sustainability of the OSS movement due to high levels
   of volunteerism. In this paper, we address a central challenge to the
   sustainability of OSS-developers' acceptance of monetary rewards. We
   strive to explain why some OSS developers accept monetary rewards and
   others do not. Viewed through the theoretical lens of the
   private-collective innovation model (Von Hippel and Von Krogh, 2003,
   2006), this allows us to describe when developers will accept private
   financial rewards. Our main research objective is to clearly map the web
   of relationships between causal antecedents, and developers' acceptance
   behavior. Using a unique dataset that combines survey and behavioral
   measures, we find that - (a) intention to accept monetary rewards
   mediates the impact of motivational elements on developers' acceptance
   of monetary rewards; (b) intrinsic and extrinsic motivations positively
   affect their intention to accept monetary rewards, community motivation
   negatively impacts intention and ideological motivation does not affect
   the intention to accept rewards and (c) these effects are obtained even
   after inclusion of several control variables. The theoretical and
   managerial implications of our work are described. (C) 2013 Elsevier

Volume = {99},

Abstract = {Drawing upon the notion of managerial discretion from upper echelons
   theory, we theorize which external contingencies moderate the
   relationship between collective organizational citizenship behavior
   (COCB) and unit performance. Focusing on business unit (BU) management
   teams, we hypothesize that COCB of BU management teams enhances BU
   performance and that this impact depends on environmental uncertainty
   and BU management-team decision latitude, 2 determinants of managerial
   discretion. In particular, the positive effect of COCB is stronger when
   environmental uncertainty or the BU management-team decision latitude is
   greater. Time-lagged data from 109 BUs of a telecommunications company
   support the hypotheses. Additional exploratory analysis shows that the
   positive moderating effect of environmental uncertainty is further
   amplified at higher levels of BU management-team decision latitude.
   Overall, this study extends the internally focused view in the micro OCB
   literature by introducing external contingencies for the
   COCB-unit-performance relationship.},

Abstract = {Computer abuse (CA) by employees is a critical concern for managers.
   Misuse of an organization's information assets leads to costly damage to
   an organization's reputation, decreases in sales, and impositions of

   framework proffered by Thong and Yap (1998) to better understand the
   factors that lead individuals to commit CA in organizations. The study
   uses a survey of 449 respondents from the banking, financial, and
   insurance industries. Our results indicate that individuals who adhere
   to a formalist ethical perspective are significantly less likely to
   engage in CA activities than those following a utilitarian ethical
   framework. In addition, the results provide evidence that employees with
   individualistic natures are linked to increased CA incidents, whereas
   collectivist tendencies are associated with decreases in CA behaviors.
   Our results also show that collectivism acts as a strong moderator that
   further decreases the relationships between formalism and CA, and
   utilitarianism and CA. Finally, we offer detailed suggestions on how
   organizations and researchers can leverage our findings to decrease CA
   occurrences.},

Abstract = {In a departure from the historical focus on individual-level turnover,
   scholars have recently examined turnover at the collective level.
   Building on this work, we invoke human and social capital arguments and
   analyze the implications of varying rates of top management team (TMT)
   turnover for firm performance. Our principal finding is that TMT
   departures have deleterious effects on subsequent firm performance,
   though we find evidence to suggest that this effect is nonlinear.
   Results also suggest that higher levels of average organizational tenure
   of the TMT will modestly attenuate this negative effect. Contrary to
   arguments grounded in the managerial discretion literature,
   environmental munificence weakened the negative effects of TMT turnover
   rates on subsequent firm performance, whereas the hypothesized
   moderating effects for both industry complexity and instability were not

Abstract = {Despite broad debates surrounding how the human resource management
   occupation can increase its legitimacy, researchers have yet to examine
   the collective steps HR practitioners are taking in this regard and the
   extent to which they have been successful. We conduct a case study of
   the HR professionalization project in Canada via multisource qualitative
   and quantitative data, which we analyze using a unique integration of
   the trait and control models from the sociology of professions, as well
   as isomorphism from institutional theory. Viewed through the lens of
   these frameworks, we find that HR practitioners are attempting to
   emulate traits that define traditional notions of professions, and are
   aspiring to transcendent values associated with balancing the sometimes
   conflicting interests of employers and employees. Objective data from
   external stakeholders and institutions show that these collective
   strategies have been somewhat successful in garnering greater legitimacy
   thus far, particularly when comparisons are made with the HR
   professional project in the United States. We highlight numerous
   implications for future research and practice surrounding the legitimacy
   of the HR profession. (c) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

   Coherence in Product Innovation},
Journal = {ORGANIZATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {25},
Number = {3},
Pages = {691-712},

Abstract = {A recognized challenge in innovation scholarship is how to coordinate
   the efforts of many minds contributing to the design of a single
   artifact. Much research shows that product concept representations can
   help coordinate design tasks, but we know little about the practices
   that make representations more or less effective. We used an inductive
   approach to examine how six teams in three industries used concept
   representations when creating novel products. All six teams crafted
   three types of representations: stories, metaphors, and prototypes.
   However, merely using representations did not ensure a shared repertoire
   and concept coherence-a common understanding of desired product
   attributes. Teams that failed to consistently engage in three
   practices-(1) collective scrutiny of representations, (2) linking
   representations to design constraints, and (3) active editing of
   representations-produced concept disunity, with disparate understandings
   of desired product attributes. Teams that maintained concept coherence
   were better able to coordinate design tasks than teams that experienced
   concept disunity. Our research explains how the ultimate effect of
   concept representations on the coordination of innovation is contingent
   on the practices used to manage a repertoire of representations in use.},

Title = {Bracing for demand shocks: An experimental investigation},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {32},
Number = {4},
Pages = {205-216},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {We investigate inventory ordering decisions when decision makers
   anticipated a demand shock. Decision makers anticipating an event have
   been shown to brace for an uncertain negative outcome by overestimating
   the likelihood of that event. Decision makers faced with a spike in
   demand may incur increased holding costs because they may brace,
   exhibiting a judgment bias, and consequently a decision bias by
   over-ordering inventory. Three studies span conditions of uncertainty
   regarding the timing and magnitude of a demand shock: Employing three
   between-subjects experiments, Study 1 investigates behavior when
   decision makers were faced with uncertainty in timing and in magnitude
   of demand at the most elemental level, manipulating holding and stock
   out costs. The three experimental tasks feature uncertainty about the
   magnitude of demand (Experiment 1.1), uncertainty about the timing of
   demand (Experiment 1.2), and uncertainty about both the magnitude and
   timing of demand (Experiment 1.3). Study 2 uses a dynamic, multi-period
   replenishment task and a between-subjects manipulation regarding the
   uncertainty of timing and magnitude of a demand shock. Study 3 also
   employs a multi-period decision environment, but compares behavior under
   a demand shock condition with that in a condition featuring only random
   variability. The collective results from the three studies identify a
   bias toward over-ordering in response to a demand shock, relative to the
   optimal orders. The between-subjects manipulations in Study 2 points
   toward a possible remedy as we found that providing information
   concerning the timing and magnitude of a shock ameliorated the bias. The
   primary revelation was that decision makers had more difficulty dealing
   with uncertain timing than with uncertain magnitude of demand. One
   implication is that it is particularly critical for retailers to
   carefully plan and manage how they share information with upstream
   supply chain partners regarding when they plan to introduce store-level
   promotions. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {This paper develops relational pluralism as a collective construct whose
   dimensions are heterogeneity, multiplexity, and asymmetry. Relational
   pluralism is instantiated in the board of directors, whose network of
   relationships influence a new venture's ability to establish external
   links beyond the networks of the founding team. We argue that relational
   pluralism speeds the establishment of a diverse alliance portfolio,
   which, in turn, speeds the attainment of major revenue milestones in a
   new firm. We examine these ideas in a population of de novo
   semiconductor firms and find that diverse alliance portfolios emerge
   faster when a board includes members with heterogeneous, multiplex
   relationships, as well as central network positions. However, the
   asymmetric influence of outside board members can have both positive and
   negative effects: the alliance formation process is aided by outsiders
   in central network positions, but impeded when central investors
   dominate the board. We discuss implications for our understanding of
   relational pluralism as a collective construct.},

Abstract = {When thinking about the future, people often engage in affective
   forecasting predicting what it would feel like to experience a
   particular event. In this article we explore how a specific form of work
   ubiquitous in today's organizations project assignments provides cause
   to reconsider assumptions surrounding affective forecasting. To this
   end, we synthesize research on affective forecasting and theorize
   connections between affective forecasting and project success (versus
   failure), rooting our arguments in the claim that affective forecasting
   shapes a key motivation-related aspect of performance regulatory focus.
   Further, we account for systematic biases underlying affective
   forecasting and consider how organizational factors may shape the
   strength of these biases. Collectively, our arguments expand and, in
   some respects, challenge theory on affective forecasting and open new
   windows into the study of affect (i.e., mood and emotion) in

Abstract = {This paper builds on a growing literature that takes into account the
   fact that firms in an industry may be interdependent with regard to
   their corporate reputations, thus sharing a ``reputation commons.{''} We
   argue that the theory of public goods can help us to understand the
   interdependencies that link corporate reputations and to frame the
   contexts and requirements for collective action that they induce. In
   particular, we suggest that more and more frequently these
   interdependencies make industry reputation a ``weak link{''} public
   good. We show that this raises new challenges for the strategic
   management of industry reputation by communities of firms. The
   discussion of these challenges is based on the case study of the
   collective action of the European chlorine companies towards restoring
   their reputation after being accused of not being safe, and on a model
   of the production of reputation by companies. Copyright (c) 2013 John

Abstract = {Technological progress in an industry is enabled by the collective R\&D
   efforts of suppliers, users and research organizations. In this study,
   we explore how the pattern of R\&D collaboration within the industry
   community evolves over the technology life cycle. We propose that as the
   technology evolves from an initial emergence stage to subsequent stages
   of growth and maturity, there is a corresponding change in the
   opportunities and challenges confronting industry participants. This
   results in a shift not only in the relative propensities for internal
   and collaborative R\&D, but also in the distribution of the different
   types of collaborative interactions involving research organizations,
   suppliers and users. The context for the study is the global
   semiconductor manufacturing industry from 1990 to 2010. During this
   period, the industry experienced exponential technological progress that
   was fueled by the deep ultraviolet (DUV) manufacturing technology. We
   draw upon a comprehensive archival dataset of more than 12,000 articles
   presented in industry technical conferences to analyze the pattern of
   collaborative R\&D during the emergence, growth and maturity stages of
   the DUV technology. The observed trends in the semiconductor
   manufacturing industry point to intriguing shifts in the efforts and
   interactions among suppliers, users and research organizations as they
   collectively push the technology envelope forward. (C) 2013 Elsevier

Abstract = {Using the methodology of system dynamics, we model the effects of
   disruptive events on learning and productivity in organizations. We
   leverage the learning-by-doing and transactive memory system theories to
   model the underpinnings of learning processes at the collective and
   individual levels. We simulate the impact of disruptive events on
   organizational productivity and performance, such as employee turnover,
   technological innovation, reorganization, and extreme events (such as
   natural disasters), which disrupt individual knowledge, collective
   knowledge, or both. Finally, we discuss implications of our findings for
   future research on organizational learning and productivity. One
   implication is that representing organizational learning by a single
   power-law learning curve or even by multiple noninteracting learning
   curves may be in many cases inadequate. Another is that disruptions to
   individual learning can be beneficial to organizations in the long run,
   whereas disruptions to collective learning are detrimental in the short
   and long run. We discuss the factors that might help organizations
   mitigate the negative effects of disruption so that learning can occur
   amid even the most disruptive events.},

Abstract = {An integrative self-definition model is proposed to improve our
   understanding of how procedural justice affects different outcome
   modalities in organizational behavior. Specifically, it is examined
   whether the strength of different levels of self-definition (collective,
   relational, and individual) each uniquely interact with procedural
   justice to predict organizational, interpersonal, and job/task-oriented
   citizenship behaviors, respectively. Results from experimental and (both
   single and multisource) field data consistently revealed stronger
   procedural justice effects (1) on organizational-oriented citizenship
   behavior among those who define themselves strongly in terms of
   organizational characteristics, (2) on interpersonal-oriented
   citizenship behavior among those who define themselves strongly in terms
   of their interpersonal relationships, and (3) on job/task-oriented
   citizenship behavior among those who define themselves weakly in terms
   of their distinctiveness or uniqueness. We discuss the relevance of
   these results with respect to how employees can be motivated most
   effectively in organizational settings.},

Abstract = {In a broad cross-section of US firms, we document that the likelihood of
   a CEO's performance-related dismissal declines in his tenure. This
   finding is consistent with both firm performance revealing information
   about a CEO's uncertain executive ability and CEO tenure reflecting weak
   firm governance choices that reduce the likelihood of
   performance-related dismissal. In a sample of CEOs who begin their
   appointment during our sample period, we find evidence more broadly in
   favor of the former explanation. Specifically, we find that (1) CEO
   survival is associated with superior firm performance, (2) this relation
   is unaffected by firm governance choices, (3) the intensity with which a
   firm monitors its CEO declines over his tenure, and (4) firms'
   monitoring intensity increases following CEO turnover. Collectively, our
   results suggest that periodic performance reports increasingly resolve
   uncertainty regarding executive ability, thereby lowering firm owners'
   demand for monitoring their CEO over his tenure.},

Abstract = {Global supply chains are part of the corporate strategy of many
   multinational companies, often with adverse effects on labor conditions.
   While employment relations scholars focus on a production-oriented
   paradigm, revolving around interactions among employers, workers, and
   government, much of the activism motivating the development of private
   labor standards is based around companies' relations with their
   consumers. This article proposes an analytical framework conceptualizing
   the interface of employment relations and consumption relations within
   global supply chains, identifying four regimes of labor governance:
   governance gaps, collective bargaining, standards markets, and
   complementary regimes. Finally, we suggest a research agenda for
   examining the role of consumption relations in the changing nature of
   global labor governance. (c) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

Abstract = {We develop and test the construct of duty orientation that we propose is
   valuable to advancing knowledge about ethical behavior in organizations.
   Duty orientation represents an individual's volitional orientation to
   loyally serve and faithfully support other members of the group, to
   strive and sacrifice to accomplish the tasks and missions of the group,
   and to honor its codes and principles. We test the construct validity
   and predictive validity of a measure of duty orientation across five
   studies and six samples. Consistent with the conceptualization of duty
   orientation as a malleable construct, we found in separate field studies
   that duty orientation mediates the relationship between ethical
   leadership and ethical and unethical behaviors, and between
   transformational leadership and ethical behavior. In predicting ethical
   and unethical behavior, duty orientation demonstrated incremental
   predictive validity beyond the effects of affective organizational
   commitment, organizational identification, experienced job
   responsibility, collective self-construal, and organizational values
   congruence. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Volume = {38},

Pages = {187+},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Online user forums for technical support are being widely adopted by IT
   firms to supplement traditional customer support channels. Customers
   benefit from having an additional means of product support, while firms
   benefit by lowering the costs of supporting a large customer base.
   Typically these forums are populated with content generated by users,
   consisting of questioners (solution seekers) and solvers (solution
   providers). While questioners can be expected to keep returning as long
   as they can find answers, firms must employ different means in order to
   recognize and encourage the contributions of solvers. We identify and
   compare the impact of two widely adopted recognition mechanisms on the
   philanthropic behavior of solvers. In the first mechanism,
   feedback-based recognition, solver contribution is evaluated by
   questioners. In the second mechanism, quantity-based recognition, all
   contributions are weighted equally regardless of questioner feedback. We
   draw on the pro-social behavior literature to identify four drivers of
   solver contribution: (1) peer recognition, (2) image motivation, (3)
   social comparison, and (4) social exposure. We show that the choice of
   recognition mechanism strongly influences a solver's problem-solving
   behavior, highlighting the importance of the firm's decision in this
   regard. We address issues of solvers self-selecting a type of
   recognition mechanism by using propensity score analysis in order to
   show that solver behavior is a result of forum conditioning. We also
   study the impact of the recognition mechanism on forum quality and the
   effectiveness of support to draw comparative analytics.},

Abstract = {In this article we explore how assumptions about human nature may
   influence the ways one might try to promote ethical behavior in
   organizations. We summarize two common views of human nature in
   organizational research Homo economicus and Homo heuristicus. We then
   extend these views by putting forward a third view of human nature
   initially proposed by Emile Durkheim Homo duplex which describes human
   beings as moving back and forth between a lower (individual) and higher
   (collective) level. We suggest that the Homo duplex view is uniquely
   equipped to account for variables of interest to organizational scholars
   because of its attention to a fundamental tension: People in
   organizations can be both selfish and groupish, and the balance between
   those tendencies influences the ethical profile of the organization in
   complex ways. We end with a discussion of the theoretical implications
   of the Homo duplex view for behavioral ethics researchers. (C) 2013

   triggered a process of learning and sensemaking which led to spiralling
   cycles of role boundary expansion. In this process, facilitated by an
   enabling collective, actors not only changed their own self-concept
   (internal identity work) but also, through external identity work,
   changed others' conceptions of their institutionally prescribed roles.},

Title = {Humble Chief Executive Officers' Connections to Top Management Team
   Integration and Middle Managers' Responses},
Journal = {ADMINISTRATIVE SCIENCE QUARTERLY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {59},
Number = {1},
Pages = {34-72},

Abstract = {In this article, we examine the concept of humility among chief
   executive officers (CEOs) and the process through which it is connected
   to integration in the top management team (TMT) and middle managers'
   responses. We develop and validate a comprehensive measure of humility
   using multiple samples and then test a multilevel model of how CEOs'
   humility links to the processes of top and middle managers. Our
   methodology involves survey data gathered twice from 328 TMT members and
   645 middle managers in 63 private companies in China. We find CEO
   humility to be positively associated with empowering leadership
   behaviors, which in turn correlates with TMT integration. TMT
   integration then positively relates to middle managers' perception of
   having an empowering organizational climate, which is then associated
   with their work engagement, affective commitment, and job performance.
   Findings confirm our hypotheses based on social information processing
   theory: humble CEOs connect to top and middle managers through
   collective perceptions of empowerment at both levels. Qualitative data
   from interviews with 51 CEOs provide additional insight into the meaning
   of humility among CEOs and differences between those with high and low
   humility.},

Abstract = {Most research in evidence-based entrepreneurship builds on quantitative

   unique contribution to the domain of entrepreneurship. They look at
   distinctive phenomena in their specific time period and context in one

   therefore, suggest using a systematic synthesis of case studies to
   aggregate the findings of qualitative research. Moreover, as a first
   step, we developed an example to demonstrate how this approach can
   advance evidence-based entrepreneurship. Specifically, we synthesized 13
   cases to examine how business clusters increase the performance of firms

Abstract = {Despite the common usage of the term, researchers and practitioners have
   not been able properly to explain what team spirit is and what benefits
   and drawbacks it might bring to teams. Several definitions have been
   proposed, but not in a consistent manner. Using a qualitative approach,
   we worked with one football team to shed light on how individuals
   experience and characterize team spirit. Our results suggest that team
   spirit is built around four paradoxes: these are a paradox of selfless
   egoism; a paradox of results; a paradox of conflict, and a paradox of
   relationships. Essentially, team spirit can be viewed as an
   inter-subjectively shared facility with which individual members of a
   team can balance opposing tensions in a consistent way, managing to
   maintain a healthy synthesis between individual and collective needs and
   expectations, preventing the team from dominating the individuals, as
   well as specific individuals from capturing the team.},

Abstract = {The long-term viability of virtual communities depends critically on
   contribution behavior by their members. We deepen and extend prior
   research by conceptualizing contributions to virtual communities in
   terms of small friendship group-referent intentional actions.
   Specifically, we investigate cognitive, emotional, and social
   determinants of shared we-intentions and their consequences for member
   contribution behavior to the small friendship group to which they belong
   within a larger community. Using multiple measurement sources and a
   longitudinal quasi-experimental design, we show that group norms and
   social identity, as well as attitudes and anticipated emotions,
   contribute to the development of behavioral desires, which in turn
   influence we-intentions. In addition, subjective norms are less
   effective than either group norms or social identity in encouraging
   contribution behavior. Finally, members' experience levels positively
   moderate the relationship between we-intentions and contribution
   behaviors, and differences between collectivistic versus individualistic
   orientations moderate the effects of social identity and anticipated
   emotions on the desire to contribute to one's friendship group in the
   virtual community. Tests for methods biases were conducted, as well as
   rival hypotheses. These findings have significant research and
   managerial implications.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF APPLIED PSYCHOLOGY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {99},
Number = {2},
Pages = {181-198},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {A growing number of studies have examined the ``sharedness{''} of
   leadership processes in teams (i.e., shared leadership, collective
   leadership, and distributed leadership). We meta-analytically cumulated
   42 independent samples of shared leadership and examined its
   relationship to team effectiveness. Our findings reveal an overall
   positive relationship (rho = .34). But perhaps more important, what is
   actually shared among members appears to matter with regard to team
   effectiveness. That is, shared traditional forms of leadership (e.g.,
   initiating structure and consideration) show a lower relationship (rho =
   .18) than either shared new-genre leadership (e.g., charismatic and
   transformational leadership; rho = .34) or cumulative, overall shared
   leadership (rho = .35). In addition, shared leadership tends to be more
   strongly related to team attitudinal outcomes and behavioral processes
   and emergent team states, compared with team performance. Moreover, the
   effects of shared leadership are stronger when the work of team members
   is more complex. Our findings further suggest that the referent used in
   measuring shared leadership does not influence its relationship with
   team effectiveness and that compared with vertical leadership, shared
   leadership shows unique effects in relation to team performance. In
   total, our study not only cumulates extant research on shared leadership
   but also provides directions for future research to move forward in the
   study of plural forms of leadership.},

Volume = {40},
Number = {2, SI},
Pages = {483-508},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {This article offers pipelines as a new perspective on human capital
   heterogeneity between firms. Using resource-based theory logic, we
   define pipelines as repeated interorganizational hiring and a practice
   firms use to differentially acquire and accumulate human capital and
   mitigate human capital risks. Pipelines are a ubiquitous staffing
   practice with ambiguous implications for firm performance that to date
   have eluded scholarly examination. Thus we use a systems framework to
   highlight input, output, and process contingencies in which pipeline
   hiring can create advantage over rivals-contingencies of human capital
   scarcity in the labor market, the choice of firm activity system, and
   product market ambiguity (i.e., credence qualities), respectively.
   Collectively, the article's theoretical foundations provide new insights
   for human resource, strategy, and human capital fields and open the
   conceptual space of pipelines for examination by organizational
   scholars. We discuss the theoretical, empirical, and practical
   implications accordingly.},

Abstract = {This paper examines the circumstances under which collective and private
   corporate political actions are more likely to be substitutes or
   complements. Using data based on a series of nationwide surveys
   conducted on privately owned firms in China, I find that firms that are
   engaged in collective political actions are more likely to pursue
   private political actions. This positive relationship is stronger in
   less economically developed provinces and when there are greater
   opportunities for the state to redistribute economic resources in
   product and capital markets. Meanwhile, this relationship is weaker in
   the presence of heavier regulatory burdens and for firms in which the
   state has some equity or owned by individuals who had prior political
   careers. These findings contribute to the corporate political action
   literature. Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Abstract = {This paper introduces a radically different conceptualization of human
   capital resources that runs counter to the individual-level approaches
   that have dominated human capital theory for the last 50 years. We
   leverage insights from economics, strategy, human resources, and
   psychology to develop an integrated and holistic framework that defines
   the structure, function, levels, and combinations of human capital
   resources. This multidisciplinary framework redefines human capital
   resources as individual or unit-level capacities based on individual
   knowledge, skills, abilities, and other characteristics (KSAOs) that are
   accessible for unit-relevant purposes. The framework and definition
   offer three broad contributions. First, multidisciplinary communication
   is facilitated by providing precise definitions and distinctions between
   individual differences, KSAOs, human capital, human capital resources,
   and strategic human capital resources. Second, given that human capital
   resources originate in individuals' KSAOs, multiple distinct types of
   human capital resources exist at individual and collective levels, and
   these types are much more diverse than the historical generic-specific
   distinction. Third, the multiple types of human capital resources may be
   combined within and across levels, via processes of emergence and
   complementarity. Consequently, the locus of competitive advantage has
   less to do with whether human capital resources are generic or specific
   but instead occurs because nearly all human capital resource
   combinations are complex, are firm-specific, and lack strategic (or
   efficient) factor markets. Overall, the proposed multidisciplinary
   framework opens new avenues for future research that challenge the
   prevailing literature's treatment of human capital resources.},

Title = {Changing the Memory of Suffering: An Organizational Aesthetics of the
   Dark Side},
Journal = {ORGANIZATION STUDIES},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {35},
Number = {2, SI},
Pages = {279-302},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {This paper addresses processes of subjection and abjection as expressed
   in organizational and collective memory. It complements recent
   developments in organizational memory studies by demonstrating how the
   dark side of organization has been subjected to what Susan Sontag calls
   a `collective instruction' process that normalizes how this dark side is
   understood, or marginalized. The paper argues that history today is
   often represented as kitsch and offers a method of aesthetic
   `juxtaposition' of visual artefacts that together with a detailed
   reading enables researchers to critically challenge this organization of
   memory and reintegrate abjected material. The method is exemplified by
   juxtaposing the iconic World War II photo of a little Jewish boy leaving
   his home with his hands in the air during the Nazi clearances of the
   Warsaw Ghetto and Paul Klee's iconic painting of an angel in terror,
   Angelus Novus, painted in 1920 just after World War I. The analysis
   demonstrates how history tends to be organized by a majoritarian system
   - in this case what has been termed `the Holocaust industry' - through
   collective instruction in how to interpret events, and outlines
   alternative ways for exposing and resisting this process, resulting in
   the creation of counter-narratives. This analytical strategy confirms
   that organizational aesthetics resides at the heart of what is
   political.},

Abstract = {Instrumental stakeholder theory proposes a positive relationship between
   fairness toward stakeholders and firm performance. Yet, some firms are
   successful with an arms-length approach to stakeholder management, based
   on bargaining power rather than fairness. We address this puzzle by
   relaxing the assumption that all stakeholders care about fairness.
   Empirical evidence from behavioral economics and social psychology
   suggests that firms face a population of potential stakeholders that
   consists not only of so-called reciprocators,' who do care about
   fairness, but also of self-regarding stakeholders, who do not. We
   propose that a fairness approach is more effective in attracting,
   retaining, and motivating reciprocal stakeholders to create value, while
   an arms-length approach is more effective in motivating self-regarding
   stakeholders and in attracting and retaining self-regarding stakeholders
   with high bargaining power. Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

   product and advertising preferences},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CONSUMER PSYCHOLOGY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {24},
Number = {1},
Pages = {87-95},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {This research examines the colors white and black and highlights the
   importance of automatic preference for the color white over black in
   product choice and advertising contexts. Across three studies, we
   incorporate multiple Implicit Association Tests to assess automatic
   preferences for colors, products, races, and advertisements. In Study 1,
   we demonstrate an automatic color preference for white over black, show
   that this preference holds for Caucasian-Americans and
   African-Americans, and find that automatic color preference predicts
   automatic product preference of white over black-colored products. Study
   2 extends these findings by showing that actual behavioral product
   choice is best predicted by a combination of automatic and explicit
   color preferences. In the advertising domain, Study 3 demonstrates how
   automatic color preference influences advertising responses and how it
   explains the lack of in-group preference by African-Americans in
   previous implicit studies of racial preference. Collectively, our
   research draws attention to the need to disentangle white and black as
   designation of colors versus racial groups, and offers significant and
   novel contributions to the work on color and race in consumer
   psychology. (C) 2013 Society for Consumer Psychology. Published by

Abstract = {Extant work shows that market actors who span multiple social categories
   tend to be devalued relative to their more specialized peers. Scholars
   typically explain this pattern of results with one of two arguments.
   Some contend that perceptual factors-namely, the difficulties that
   buyers have in making sense of category spanners-contribute to the
   observed pattern of devaluation. Others argue that the penalty for
   category-spanning stems from the fact that those who do not focus their
   efforts narrowly tend to offer products that are of lower quality.
   Because these two mechanisms often co-occur, it has been difficult to
   provide definitive evidence of the perceptually driven component of the
   multiple-category penalty. We employ a natural experiment on a
   peer-to-peer crowd-funding website to address this gap.
   Difference-indifference analyses on matched samples show that category
   spanning is perceived negatively and can result in devaluation, even in
   the absence of underlying quality differences. This result supports the
   argument that perceptual issues contribute to the penalty for category
   spanning.},

Abstract = {When most of the world's financial services giants were stumbling and
   retrenching in the aftermath of the 2008 recession, the asset management
   firm BlackRock was busy charting a course for growth. Its revenues,
   profits, and stock price all performed consistently through this
   tumultuous period. The authors looked at BlackRock and other
   game-changing companies-the Mumbai-based global conglomerate Tata Group,
   and Envision, an entrepreneurial alternative energy company based in
   China-and found significant commonalities. These three companies
   demonstrate the essential attributes of a game-changing organization:
   They are driven by purpose, oriented toward performance, and guided by
   principles.
   In the process of conducting interviews with these companies, the
   authors discovered a fourth thread that weaves them even more tightly
   together: Each is supported by a game-changing talent strategy. But,
   they write, the path to such a strategy seems rife with complexity and
   ambiguity. How can both strategy and execution be consistently superior?
   How can they support a collective culture yet enable high potentials to
   thrive as individuals? How can the strategy be global and local at the
   same time? And how can its policies endure yet be agile and constantly
   open to revitalization? BlackRock's approach provides the answers.},

Abstract = {Status is a valued workplace resource that facilitates career success,
   yet little is known regarding whether and how cultural orientation
   affects status attainment. We integrate status characteristics theory
   with the literature on individualism and collectivism and propose a
   cultural patterning in the determinants of status. Four studies (N =
   379) demonstrate that cultural orientation influences the tendency to
   view high status individuals as competent versus warm (Study 1), uncover
   cultural differences in both individuals' tendency to engage in
   competence and warmth behaviors to attain workplace status (Study 2) and
   evaluators' tendency to ascribe status to individuals who demonstrate
   competence versus warmth (Study 3), and verify that cultural differences
   in the effects of competence and warmth on status perceptions, and in
   turn performance evaluations, generalize to real world interdependent
   groups (Study 4). Our findings advance theory on the cultural
   contingencies of status attainment and have implications for managing
   diversity at work. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Paternalistic leaders provide care, nurturance, and guidance to
   employees in their professional and personal lives in a parental manner,

   study aims at investigating how the paternalistic leadership (PL)
   prototype converges and diverges with prototypes of transformational,
   authoritarian, participative, and nurturant-task leadership (NTL) in six
   countries representing high power distance and collectivism (China,
   Turkey, and Pakistan) and low power distance and individualism (the
   United States, Germany, and the Netherlands). A total of 1272 employees
   from six countries participated in this study. Findings revealed that
   the PL prototype converged more strongly with authoritarian leadership
   and NTL in hierarchical and collectivistic cultures than in egalitarian
   and individualistic ones. The relationship of the PL prototype with that
   of transformational and participative leadership was similar across
   cultures. Theoretical and managerial implications of these findings for
   international business are discussed.},

Abstract = {Under what conditions does a collective strategy exist among

   one way to start solving these puzzles I propose a view of
   organizational strategy as a language game that governs the use of
   strategy labels at the level of the organization. Organizational
   strategy exhibits a division of linguistic labour, where responsibility
   for key concepts is assigned to particular individuals or organizational
   functions. Such linguistic experts oversee the proper use and
   maintenance of strategy language. The language-based view helps to
   understand linkages between institutional, network, organizational, and
   micro level views on strategy. It also problematizes widely held
   intuitions regarding the relationship between strategy and
   organizational outcomes.},

Journal = {INFORMATION SYSTEMS RESEARCH},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {24},
Number = {4},
Pages = {1050-1067},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Virtual communities continue to play a greater role in social,
   political, and economic interactions. However, how users value
   information from these communities and how that affects their behavior
   and future expectations is not fully understood. Stock message boards
   provide an excellent setting to analyze these issues given the large
   user base and market uncertainty. Using data from 502 investor responses
   from a field experiment on one of the largest message board operators in
   South Korea, our analyses revealed that investors exhibit confirmation
   bias, whereby they preferentially treat messages that support their
   prior beliefs. This behavior is more pronounced for investors with
   higher perceived knowledge about the market and higher strength of
   belief (i.e., sentiment) toward a particular stock. We also find a
   negative interaction effect between the perceived knowledge and the
   strength of prior belief on confirmation bias. Those exhibiting
   confirmation bias are also more overconfident; as a result, they trade
   more actively and expect higher market returns than is warranted.
   Collectively, these results suggest that participation in virtual
   communities may not necessarily lead to superior financial returns.},

Abstract = {Protecting information from a variety of security threats is a daunting
   organizational activity. Organization managers must recognize the roles
   that organization insiders have in protecting information resources
   rather than solely relying upon technology to provide this protection.
   Unfortunately, compared to negative insider behaviors, the extant
   literature provides sparse coverage of beneficial insider activities.
   The few beneficial activities in the literature represent only a small
   portion of the diverse collection of insiders' protective actions.
   This research focuses on protection-motivated behaviors (PMBs), which
   are volitional behaviors enacted by organization insiders to protect (1)
   organizationally relevant information and (2) the computer-based
   information systems in which the information is stored, collected,
   disseminated, and/or manipulated from information security threats.
   Based on systematics, we propose a six-step methodology of qualitative
   and quantitative approaches to develop a taxonomy and theory of
   diversity for PMBs. These approaches integrate the classification
   techniques of multidimensional scaling (MDS), property fitting (ProFit),
   and cluster analyses. We leverage these techniques to identify and
   display how insiders collectively classify 67 unique PMBs and their
   homogeneous classes. Our taxonomy provides researchers and practitioners
   a comprehensive guide and common nomenclature for PMBs. Our methodology
   can be similarly used to create other theories of diversity.},

Abstract = {This research introduces a framework for selecting efficient interunit
   structures in facilitating the transfer of knowledge with different
   levels of complexity. We argue that while the boundary spanner structure
   is efficient for transferring discrete knowledge, it is inadequate for
   transferring collectively held complex knowledge. We propose that the
   transfer of such knowledge requires a more decentralized interunit
   structurecollective bridge, which is a set of direct interunit ties
   connecting the members of the source and the recipient units, with the
   configuration of the interunit ties matching the complexity of knowledge
   to be transferred. We suggest that while a collective bridge is
   inefficient in transferring discrete knowledge relative to a boundary
   spanner structure, it is more efficient for transferring collective
   knowledge. Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Abstract = {In recent years, marketing research and practice have recognized the
   importance of managing frontline employees' identification. However,
   investigations so far have focused on identification at the collective
   level of the self, such as organizational identification, thereby
   largely neglecting important interpersonal identification processes at
   the relational level. Using a large-scale dataset comprising information
   from sales managers and salespeople as well as company data on customer
   satisfaction and sales performance, the authors make a first attempt to
   address this neglect by exploring important phenomena of interpersonal
   identification in the sales manager-salesperson dyad. Results show that
   initial increases in the level of identification congruence between
   sales managers and their respective salespeople yield positive
   incremental effects on sales performance and customer satisfaction.
   Findings also show that interpersonal over-identification and
   identification incongruence are negatively related to both outcomes.
   Results demonstrate how sales managers could mitigate these negative
   effects.},

Abstract = {Goal setting in family firms is very complex due to the interplay
   between family and business systems. However, this topic is largely
   overlooked in family business research. In this qualitative study of
   goals and goal formulation processes among 76 organizational members
   across 19 family firms, we identify goal diversity as a direct
   consequence of the overlap between the family, ownership, and business
   systems. We found that goal diversity is expressed more strongly in the
   proximity of generational transitions, triggering social interaction
   processes through which organizational members contrast their goals. Our
   findings suggest that different types of social interactions lead to
   different behaviors, with familial social interactions being more
   effective than professional social interactions in managing goal
   diversity toward the formation of collective commitment to
   family-centered goals.},

Abstract = {Kotlar and De Massis found that membership assortment and the number of

   influence goal diversity in family firms. They also showed that goal
   diversity can be managed and family-centered goals can be stabilized
   through professional and familial social interactions, driving the
   formation of collective commitment to family-centered goals (CCFG).
   Using this research as a point of departure, we propose that CCFG may
   impact family firm economic and noneconomic performance. Furthermore, we
   introduce to the family firm literature the organizational psychological
   capital (OPC), consisting of hope, efficacy, resilience, and optimism.
   We also suggest that OPC may be more prevalent in family firms than in
   nonfamily firms. Moreover, OPC of family firms may play an important
   role in the link between CCFG and economic as well as noneconomic
   performance.},

Journal = {ORGANIZATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {24},
Number = {6},
Pages = {1601-1617},
Month = {NOV-DEC},
Abstract = {In structural analyses of innovation, one substantive question looms
   large: What makes radical innovation possible if peripheral actors are
   more likely to originate radical ideas but are poorly positioned to
   promote them? An inductive study of the rise of Cubism, a revolutionary
   paradigm that overthrew classic principles of representation in art,
   results in a model where not only the periphery moves toward the core
   through collective action, as typically asserted, but the core also
   moves toward the periphery, becoming more receptive to radical ideas.
   The fragmentation of the art market in early 20th-century Paris served
   as the trigger. The proliferation of market niches and growing ambiguity
   over evaluation standards dramatically reduced the costs of
   experimentation in the periphery and the ability of the core to suppress
   radical ideas. A multilevel analysis linking individual creativity, peer
   networks, and the art field reveals how market developments fostered
   Spanish Cubist Pablo Picasso's experiments and facilitated their
   diffusion in the absence of public support, a coherent movement, and
   even his active involvement. If past research attests to the importance
   of framing innovations and mobilizing resources in their support, this
   study brings attention to shifts in the structure of opportunities to do
   so.},

Abstract = {This paper focuses on the aesthetics of the uncanny to inquire into and
   perform affective sites of organizing that are imbued with feelings of
   uncertainty and uneasiness. We argue that the uncanny forms an
   unconcept' that allows us to think and apprehend white spaces' of
   organization not as new or other spaces but through a process of
   relating intensively with the conventional places, streets and squares
   that form the backdrop to everyday life. We also make use of the notion
   of unsiting' to show how organizational research is able to enhance our
   appreciation of the aesthetic dimension of organization in ways that
   expose and undermine that which has become familiar and
   taken-for-granted. Based on an artistic intervention by the theatre
   collective Rimini Protokoll, we encounter and analyse such processes of
   unsiting through the affective and spatial doublings at work in the
   organization of urban space. Theorizing the organizational uncanny opens
   up new sites/sights in organization by forging an interconnection of the
   recent affective, spatial and aesthetic turns' in organizational theory.
   To do this demands what we call scholarly performances that involve the
   witnessing and enacting of everyday sites of organizing.},

   Finally, we exploit regional variation in prison releases based on the

Abstract = {Using multimethod data on wedding consumption, this research highlights
   the pursuit of harmonization as a dynamic and never-ending process that
   can happen within individuals, between human beings, and among different

   construct as a core value of Chinese culture or a set of abstract
   principles that guide consumer behavior, the focus here is on how
   harmonization happens, the conditions under which harmonization is
   either promoted or defeated, and the benefits resulting from
   harmonization that keep people involved in the process of creating it.
   This examination of Vietnamese weddings demystifies the myth that Asian
   consumers sacrifice individual preferences and bow to collective
   interests, explains how face influences Asian consumer behavior, and
   provides an extension of Richins's categories or levels of consumption

Abstract = {While previous research has investigated structural hole positions
   through single-level models, describing their positive effects, this
   article elaborates a multilevel model and supports an antithetical
   position, revealing a dark side of structural holes. Although
   individual-level structural holes are supposed to exercise positive
   effects, it is theorized that group-level mean and group-level variance
   in structural hole positions are negatively associated with individual
   outcomes. The argument that justifies the aforementioned negative
   association is that the individualistic, competitive, manipulative and
   power-oriented behaviors of employees occupying structural hole
   positions may be beneficial when considering independent individuals,
   but, instead, they create frictions and problems when it comes to group
   functioning and group climate. This article provides evidence that group
   composition variables exercise a constraining effect on individuals,
   making them perceive less autonomy, and negatively affect satisfaction
   and performance. Findings provide support for the multilevel nature of
   networks and for the opposite causal mechanisms activated by structural
   holes at different levels of analysis.},

Abstract = {Drawing upon social cognitive theory, this research postulates cultural
   intelligence as a key driver of knowledge sharing among culturally
   diverse teams. An empirical testing of the proposed model, by
   investigating team leaders from high-tech industries, reveals the
   applicability of social cognitive theory in understanding cultural
   intelligence, perceived team efficacy, and knowledge sharing.
   Specifically, the test results herein show that knowledge sharing is
   directly influenced by metacognitive, cognitive, and motivational
   cultural intelligence. At the same time, knowledge sharing is indirectly
   impacted by metacognitive and behavioral cultural intelligence through
   the mediation of perceived team efficacy. Lastly, this research provides
   managerial implications and limitations. (c) 2013 Wiley Periodicals,

Abstract = {We advocate for more tolerance in the manner we collectively address
   categories and categorization in our research. Drawing on the prototype
   view, organizational scholars have provided a disciplining' framework to
   explain how category membership shapes, impacts, and limits
   organizational success. By stretching the existing straightjacket of
   scholarship on categories, we point to other useful conceptualizations
   of categories - i.e. the causal-model and the goal-based approaches of
   categorization - and propose that depending on situational
   circumstances, and beyond a disciplining exercise, categories involve a
   cognitive test of congruence and a goal satisfying calculus. Unsettling
   the current consensus about categorical imperatives and market
   discipline, we suggest also that audiences may tolerate more often than
   previously thought organizations that blend, span, and stretch
   categories. We derive implications for research about multi-category
   membership and mediation in markets, and suggest ways in which work on
   the theme of categories in the strategy, entrepreneurship, and
   managerial cognition literatures can be enriched.},

   to commercial databases compared with those that do not. We show that
   the largest divergences between the performance of reporting and
   nonreporting mega firms can be traced to differential exposure to credit
   markets. Thus, the performance of hard-to-observe mega firms can be
   inferred from observable data. This conclusion is robust to delisting

Journal = {ORGANIZATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {24},
Number = {5},
Pages = {1495-1516},
Month = {SEP-OCT},
Abstract = {The Internet has given rise to new organizational forms of integrating
   users into firm innovation. Companies willing to make use of external
   resources can now outsource innovation-related tasks to huge
   ``crowds{''} outside the company. The extant literature on participation
   motives assumes a symbiotic relationship between the firm and external
   contributors in which both parties have largely complementary motives
   and are only interested in their own utility. In two experimental
   simulations, we show that this understanding has to be amended:
   potential contributors not only want a good deal, they also want a fair
   deal. Fairness expectations with regard to the distribution of value
   between the firm and contributors (distributive fairness) and the
   fairness of the procedures leading to this distribution (procedural
   fairness) impact the likelihood of participation beyond considerations
   of self-interest. Fairness expectations are formed on the basis of the
   terms and conditions of the crowdsourcing system and the ex ante level
   of identification with the firm organizing it. In turn, they impact the
   individuals' transaction-specific reactions and also inform their future
   identification with the firm. These findings contribute not only to
   research on open and user innovation but also to theories on
   organizational fairness by enhancing our understanding of the emergent
   field of fairness expectations.},

Abstract = {Categorization processes have gained currency in organizational theory.
   Categories are endemic to organizations and markets, serving as

   prototype theory. Although we agree in spirit, we advocate an expansion
   of their perspective, which seems to focus primarily on the cognitive
   aspects of categorization and the force of their constraint,
   particularly at the individual level of analysis. We suggest three
   revisions to Durand and Paolella's arguments in order to extend the
   conversation. First, we advocate that categorization processes might
   usefully be understood by socio-cultural perspectives that explicitly
   consider the role of audiences and the embeddedness of categories in
   wider classification systems. Second, we connect categorization
   processes to identity formation and maintenance at the levels of both
   the organization and the market. Third, we move beyond the constraining
   power of categories to consider their generative capabilities in
   processes of emergence and change. Overall, we discuss these in the

Abstract = {Research on group creativity has concentrated on explaining how the

   evaluation of creative ideas as a process of convergent decision making
   that takes place after ideas are generated to improve the quality of the

   situated nature of evaluations that occur throughout the creative
   process. We present an inductive qualitative process analysis of four
   U.S. healthcare policy groups tasked with producing creative output in
   the form of policy recommendations to a federal agency. Results show
   four modes of group interaction, each with a distinct form of
   evaluation: brainstorming without evaluation, sequential interactions in
   which one idea was generated and evaluated, parallel interactions in
   which several ideas were generated and evaluated, and iterative
   interactions in which the group evaluated several ideas in reference to
   the group's goals. Two of the groups in our study followed an
   evaluation-centered sequence that began with evaluating a small set of
   ideas. Surprisingly, doing so did not impede the groups' creativity. To
   explain this, we develop an alternative conceptualization of evaluation
   as a generative process that shapes and guides collective creativity.},

Title = {THE GENERATIVE MECHANISMS OF DIGITAL INFRASTRUCTURE EVOLUTION},
Journal = {MIS QUARTERLY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {37},
Number = {3},
Pages = {907+},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The current literature on digital infrastructure offers powerful lenses
   for conceptualizing the increasingly interconnected information system
   collectives found in contemporary organizations. However, little
   attention has been paid to the generative mechanisms of digital
   infrastructure, that is, the causal powers that explain how and why such
   infrastructure evolves over time. This is unfortunate, since more
   knowledge about what drives digital infrastructures would be highly
   valuable for managers and IT professionals confronted by the complexity
   of managing them. To this end, this paper adopts a critical realist view
   for developing a configurational perspective of infrastructure
   evolution. Our theorizing draws on a multimethod research design
   comprising an in-depth case study and a case survey. The in-depth case
   study, conducted at a Scandinavian airline, distinguishes three key
   mechanisms of digital infrastructure evolution: adoption, innovation,
   and scaling. The case survey research of 41 cases of digital
   infrastructure then identifies and analyzes causal paths through which
   configurations of these mechanisms lead to successful evolution
   outcomes. The study reported in this paper contributes to the
   infrastructure literature in two ways. First, we identify three
   generative mechanisms of digital infrastructure and how they
   contingently lead to evolution outcomes. Second, we use these mechanisms
   as a basis for developing a configurational perspective that advances
   current knowledge about why some digital infrastructures evolve
   successfully while others do not. In addition, the paper demonstrates
   and discusses the efficacy of critical realism as a philosophical
   tradition for developing substantive contributions in the field of
   information systems.},

Abstract = {The aim of this study is to examine how learning emerges in terms of
   structure and function to transform from an individual to a collective
   (team) phenomenon. Drawing on learning theory and multilevel thinking,
   the authors developed and validated measures for the basic team learning
   processes (i.e., intuition, interpretation, integration, and
   codification) in three independent field studies of innovation project
   teams and employed multilevel structural equation modeling to test
   relationships across the individual and team levels of analysis. Their
   results confirm the hypothesis that team learning originates in
   individual intuitions, is amplified through interpretation and
   integration, and manifests itself at the team level via the codification
   of collective cognition and action. Across the three studies, team
   learning was found to significantly affect team performance. The
   authors' approach contributes to a conceptualization and measurement of
   team learning as a multilevel phenomenon.},

Abstract = {The goal of this study is to augment explanations of how newly
   implemented technologies enable network change within organizations with
   an understanding of when such change is likely to happen. Drawing on the
   emerging literature on technology affordances, the paper suggests that
   informal network change within interdependent organizational groups is
   unlikely to occur until users converge on a shared appropriation of the
   new technology's features such that the affordances the technology
   enables are jointly realized. In making the argument for the importance
   of shared affordances, this paper suggests that group-level network
   change has its most profound implications at the organization level when
   individuals use the same subset of a new information technology's
   features. To explore this tentative theory, we turn to a comparative,
   multimethod, longitudinal study of computer-based simulation technology
   use in automotive engineering. The findings of this explanatory case
   study show that engineers used the new technology for more than three
   months, during which time neither group experienced changes to their
   advice networks. Initially, divergent uses of the technology's features
   by engineers in both groups precluded them from being able to coordinate
   their work in ways that allowed them to structure their advice networks
   differently. Eventually, engineers in only one of the two groups
   converged on the use of a common set of the technology's features to
   enact a shared affordance. This convergence was necessary to turn the
   technology into a resource that could collectively afford group members
   the ability to compare their simulation outputs with one another and, in
   so doing, alter the content and structure of the group's advice network.
   The implications of these findings for the literatures on technology
   feature use, affordances, social networks, and post-adoption behaviors
   in organizations are discussed.},

Abstract = {Our research examines how knowledge professionals use mobile email
   devices to get their work done and the implications of such use for
   their autonomy to control the location, timing, and performance of work.
   We found that knowledge professionals using mobile email devices to
   manage their communication were enacting a norm of continual
   connectivity and accessibility that produced a number of contradictory
   outcomes. Although individual use of mobile email devices offered these
   professionals flexibility, peace of mind, and control over interactions
   in the short term, it also intensified collective expectations of their
   availability, escalating their engagement and thus reducing their
   ability to disconnect from work. Choosing to use their mobile email
   devices to work anywhere/anytime-actions they framed as evidence of
   their personal autonomy-the professionals were ending up using it
   everywhere/all the time, thus diminishing their autonomy in practice.
   This autonomy paradox reflected professionals' ongoing navigation of the
   tension between their interests in personal autonomy on the one hand and
   their professional commitment to colleagues and clients on the other. We
   further found that this dynamic has important unintended
   consequences-reaffirming and challenging workers' sense of themselves as
   autonomous and responsible professionals while also collectively
   shifting the norms of how work is and should be performed in the
   contemporary workplace.},

Abstract = {Ethnic and cultural diversity is an increasing reality in the US
   workplace. The current study highlights the importance of acknowledging
   the culturally heterogeneous nature of ethnic groups, and the need to
   focus on social identity characteristics such as cultural values when
   assessing group differences. We demonstrate that cultural values (i.e.,
   individualism) contribute to employees' experiences of work-family
   conflict beyond the effects of ethnicity. Specifically, we introduce a
   model informed by social identity theory that explains why acculturation
   is related to work-family conflict. The model was tested with a sample
   of 309 employed Caucasian and Hispanic Americans. An empirical test of
   our model provides evidence that individualism mediates the relationship
   between language- and social-based acculturation and work-family
   conflict, even when controlling for ethnicity. Additionally, alternative
   models further reveal that the effects of acculturation and
   individualism contribute to work interfering with family. As an
   implication of the current study, we suggest that researchers and
   organizational managers should consider the cultural values of their
   diverse workforce when implementing policies that affect conflict
   between work and family. (c) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

Abstract = {Universal access (UA) to the Internet and the associated information
   infrastructure has become an important economic and societal goal.
   However, UA initiatives tend to focus on issues such as physical access
   and geographical ubiquity, and they measure adoption through penetration
   rates. In this paper, we apply an interpretive case study approach to
   analyze the Philadelphia wireless initiative to provide insights into
   the nature of UA and extend this concept to also consider universal use
   (UU). UU is important because simply providing access does not guarantee
   use. UU is presented as a conceptual goal that starts with the challenge
   of physical access, but which necessarily also leads to considerations
   of use. The results show that the human and technological elements
   underlying individual access and use are deeply embedded within various
   institutional elements and collectives that enable but also constrain
   meaningful use. We integrate our findings into a multilevel framework
   that shows how access and use are influenced by both micro and macro
   factors. This framework provides new insights into the study of the
   information infrastructure, digital divide, and public policy.},

   micro-level perspective to study the subsequent intra-organizational
   processes through which these ideas are transformed into new workplace
   practices. We followed efforts to transform the organizationally
   accepted idea of interdisciplinary teamwork' into new everyday practices
   in four cases over a six year time period. We contribute to the
   literature by focusing on de-habitualizing and re-habitualizing
   behaviours that connect micro-level actions with organizational level
   theorizing. Our model illuminates three phases that we propose are
   essential to creating and sustaining this connection: micro-level
   theorizing, encouraging trying the new practices, and facilitating

Abstract = {We explore the relation between individualism and horizons and types of
   corporate investment, based on individualism's implications for risk
   taking. We find that firms in individualistic countries invest more in
   long-term (risky) than in short-term (safe) assets. Moreover, the effect
   of individualism on long-term investment hinges on R\&D: firms in
   individualistic countries invest more in R\&D projects but not more in
   physical assets. To test whether risk taking is the channel through
   which individualism works, we employ two-stage ordinary least squares
   and other analyses to nullify alternative explanations, such as: (1)
   uncontrolled institutions determine both individualism and R \& D; and
   (2) firms in individualistic countries invest more in R\&D because they
   have higher investment efficiency, or pick less-risky R\&D projects. We
   further find that individualistic firms tend to employ excess cash to
   increase R\&D rather than increase dividends, and R\&D decisions are
   less reliant on internal financing but more responsive to growth
   opportunities in individualistic countries.},

   defends the functional properties of self-efficacy by criticizing
   published studies that have demonstrated a negative relationship between
   self-efficacy and performance at the within-person level of analysis. We
   focus on the theoretical and methodological criticisms that Bandura has
   made in relation to our (Yeo \& Neal) 2006 piece that examined the
   dynamic relationship between self-efficacy and performance across levels
   of analysis and specificity. In doing so, we explain the importance of
   designing and analyzing studies involving self-efficacy at the
   within-person level of analysis. We then demonstrate how the concept of
   resource allocation can explain the co-existence of positive and
   negative dynamic self-efficacy effects across the between- and
   within-person levels of analysis. We acknowledge the great strides that
   researchers have made in understanding the complex and dynamic processes
   involving self-efficacy and encourage researchers to continue this
   collective effort.},

Abstract = {A variety of recent research by business, psychology, and sociology
   scholars offers a window into women's collective experiences at work.
   Some of these studies confirm widely held assumptions: that women are
   paid less than men; that the numbers of women drop dramatically the
   higher you go in organizations; that women are more ethical. But some
   cast doubt on other popular notions: that caring for their families is a
   major reason that high-achieving women leave their careers; that female
   MBAs are less likely to get job offers than male MBAs are; that being
   disliked is a disadvantage in the workplace. And some studies bring to
   light forms of discrimination that are less obvious but pernicious: the
   way men receive more plum assignments, more key sales accounts, and
   other marks of favor, while women get more praise but not necessarily
   the big promotions. One of the most disturbing studies? One that reveals
   the extent to which both women and men are biased against working
   mothers.},

Title = {The relation between equity incentives and misreporting: The role of
   risk-taking incentives},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF FINANCIAL ECONOMICS},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {109},
Number = {2},
Pages = {327-350},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Prior research argues that a manager whose wealth is more sensitive to
   changes in the firm's stock price has a greater incentive to misreport.
   However, if the manager is risk-averse and misreporting increases both
   equity values and equity risk, the sensitivity of the manager's wealth
   to changes in stock price (portfolio delta) will have two countervailing
   incentive effects: a positive ``reward effect{''} and a negative ``risk
   effect.{''} In contrast, the sensitivity of the manager's wealth to
   changes in risk (portfolio vega) will have an unambiguously positive
   incentive effect. We show that jointly considering the incentive effects
   of both portfolio delta and portfolio vega substantially alters
   inferences reported in prior literature. Using both regression and
   matching designs, and measuring misreporting using discretionary
   accruals, restatements, and enforcement actions, we find strong evidence
   of a positive relation between vega and misreporting and that the
   incentives provided by vega subsume those of delta. Collectively, our
   results suggest that equity portfolios provide managers with incentives
   to misreport when they make managers less averse to equity risk. (C)

Volume = {38},
Number = {6-7},
Pages = {484-504},

Abstract = {This paper examines the relationship between the institutional
   environment and sustained corporate illegality. We find that cognitive
   assumptions generate expectations that can, under specific
   circumstances, induce organizations to amplify illegal actions and that
   serve to lessen regulatory scrutiny. We also find that, once initiated,
   illegal actions can become hidden because of institutionalized practices
   that enable their concealment and that weaken the prospect of detection.
   These processes and effects are particularly noticeable in networks of
   professional regulators who become mutually over-confident and
   over-influenced by each other to the extent that their independent
   critical assessments and judgements are compromised. Mechanisms of
   mimetic herding and social humiliation compromise independence of
   judgement. Networks of interacting professionals are thus vulnerable to
   a collectively induced lowering of regulatory vigilance. (C) 2012

Abstract = {In this article, we explore some of the forms of institutional work that
   organizations perform as they participate externally in the processes
   that drive change in the institutional logic that characterizes their
   field, and as they respond internally to the shift as it occurs. More
   specifically, we present the results of an in-depth case study of Intel
   Corporation, a firm that was implicated in a fundamental shift in the
   institutional logic of its field in the late 1980s and 1990s as the
   field moved from a traditional supply chain logic dominated by computer
   assemblers to a new platform logic following very different organizing
   principles. Through the qualitative analysis of 72 interviews with Intel
   employees, complemented by extensive archival data from 1980 to 2000, we
   identify two forms of institutional work that Intel performed externally
   - external practice work and legitimacy work - and two forms of work
   that they carried out internally - internal practice work and identity
   work - as the organization worked to simultaneously influence the shift
   in logic that was occurring and to deal with the ramifications of the
   shift.},

Abstract = {Institutional theorists focus on practices that spread because they

   Frank Lloyd Wrighta building that challenged the accepted practices of
   ecclesiastical design in the architectural professionwith the most
   prominent churches during the same period. We find two distinct
   legitimation processesinstitutional evangelism where creators express
   their identity and generate novel practices versus adaptive emulation
   where adopters focus on prestigious others and emulate their established
   practices. We reveal that actors engaged in institutional evangelism and
   adaptive emulation, employing institutional work and leveraging ideas,
   materials and identities to effect, transform, and maintain
   institutions. Our comparative cases show the key role of materiality,

   facilitates organizing processes. As expected, this involves
   establishment of episodic closures, but also resistance to such.
   Further, the study shows important influence and organizing functions of

Abstract = {This study extends existing research about how peers and leaders
   influence newcomers' adjustment to an organization or profession by
   examining how specific trust perceptions evolve over time. We test a
   model of how affect-based trust in a leader and work unit peers develops
   from a basis of cognition-based trust and later influences
   organizational identification and role-related performance. U.S. Army
   soldiers were examined at the beginning, middle, and end of an
   intensive, 14-week residential entry program of training and collective
   socialization. Cross-lagged structural equation analyses supported a
   causal relationship of individuals' cognition-based trust with
   affect-based trust directed toward their unit peers and, separately,
   their leaders. Individuals with high levels of chronic relational
   identity exhibited a stronger time-lagged relationship between
   cognition-based trust and affect-based trust for trust in peers but not
   for trust in a leader. Affect-based trust in the leader had lagged
   influences on organizational identification and role-related performance
   at time 3. Affect-based trust in peers was related over time to
   organizational identification but not to role-related performance. We
   discuss the implications of these findings for understanding the
   separate influences of social exchange and social identity processes on
   newcomer adjustment, with distinct roles played by peers and leaders.},

Journal = {ORGANIZATION SCIENCE},

Number = {4},
Pages = {1014-1040},
Month = {JUL-AUG},
Abstract = {Despite increasing interest in transnational fields, transnational
   commons have received little attention. In contrast to economic models
   of commons, which argue that commons occur naturally and are prone to
   collective inaction and tragedy, we introduce a social constructionist
   account of commons. Specifically, we show that actor-level frame changes
   can eventually lead to the emergence of an overarching, hybrid ``commons
   logic{''} at the field level. These frame shifts enable actors with
   different logics to reach a working consensus and avoid ``tragedies of
   the commons.{''} Using a longitudinal analysis of key actors' logics and
   frames, we tracked the evolution of the global climate change field over
   40 years. We bracketed time periods demarcated by key field-configuring
   events, documented the different frame shifts in each time period, and
   identified five mechanisms (collective theorizing, issue linkage, active
   learning, legitimacy seeking, and catalytic amplification) that underpin
   how and why actors changed their frames at various points in
   time-enabling them to move toward greater consensus around a
   transnational commons logic. In conclusion, the emergence of a commons
   logic in a transnational field is a nonlinear process and involves
   satisfying three conditions: (1) key actors view their fates as being
   interconnected with respect to a problem issue, (2) these actors
   perceive their own behavior as contributing to the problem, and (3) they
   take collective action to address the problem. Our findings provide
   insights for multinational companies, nation-states, nongovernmental
   organizations, and other stakeholders in both conventional and
   unconventional commons.},

Title = {Relaxing the Taboo on Telling Our Own Stories: Upholding Professional
   Distance <i>and</i> Personal Involvement},
Journal = {ORGANIZATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {24},
Number = {4},
Pages = {1277-1290},
Month = {JUL-AUG},
Abstract = {Scholars studying organizations are typically discouraged from telling,
   in print, their own stories. The expression ``telling our own
   stories{''} is used as a proxy for field research projects that, in
   their written form, explicitly rely on a scholar's personal involvement
   in a field. (By personal involvement in a field, I mean a scholar's
   engagement in a set of mental activities that connect her to a field.)
   The assumption is that personal involvement is antithetical to
   maintaining professional distance. In this paper, I argue that the taboo
   against telling our own stories stems in part from an epistemological
   misunderstanding. Learning from the field entails upholding both
   distance and involvement; the two dimensions should not be
   conceptualized as opposite ends of a continuum. Moreover, I suggest that
   the taboo has become too extreme and stifles our collective capacity to
   generate new insights. To make this argument, I start by discussing the
   general taboo against telling one's own stories. Second, I focus on the
   rationale set forth to justify not only the taboo but also its
   limitations. Third, I examine what distance entails and how involvement,
   far from lessening distance, creates opportunities for generating
   potentially strong theoretical insight. Fourth, I showcase several areas
   of theoretical development that might benefit from revisiting the taboo.
   I conclude by reviewing key practical implications of such a shift for
   our profession and by arguing that organizational scholarship could gain
   a great deal from relaxing the taboo.},

Title = {A community psychology of object meanings: Identity negotiation during

Abstract = {What do material goods intended for personal consumption mean to
   community? We use the extreme example of natural disaster recovery in a
   community to explore this question. Our work describes how members make
   sense of material objects that transition from private to public
   possessions (damaged goods) and public to private possessions (donated
   goods). By blending consumer and community psychology perspectives with
   our narratives, we employ a three-dimensional framework for analyzing
   object meanings: (I) material objects as agents of communitas (a shared
   sense of ``we{''}), (2) material objects as agents of individualism (a
   focus on ``me{''}), and (3) material objects as agents of opposition
   (the ``we{''} that speaks for ``me{''} and ``us{''} versus ``them{''}).
   This theoretical frame allows us to show how different conceptions of
   identity lead to conflicting meanings of objects within community, and
   to explain how and why object meanings shift as objects move across time
   and space from private to public and from scarcity to abundance. We also
   provide implications for coping with disasters that consider collective
   and individual identities as well as oppositional stances in between.

Abstract = {Although research on team motivation has been one of the fastest growing
   research domains in organizational science, progress in this domain has
   been hampered by a lack of integrative reviews. Thus, we develop a
   theoretical framework in this article to summarize and discuss different
   conceptual approaches to team motivation for the following six content
   areas: team design, team needs, team goals, team self-regulation, team
   efficacy, and team affect. Our framework organizes previous research
   according to two dimensions. First, we assess the degree of
   interdependence between team members' motivational states,
   differentiating between models that conceptualize team motivation as
   functionally equivalent to individual level motivation and models that
   conceptualize team motivation as a truly collective phenomenon. Second,
   we assess the extent to which research conceptualizes team motivation as
   a dynamic phenomenon that evolves over time, with static models of team
   motivation and dynamic models of team motivation demarcating the
   opposite ends of this continuum. With this framework, we show that
   previous research on team motivation has overemphasized conceptual
   similarities between motivation constructs at the individual and team
   levels of analysis. We address this shortcoming by developing a theory
   of interdependent regulatory dynamics. This theory emphasizes the
   interdependent and dynamic nature of team motivation. It depicts the
   processes in which team members decide how to allocate their efforts and
   resources between individual goals and team goals, and it identifies the
   multiple pathways through which teams coordinate and regulate their
   collective efforts over time.},

Title = {Are Analysts' Cash Flow Forecasts Naive Extensions of Their Own Earnings
   Forecasts?},
Journal = {CONTEMPORARY ACCOUNTING RESEARCH},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {30},
Number = {2},
Pages = {438-465},
Month = {SUM},
Abstract = {We examine the sophistication of analysts' cash flow forecasts to better
   understand what accrual adjustments, if any, analysts make when
   forecasting cash flows. As a preliminary step, we first demonstrate that
   prior empirical tests used to evaluate the sophistication of analysts'
   cash flow forecasts are not diagnostic. We then present three sets of
   evidence to triangulate our conclusion that analysts' cash flow
   forecasts incorporate meaningful accrual adjustments. First, we review a
   stratified random sample of 90 analyst reports and find that the
   majority of these analysts include explicit adjustments for working
   capital and other accruals in their cash flow forecasts. Second, using a
   large sample of analysts' cash flow forecasts from 1993-2008, we find
   that these forecasts outperform time-series cash flow forecasts in
   correctly predicting the sign and magnitude of accruals. Finally, we
   find a significant market reaction to analysts' cash flow forecast
   revisions, suggesting that investors find these revisions informative.
   Collectively, our findings demonstrate that analysts' cash flow
   forecasts are not simply naive extensions of their own earnings
   forecasts, but that they reflect meaningful and useful accrual
   adjustments. These findings are relevant to researchers who examine
   analysts' cash flow forecasts in a variety of settings, and to investors
   and practitioners who employ these forecasts for valuation purposes.},

Title = {The Status Costs of Subordinate Cultural Capital: At-Home Fathers'
   Collective Pursuit of Cultural Legitimacy through Capitalizing
   Consumption Practices},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {40},
Number = {1},
Pages = {19-41},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Consumer researchers have primarily conceptualized cultural capital
   either as an endowed stock of resources that tend to reproduce
   socioeconomic hierarchies among consumer collectivities or as
   constellations of knowledge and skill that consumers acquire by making
   identity investments in a given consumption field. These studies,
   however, have given scant attention to the theoretical distinction
   between dominant and subordinate forms of cultural capital, with the
   latter affording comparatively lower conversion rates for economic,
   social, and symbolic capital. To redress this oversight, this article
   presents a multimethod investigation of middle-class men who are
   performing the emergent gender role of at-home fatherhood. Our analysis
   profiles and theoretically elaborates upon a set of capitalizing
   consumption practices through which at-home fathers seek to enhance the
   conversion rates of their acquisitions of domesticated (and subordinate)
   cultural capital and to build greater cultural legitimacy for their
   marginalized gender identity.},

Title = {The Effects of Diversity in Global, Distributed Collectives: A Study of
   Open Source Project Success},
Journal = {INFORMATION SYSTEMS RESEARCH},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {24},
Number = {2},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Diversity is a defining characteristic of global collectives facilitated
   by the Internet. Though substantial evidence suggests that diversity has
   profound implications for a variety of outcomes including performance,
   member engagement, and withdrawal behavior, the effects of diversity
   have been predominantly investigated in the context of organizational
   workgroups or virtual teams. We use a diversity lens to study the
   success of nontraditional virtual work groups exemplified by open source
   software (OSS) projects. Building on the diversity literature, we
   propose that three types of diversity (separation, variety, and
   disparity) influence two critical outcomes for OSS projects: community
   engagement and market success. We draw on the OSS literature to further
   suggest that the effects of diversity on market success are moderated by
   the application development stage. We instantiate the operational
   definitions of three forms of diversity to the unique context of open
   source projects. Using archival data from 357 projects hosted on
   SourceForge, we find that disparity diversity, reflecting variation in
   participants' contribution-based reputation, is positively associated
   with success. The impact of separation diversity, conceptualized as
   culture and measured as diversity in the spoken language and country of
   participants, has a negative impact on community engagement but an
   unexpected positive effect on market success. Variety diversity,
   reflected in dispersion in project participant roles, positively
   influences community engagement and market success. The impact of
   diversity on market success is conditional on the development stage of
   the project. We discuss how the study's findings advance the literature
   on antecedents of OSS success, expand our theoretical understanding of
   diversity, and present the practical implications of the results for
   managers of distributed collectives.},

Year = {2013},
Volume = {37},
Number = {2},
Pages = {511-536},

Abstract = {In this paper, we examine how the competitive industry environment
   shapes the way that digital strategic posture (defined as a focal firm's
   degree of engagement in a particular class of digital business practices
   relative to the industry norm) influences firms' realized digital
   business strategy. We focus on two forms of digital strategy: general IT
   investment and IT outsourcing investment. Drawing from prior literature
   on determinants of IT activity and competitive dynamics, we argue that
   three elements of the industry environment determine whether digital
   strategic posture has an increasingly convergent or divergent influence
   on digital business strategy. By divergent influence, we mean an
   influence that leads to spending substantially more or less on a
   particular strategic activity than industry norms. We predict that a
   digital strategic posture (difference from the industry mean) has an
   increasingly divergent effect on digital business strategy under higher
   industry turbulence, while having an increasingly convergent effect on
   digital business strategy under higher industry concentration and higher
   industry growth. The study uses archival data for 400 U.S.-based firms
   from 1999 to 2006. Our findings imply that digital business strategy is
   not solely a matter of optimizing firm operations internally or of
   responding to one or two focal competitors, but also arises strikingly
   from awareness and responsiveness to the digital business competitive
   environment. Collectively, the findings provide insights on how
   strategic posture and industry environment influence firms' digital
   business strategy.},

   ANALYSIS OF TWEETS DURING SOCIAL CRISES},
Journal = {MIS QUARTERLY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {37},
Number = {2},
Pages = {407-U120},

Abstract = {Recent extreme events show that Twitter, a micro-blogging service, is
   emerging as the dominant social reporting tool to spread information on
   social crises. It is elevating the online public community to the status
   of first responders who can collectively cope with social crises.
   However, at the same time, many warnings have been raised about the
   reliability of community intelligence obtained through social reporting
   by the amateur online community. Using rumor theory, this paper studies
   citizen-driven information processing through Twitter services using
   data from three social crises: the Mumbai terrorist attacks in 2008, the
   Toyota recall in 2010, and the Seattle cafe shooting incident in 2012.
   We approach social crises as communal efforts for community intelligence
   gathering and collective information processing to cope with and adapt
   to uncertain external situations. We explore two issues: (1) collective
   social reporting as an information processing mechanism to address
   crisis problems and gather community intelligence, and (2) the
   degeneration of social reporting into collective rumor mills. Our
   analysis reveals that information with no clear source provided was the
   most important, personal involvement next in importance, and anxiety the
   least yet still important rumor causing factor on Twitter under social
   crisis situations.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we report on an inductive study of how members of two
   nanotechnology research groups experience the issue of responsible
   innovation. We argue that the nascent process of institutionalizing
   responsible innovation requires studying the interplay between strategic
   and ethical agency. In order to better conceptualize links between
   strategic and ethical agency, and to make connections to professional
   practices and organizational capabilities, we draw on Maclntyre's virtue
   ethics. Our empirical evidence suggests that researchers and strategists
   in laboratories experience responsibility at two levels. Firstly, they
   recognize responsibility as unproblematic if it relates to contexts
   characterized by low uncertainty of relations between action and impact.
   We argue that this is explainable by high congruency between the all
   three types of agency and the existence of strong, stable and homogenous
   professional identity. Secondly, responsibility is perceived as
   problematic and ambiguous if relations between action and impact are
   characterized by high uncertainty. If issues of responsibility challenge
   established criteria of what constitutes scientific excellence and these
   are no longer in the autonomous domain of agents who actively
   participate in the practices of science, their very professional
   identity becomes contested, and congruency between different types of
   agency is interrupted. We argue that members of research laboratories
   seek to develop new organizational capabilities such as collaboration
   with new stakeholders of science-driven innovation and learning a new
   discourse that enables better communication between different
   constituencies. This deliberate engagement with the distributed and
   uncertain quest for responsible innovation requires both ethical and
   strategic judgment. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {This article reviews if the introduction of new laws to encourage and
   protect whistleblowers is sufficient to improve corporate governance in
   Malaysian public-listed companies. It provides suggestions to formulate
   internal whistle-blowing policies for companies. It concludes that due
   to the culture of the people and the taxonomy of Malaysian public-listed
   companies and companies in other countries in the Asia-Pacific region,
   having laws to encourage and protect whistleblowers to get rid of
   corporate wrong-doings is not necessarily the only solution. The article
   defines whistle blowing and the benefits of encouraging whistleblowers.
   It proceeds to highlight the issues of concern on whistle blowing. It
   also deliberates particular issues of whistleblowing in Malaysia by
   discussing the taxonomy of Malaysian public-listed companies, the
   strength of the regulators in enforcement, the Malaysian culture, and
   the Malaysian corporate scandals. The article elaborates on the
   whistle-blowing laws in Malaysia and concludes by providing alternate
   ways to encourage whistle blowing in Malaysian companies having in mind
   the taxonomy of Malaysian companies, enforcement by regulators and the
   Malaysian culture.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ETHICS},

Volume = {115},
Number = {1},
Pages = {17-31},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {How do Eastern and Western perceptions of ``tricky{''} or ethically
   ambiguous negotiation tactics differ? We address this question by
   comparing 161 Chinese and 146 Australian participants' ratings of the
   appropriateness of different types of negotiation tactics. We predict
   that their differing cultural values (e.g., individualism/collectivism,
   importance of face) as well as their different implicit theories of how
   negotiation ought to be conducted (i.e., mental models, such as captured
   in The Secret Art of War: The 36 Stratagems) will be salient in their
   perceptions of tactics. Examining 24 tactics falling into eight
   categories, we found that overall the Chinese respondents saw these
   tactics as more appropriate than did the Australian respondents. There
   were, however, differences across categories of tactics. Chinese
   participants rated tactics related to the 36 stratagems as significantly
   more appropriate than did Australian participants, including diverting
   attention, misrepresenting information and making false promises. In
   some cases, the Chinese also saw feigning positive feelings/emotions as
   more appropriate than did the Australian participants, while an
   Australian preference for feigning negative feelings/emotions was
   partially supported. The implications of these findings for
   practitioners are discussed, along with opportunities for future
   research.},

Abstract = {Digital divide initiatives in developing countries are an important

   We develop a model of technology use and economic outcomes of digital
   divide initiatives in developing countries. We use social networks as
   the guiding theoretical lens because it is well suited to this context,
   given the low literacy, high poverty, high collectivism, and an oral
   tradition of information dissemination in developing countries. We test
   our model with longitudinal data gathered from 210 families in a rural
   village in India in the context of a digital divide initiative. As
   theorized, we found that the social network constructs contributed
   significantly to the explanation of technology use (R-2 = 0.39). Also as
   we predicted, technology use partially mediated the effect of social
   network constructs on economic outcomes (R-2 = 0.47). We discuss
   implications for theory and practice.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEMS},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {30},
Number = {1},

Abstract = {The interdependency of information security risks often induces firms to
   invest inefficiently in information technology security management.
   Cyberinsurance has been proposed as a promising solution to help firms
   optimize security spending. However, cyberinsurance is ineffective in
   addressing the investment inefficiency caused by risk interdependency.
   In this paper, we examine two alternative risk management approaches:
   risk pooling arrangements (RPAs) and managed security services (MSSs).
   We show that firms can use an RPA as a complement to cyberinsurance to
   address the overinvestment issue caused by negative externalities of
   security investments; however, the adoption of an RPA is not
   incentive-compatible for firms when the security investments generate
   positive externalities. We then show that the MSS provider serving
   multiple firms can internalize the externalities of security investments
   and mitigate the security investment inefficiency. As a result of risk
   interdependency, collective outsourcing arises as an equilibrium only
   when the total number of firms is small.},

Abstract = {Although national culture is an important regulator of entrepreneurship,
   there is a dearth of studies that: (1) explore the effects of national
   cultural practices on entrepreneurial behaviors by individuals; (2) use

   culture on different entrepreneurial behaviors, such as entry and

   Monitor (GEM) and Global Leadership and Organizational Behavior
   Effectiveness (GLOBE) data from 42 countries for 2005-2008 to address
   these gaps, using a multilevel design. We found societal institutional
   collectivism practices negatively associated with entrepreneurial entry,
   but positively associated with entrepreneurial growth aspirations.
   Uncertainty avoidance practices were negatively associated with entry
   but not with growth aspirations, and performance orientation practices
   were positively associated with entry. Our analysis highlights the
   differential effects of cultural practices on entrepreneurial entry and
   growth aspirations, and demonstrates the value of multilevel techniques

Title = {Accounting as an affective technology: A study of circulation, agency
   and entrancement},

Abstract = {This paper argues that accounting is an affective technology. We show
   how people's feelings and emotions are constructed through accounting
   practices and templates. Much research in accounting and economics is
   based on rationality assumptions that suggest that people act after
   working through cost-benefit calculations. Information may be imperfect
   and our cognitive abilities constrained but such modes of calculation
   and economic reasoning are assumed to drive action. Whilst not setting
   aside the significance of rationality and intelligibility, this study
   illustrates that it is affect and passion alongside cognitive
   calculation that generate movement and action in organisational
   networks. An in-depth case study of a very large and well known global
   American corporation spanning 4 years illustrates how affect is
   engineered by corporate executives through accounting templates and
   targets. In local sites, periods of excitement and elation ensue but so
   do anxiety and sleepless nights as yet again, budgets are cut and stated
   targets rise. Productivity spreadsheets, planning pyramids and human
   resource programs all contribute to the circulation of affect in the
   global network as new identities (both individual and collective) are
   defined and underperforming employees managed out. The committed and
   devoted `Players' of the organisation express love for the firm,
   tolerate inconsistent instructions and overlook what might (by
   outsiders) be conceived as breaches of trust. As such, they collaborate
   in their own entrancement. We conclude that accounting technologies play
   on people's passions and emotions rather than purely on their
   intellectual and reasoning skills, and that it is this emotive edge to
   accounting that generates and sustains action in organisational
   networks. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

   Mediating Role of Collective Organizational Commitment and
   Organizational Citizenship Behavior},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {39},
Number = {4},

Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Despite the increasing significance of corporate ethics, few studies
   have explored the intermediate mechanisms that explain the relationship
   between corporate ethics and firm financial performance. Drawing on
   institutional theory and strategic human resource management literature,
   the authors hypothesize that the internal collective processes based on
   employees' collective organizational commitment and organizational
   citizenship behavior (OCB) mediate the ethics-performance relationship
   at the organizational level. The authors' hypotheses are tested using
   data collected from 3,821 employees from 130 Korean companies and the
   respective companies' financial performance data. The results indicate
   that collective organizational commitment and interpersonal OCB are
   meaningful intervening processes that connect corporate ethics to firm
   financial performance. To complement prior studies that identify a
   firm's reputation and external relations as mediators between corporate
   ethics and performance, the present study highlights the need to examine
   microprocesses occurring within the organization to account for the
   ethics-firm performance relationship. Moreover, the present
   demonstration of collective organizational commitment and OCB as
   meaningful predictors of a firm's objective performance indicates the
   significance of these employee processes in explaining
   organizational-level outcomes.},

Abstract = {Building on decades of research on the proactivity of individual

   performance in one of the largest sales organizations in the United

   senior managers establish more challenging goals for their business

   performance. We further found that employees' trust in the manager is a
   critical contingency variable that facilitates the relationship between
   challenging sales goals and subsequent sales performance. This research
   contributes to growing literatures on trust in leadership and
   proactivity by studying their joint effects at a district-unit level of

Abstract = {The corporation is a constitutive element of modern capitalism. In its
   contemporary form, the corporation comes with a striking legal feature:
   ownership is associated with limited liability. Today, we take for
   granted both the principle of limited liability and its association with
   the corporate form. Not so long ago, though, in the mid-19th century,
   the principle of limited liability was highly contentious, generating
   heated discussions and debates. This article explores the social
   movement dynamics that crystallized around the principle of limited
   liability in 19th-century England - intense framing strategies and
   politics of signification, collective articulation of resources and
   mobilization tactics as well as opportunistic use of dynamic
   opportunities. Interestingly, social movement dynamics did not imply in
   this case the structuration of a unitary social movement but involved
   instead a stunning coalition of the unlikely'. Two strikingly different
   groups championed limited liability on distinct grounds -
   enfranchisement of men' against enfranchisement of capital'. In the end,
   the latter framing imposed itself and debates found a resolution in the
   formal institutionalization of limited liability as a constitutive legal
   feature of incorporation. Altogether, these social movement dynamics
   proved highly consequential - marking a turning point in the history of
   capitalism, with profound implications for our contemporary
   understanding of responsibility in economic life.},

Abstract = {Within the United States, teams outperform solos in negotiation
   (Thompson, Peterson, \& Brodt, 1996). The current research examined
   whether this team advantage generalizes to negotiators from a
   collectivist culture (Taiwan). Because different cultures have different
   social norms, and because the team context may amplify the norms that
   are salient in a particular culture (Gelfand \& Realo, 1999), we
   predicted that the effect of teams on negotiation would differ across
   cultures. Specifically, we predicted that since harmony norms
   predominate in collectivist cultures like Taiwan, the team context would
   amplify a concern with harmony, leading Taiwanese teams to negotiate
   especially suboptimal outcomes. In support, 2 studies showed that
   Taiwanese teams negotiated less-optimal outcomes than Taiwanese solos.
   We also used a moderated-mediation analysis to investigate the mechanism
   (Hayes, 2012), documenting that the interactive effect of culture and
   context on outcomes was mediated by harmony norms. By showing that the
   same situational conditions (team negotiations) can have divergent
   effects on negotiation outcomes across cultures, our results point
   toward a nuanced, sociocontextual view that moves beyond the
   culture-as-main-effect approach to studying culture and negotiations.},

Volume = {98},

Abstract = {Given growing interest in collective turnover (i.e., employee turnover
   at unit and organizational levels), the authors propose an organizing
   framework for its antecedents and consequences and test it using
   meta-analysis. Based on analysis of 694 effect sizes drawn from 82
   studies, results generally support expected relationships across the 6
   categories of collective turnover antecedents, with somewhat stronger
   and more consistent results for 2 categories: human resource management
   inducements/investments and job embeddedness signals. Turnover was
   negatively related to numerous performance outcomes, more strongly so
   for proximal rather than distal outcomes. Several theoretically grounded
   moderators help to explain average effect-size heterogeneity for both
   antecedents and consequences of turnover. Relationships generally did
   not vary according to turnover type (e.g., total or voluntary), although
   the relative absence of collective-level involuntary turnover studies is
   noted and remains an important avenue for future research.},

Abstract = {We explored whether voluntary survey completion by team members (in

   team-emergent states. In doing so, we reanalyze less-than-complete
   survey data on 110 teams from a published field study, using so-called
   traditional and modern missing data techniques to probe the sensitivity
   of these team-level relationships to data missingness. The multivariate
   findings revealed that a greater within-team participation rate was
   indeed related to a higher team-level (mean) score on team mental
   efficacy (across all four missing-data techniques) and less dispersion
   among team member judgments about internal cohesion (when the 2 modern
   methods were used). In addition, results show that a commonly used
   approach of retaining only those teams with high participation rates
   produces inflated standardized effect size (i.e., R-2) estimates and
   decreased statistical power. Suggestions include research design
   considerations and a comprehensive methodology to account for team
   member data missingness.},

Title = {No News Is Bad News: Sensegiving Activities, Media Attention, and
   Venture Capital Funding of New Technology Organizations},
Journal = {ORGANIZATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {24},
Number = {3},
Pages = {865-888},
Month = {MAY-JUN},
Abstract = {A significant body of research has examined how new organizations gain
   legitimacy and how gaining it affects their subsequent access to
   resources. Less attention has been given to the problem of how new
   organizations attract collective attention. Although related to
   legitimation, the problem of attracting attention is distinct, as
   attention and evaluation are distinct cognitive processes. In this
   study, we examine the allocation of collective attention to new
   organizations in a system of relationships, within which new
   organizations seek to attract attention through their sensegiving
   activities; the information properties of their sensegiving activities
   affect the level of attention they receive from different types of
   media; and media attention, in turn, increases their perceived value
   potential in the eyes of venture capital investors (VCs). We examine
   these relationships in a sample of 398 information-technology start-ups
   that have obtained different levels of venture capital funding. Our
   results show that new organizations that engage in more intense and
   diverse sensegiving activities attract higher levels of industry media
   attention and that these effects are enhanced by the human capital of
   their founders and leaders. Diverse sensegiving activities are also
   associated with higher levels of attention from the general media, but
   only the attention of specialized industry media is positively

   new organizations affects how they are valued by a well-informed expert

Abstract = {Addressing the spread of cooperatives in the early 20th-century US
   economy, this study analyzes the role of anti-corporate movements in the
   diffusion of politically contested organizational innovations. It finds
   that institutional change can rest fundamentally on the combination of
   standard diffusion processes and collective mobilization in support of
   new practices. Specifically, it finds that the Grange, a leading
   anti-corporate social movement, was a political condition for the
   diffusion of cooperative alternatives to corporations in American
   capitalism. Cooperatives evoked fierce opposition by corporate forces,
   suppressing the diffusion of cooperative forms. When the Grange was weak
   or absent, cooperative organization in states or sectors had weak or no
   effects on cooperative organization in other states or sectors. But when
   the Grange was present and increased in strength, it amplified and even
   made possible the diffusion of cooperatives across states and
   industries. These findings shed new light on the contentious
   transactions between movements, corporations, and non-governmental
   organizations, expanding existing work on the trajectories, tactics, and
   organizational effects of anti-corporate movements.},

Abstract = {Individual and collective ethical stances regarding ethical consumption
   and related outcomes are usually seen as both a form of concern about
   extant market offerings and as opportunities to develop new offerings.
   In this sense, demand and supply are traditionally portrayed as
   interacting dialectically on the basis of extant business models. In
   general, this perspective implicitly assumes the juxtaposition of demand
   side ethical stances and supply side corporate initiatives. The Eataly
   story describes, however, a different approach to market transformation;
   in this case a company and a social movement (Slow Food) have negotiated
   and collaborated prior to initiating a new business model. This
   collaboration process and its outcomes are described, focusing
   specifically on ordinary Eataly customers' and Slow Food members'
   reactions. Given that Eataly can be regarded as a case of mainstreaming,
   ordinary customers seem satisfied with the new offering and the Slow
   Food support for the initiative; the more purist members of the Slow
   Food movement had critical concerns, however, as happened in similar
   conditions, according to literature, with regard to Fair Trade. The Slow
   Food endorsement of the new venture has also been observed from the
   attitude-behaviour gap perspective, as it contributed to addressing the
   factors affecting the gap between attitudes and actual behaviours.
   Extensive qualitative data were collected and analysed over a 3-year
   period. The main study implications refer to the ways in which companies
   and social movements could interact to co-design new business models, as
   well as outlining consumers' attitudes and behaviours towards such new
   offerings.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS STUDIES},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {44},
Number = {4},
Pages = {363-390},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {This paper examines how national culture, and collectivism in
   particular, influences corruption in bank lending. We hypothesize that
   interdependent self-construal and particularist norms in collectivist
   countries lead to a higher level of lending corruption through their
   influence both on the interactions between bank officers and bank
   customers and on the dynamics among bank colleagues. Using a sample
   covering 3835 firms across 38 countries, we find strong evidence that
   firms domiciled in collectivist countries perceive a higher level of
   lending corruption than firms domiciled in individualist countries. In
   terms of economic magnitude, the effect of collectivism is substantially
   larger than the effects of other cultural dimensions (uncertainty
   avoidance, masculinity, and power distance) and institutional factors
   identified in prior studies (bank supervision, bank competition,
   information sharing, and media monitoring). We further find that the
   positive relationship between collectivism and lending corruption is not
   driven by endogeneity, and that it is robust to different measures of
   bank corruption, different measures of collectivism, and different
   estimation methods. Finally, we find that the link between collectivism
   and lending corruption cannot be explained by the role of the government
   in the economy, political connections, biased responses from disgruntled
   borrowers, or relationship lending.},

   selective revealing as a strategic mechanism to reshape the

   We propose that selective revealing may provide an effective alternative
   to known collaboration mechanisms, particularly under conditions of high
   partner uncertainty, high coordination costs, and unwilling potential
   collaborators. We specify conditions when firms are more likely to
   reveal knowledge and highlight some boundary conditions for competitor
   reciprocity. We elaborate on strategies that allow firms to exhibit
   managerial agency in selective revealing and discuss selective
   revealing's implications for theories of organization and open

Abstract = {This article investigates collective denial and willful blindness in
   groups, organizations, and markets. Agents with anticipatory
   preferences, linked through an interaction structure, choose how to
   interpret and recall public signals about future prospects. Wishful
   thinking (denial of bad news) is shown to be contagious when it is
   harmful to others, and self-limiting when it is beneficial. Similarly,
   with Kreps-Porteus preferences, willful blindness (information
   avoidance) spreads when it increases the risks borne by others. This
   general mechanism can generate multiple social cognitions of reality,
   and in hierarchies it implies that realism and delusion will trickle
   down from the leaders. The welfare analysis differentiates group morale
   from groupthink and identifies a fundamental tension in organizations'
   attitudes towards dissent. Contagious exuberance can also seize asset
   markets, generating investment frenzies and crashes.},

Abstract = {We investigate the impact of political institutions on corporate
   risk-taking. Using a large sample of non-financial firms from 77
   countries covering the period from 1988 to 2008, we find that sound
   political institutions are positively associated with corporate
   risk-taking, and that this relation is stronger when government
   extraction is higher. In a subsample of 45 countries, we also find that
   politically connected firms engage in more risk-taking, which suggests
   that close ties to the government lead to less conservative investment
   choices. Our results are economically significant, and are robust to
   alternative risk-taking measures, various political institution proxies,
   cross-sectional and country-level regressions, and endogeneity concerns
   of political institutions. Our results have important implications for
   governments and corporate managers by providing direct relevance of
   political institutions to the corporate decision-making process. To
   encourage investment at the firm level, and hence innovation and overall
   growth, governments need to undertake the necessary reforms to control
   corruption and enforce contracts better, and thus decrease government
   predation and extraction. Journal of International Business Studies

Abstract = {Drawing on symbolic interactionism, we propose a process model for the

   perspective by exploring how routines, as collective accomplishments,
   are (re)created from within. In particular, we examine the mutual
   constitution of routines' constituent parts (performative and ostensive)
   through interaction, and we develop endogenous explanations of routine
   (re)creation grounded on the actions and understandings of mutually
   susceptible participants. Mead's concept of role taking, with its strong
   emphasis on the relational aspect of agency, enables us to account for
   the fitting together of individual lines of action (performative) and
   the sharing of participants' schemata (included in the ostensive) as
   mutually constituted processes that occur as participants develop
   distinct selves in the context of a routine. Moreover, we account for
   the content and structure of the ostensive aspect and propose a
   conceptualization that does justice to it as a singular structural
   construct and allows for its multiplicity.},

Abstract = {Traditionally, companies have managed their constituencies with specific
   processes: marketing to customers, procuring from vendors, developing HR
   policies for employees, and so on. The problem is, such processes focus
   on repeatability and compliance, so they can lead to stagnation.
   Inviting your constituencies to collectively help you solve problems and
   exploit opportunities-{''}co-creation{''}-is a better approach. It
   allows you to continually tap the skills and insights of huge numbers of
   stakeholders and develop new ways to produce value for all.
   The idea is to provide stakeholders with platforms (physical and digital
   forums) on which they can interact, get them to start exploring new
   experiences and connections, and let the system grow organically. A
   co-creation initiative by a unit of Becton, Dickinson and Company
   demonstrates how this works. A global leader in syringes, BD set out to
   deepen its ties with hospital customers and help them reduce the
   incidence of infections from unsafe injection and syringe disposal
   practices. The effort began with a cross-functional internal team,
   brought in the hospital procurement and supply managers BD had
   relationships with, and then reached out to hospitals'
   infection-prevention and occupational health leaders. Eventually product
   designers, nurses, sustainability staffers, and even hospital CFOs were
   using the platform, contributing data that generated new best practices
   and reduced infections. HBR Reprint R1304D},

Abstract = {This paper examines the characteristics and pricing of stocks that are
   actively traded by speculative retail investors. We find that stocks
   with high retail trading proportion (RTP) have strong lottery features
   and they attract retail investors with strong gambling propensity.
   Furthermore, these stocks tend to be overpriced and earn significantly
   negative alpha. The average monthly return differential between the
   extreme RTP quintiles is -0.60\%. This negative RTP premium is stronger
   among stocks that have lottery features or are located in regions where
   people exhibit stronger gambling propensity. Collectively, these results
   indicate that speculative retail trading affects stock prices.},

   research associated with creating common good in organizations:
   Spirituality, morality, positivity, and community, and links each of
   these elements to creating virtuous and compassionate organizations
   through narrative inquiry. The paper proposes that benevolent leadership
   can contribute to the long-term health and sustainability of
   organizations through its four elements: spiritual depth, ethical
   sensitivity, positive engagement, and community responsiveness.},

Volume = {42},
Number = {3},
Pages = {647-661},

Abstract = {Complex technologies are often developed in inter-organisational
   networks as actors try to reduce development costs and uncertainty about
   the viability of these innovations. However, as of to date it remains
   unclear how such innovations are financed collectively under conditions
   characterised by extreme uncertainty. Hence we explore how financial
   resources within innovation networks are mobilised and allocated. This
   question is of particular importance to the development of system
   technologies that are viable only if all critical components are
   functional on time. We explore this issue by reviewing the development
   of a radically new system technology for mass manufacturing microchips
   in the semiconductor industry. In this industry, technological roadmaps
   allow actors to identify critical components that still need to be
   developed. These components are the so-called roadmap gaps. However,
   suppliers can be reluctant to develop the required components at their
   own expense because of the high uncertainties involved. In such cases,
   providing financial support to component suppliers is a central task of
   innovation networks. The empirical analysis shows that semiconductor
   manufacturers take both an individual and a collective approach to
   filling roadmap gaps. This study contributes to prior research on
   innovation networks and financial management not only by identifying and
   clarifying these two approaches, but also by revealing under which
   conditions they are used. The findings are particularly relevant to
   scholars interested in the innovations of complex product systems
   (CoPS). (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

   in and more choice from mainstream markets? We develop answers to these
   questions drawing on institutional theory and a qualitative
   investigation of Fatshionistas, plus-sized consumers who want more

   mobilization are posited: development of a collective identity,
   identification of inspiring institutional entrepreneurs, and access to
   mobilizing institutional logics from adjacent fields. Several change
   strategies that reinforce institutional logics while unsettling specific
   institutionalized practices are identified. Our discussion highlights
   diverse market change dynamics that are likely when consumers are more
   versus less legitimate in the eyes of mainstream marketers and in
   instances where the changes consumers seek are more versus less
   consistent with prevailing institutions and logics.},

   when a movement's cultural and relational fabric becomes moderately

   permeable to external influence. We also elucidate how lead incumbents'
   attempts at movement cooptation may be deflected through distributed
   brokerage. The resulting confluence of cultural and relational
   ``structuration{''} between movement and field accelerates the pace but
   dilutes the radicalness of institutional innovation, ensuring ongoing,
   incremental field change. Overall, this article contributes to the
   emergent literature on field dynamics by uncovering the evolution and

Abstract = {Organizations must target talented applicants, who will often be
   demographically diverse, to attract the most competent and competitive
   workforce possible. Despite the bottom-line implications of attracting
   the best and brightest, surprisingly little is known about how and why
   diversity recruitment strategies affect recruitment outcomes (e.g.,
   job-pursuit intentions). To gain insight into this question, we
   conducted an initial experimental study (N = 194) to test the premise
   that other-group orientation moderates the relationship between
   perceived organizational value of diversity and job-pursuit intentions.
   In a follow-up experiment (N = 255), identity affirmation was examined
   as the mediating mechanism for the interaction observed in the first
   study. Mediated moderation analyses supported the proposed model.
   Collectively, the studies indicate that job seekers high in other-group
   orientation are more intent on pursuing employment with organizations
   deemed to value diversity because they feel that their salient
   identities are likely to be affirmed. No such indirect effect is present
   for those lower in other-group orientation.},

Abstract = {This paper illustrates how the payoff matrices of the single group
   Prisoner's Dilemma (PD) and the Inter-group Prisoner's Dilemma (IPD)
   differentially reinforce cooperation when participants care about
   relative performance. Examples of particular payoff patterns and thought
   experiments using a computational simulation demonstrate that
   withholding cooperation is not always the dominant strategy in the IPD.
   In the intergroup structure, three conditions differentially reinforce
   cooperation. When competing groups have equal numbers of cooperators,
   withholding cooperation is always the dominant strategy just as in the
   single group structure. In contrast, when one group has more cooperators
   than the other group, cooperation by its members can dominate
   withholding cooperation by members of the other group. Thus, the
   relative advantage of one group over another increases the payoff for
   cooperation in some configurations of the IPD over the payoff in the PD.
   Relative payoff is thus an untheorized variable motivating cooperation
   in the IPD. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {MNCs' politics has been considered a `contested terrain' and further
   research is needed into the dynamics between the Head Office's drastic
   restructuring decisions and local responses to understand how collective
   resistance is performed, and on what conditions. A neo-Gramscian
   approach is developed to analyse two plants in France facing drastic
   restructuring, including shutdown. We trace the dynamics of forces
   significant in aligning resisting subjects. We identify two structural
   processes - chains of equivalence and chains of difference - which were
   significant to the constitution of resistance. This article contributes
   to the development and refinement of a neo-Gramscian approach to
   management and organization studies in general and to multinational
   corporations' politics in particular. It refines the study of
   multinational corporations' politics by explaining how collective
   resistance is constituted and organized, what favours and limits the
   possibility of creating a collective antagonistic front and the role of

Abstract = {We draw on the early history of the management consulting field to build
   theory about how institutional entrepreneurs legitimate new kinds of
   organizations in emerging fields. We study the professional form of
   management consulting organization, which came to dominate other
   alternatives. Pioneers of this organizational form seized opportunities
   arising from broad institutional change to discredit the status quo and
   legitimate their model of how to advise organizations on strategic and
   operational issues. Similar to institutional entrepreneurs seeking to
   change mature fields, those in this emerging field engaged in
   theorization, undertook collective action, and established affiliations
   with recognized authorities and elites. But unlike institutional
   entrepreneurs in mature fields, the actors we studied could not leverage
   logics, positions, or collectivities within their emerging field;
   instead, they drew on logics from outside their field, sought
   affiliations with external authorities and elites, and emphasized the
   benefits of their activities for society at large. Our analysis thus
   suggests important differences in how actors legitimate novel
   organizational forms in emerging versus mature fields and underscores
   the need for theories of institutional entrepreneurship that explicitly
   account for field context.},

Title = {Does Information Asymmetry Matter to Equity Pricing? Evidence from

Journal = {CONTEMPORARY ACCOUNTING RESEARCH},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {30},
Number = {1},
Pages = {140-181},
Month = {SPR},
Abstract = {The scarcity of suitable proxies for asymmetric information has impeded
   empirical research from providing reliable evidence on whether
   information risk shapes equity pricing. In reexamining this unresolved
   question, we rely on firms' geographic distance from financial centers
   to gauge information asymmetry. We provide strong, robust evidence
   supporting the prediction that equity financing is cheaper for firms
   nearer central locations, implying that investors rationally require
   more compensation when information asymmetry is worse. The equity
   pricing role of geographic proximity is economically large, with our
   coefficient estimates translating into firms located within
   100kilometers of the city center of the nearest of six major financial
   centers, or in their metropolitan statistical areas, enjoying equity
   financing costs that are seven basis points lower. Our inferences are
   insensitive to measuring both the cost of equity capital and distance in
   several ways, controlling for corporate governance quality, and
   addressing endogeneity. Collectively, our analysis suggests that
   investors discount the price that they pay for their securities to
   reflect the greater information asymmetry that ensues when firms are far
   from major financial centers.},

Volume = {91},
Number = {3},
Pages = {110+},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Emerging economies are often thought of as environmental laggards;
   they're perceived to be focused more on addressing poverty than on
   protecting the planet. But when the Boston Consulting Group and the
   World Economic Forum went looking for the best sustainable business
   practices in the developing world, their researchers uncovered many
   visionary enterprises that defied that stereotype. These organizations
   show that in markets where resource depletion is most keenly felt,
   conservation efforts can be a wellspring of innovation-and a source of
   competitive advantage.
   Some of these enterprises pursue sustainability out of pragmatism; some
   out of idealism. But all have consistently generated above-average (and
   in some cases, astounding) growth rates and profit margins. They've
   achieved them by following one or more of three general approaches: (1)
   taking a long view and investing in initially more-expensive sustainable
   operating methods that eventually lead to dramatically tower costs and
   higher yields; (2) bootstrapping-making small adjustments that generate
   big savings, which then fund purchases of advanced technologies; and (3)
   extending their sustainability efforts to the operations of their
   customers and suppliers (and in the process, devising new business
   models).
   Collectively, these companies demonstrate that there need be no
   trade-off between sustainability and financial performance. Rather, the
   pursuit of sustainability can be a powerful path to reinvention for all.

   Performance},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT},

Volume = {39},
Number = {3},
Pages = {573-603},

Abstract = {Previous research has primarily revealed a negative relationship between
   collective employee turnover and organizational performance. However,
   this research also suggests underlying complexity in the relationship.
   To clarify the nature of this relationship, the authors conduct a
   meta-analytic review in which they test and provide support for a
   portion of Hausknecht and Trevor's model of collective turnover. The
   authors' meta-analysis includes 48 independent samples reporting 157
   effect size estimates (N = 24,943), tests six hypothesized moderator
   variables, and provides path analyses to test alternative
   conceptualizations of the turnover-organizational performance
   relationship. Results indicate that the mean corrected correlation
   between turnover and organizational performance is -.03, but this
   relationship is moderated by several important variables. For example,
   the relationship is stronger in manufacturing and transportation
   industries (-.07), for managerial employees (-.08), in midsize
   organizations (-.07), in samples from labor market economies (-.05), and
   when organizational performance is operationalized in terms of customer
   service (-.10) or quality and safety (-.12) metrics. In addition,
   proximal performance outcomes mediate relationships with financial
   performance. The authors discuss implications of their results for
   theory and practice and provide directions for future research.},

Abstract = {We hypothesize that the information on a CEO's and directors' (board

   showing that (1) managerial traits such as overconfidence,
   over-optimism, and the illusion of control affect corporate decisions
   and that (2) these same personal traits explain personal
   over-indebtedness and credit defaults. Our results of analyzing the
   credit data files of more than 100,000 CEOs and directors of the Finnish
   private limited liability companies support this hypothesis. Our results
   remain materially unchanged when using the bootstrapping method to

Abstract = {Three computer-controlled experiments were conducted to study
   interactions between individuals and non-cooperative groups in
   prototypical social-dilemma games. The asymmetric competition between an
   individual and a group was compared with symmetric control conditions
   where both competitors were either individuals or groups. All games were
   played repeatedly with the same players interacting for 120 rounds. The
   results show that the outcome of the conflict depends both on the type
   of competing players and on the structure of the competition. Generally,
   individuals do better than non-cooperative groups, regardless of the
   type of conflict, and more often than not it is better to have a
   non-cooperative group rather than an individual as an opponent. The
   relative advantage is a result of individuals generally cooperating
   better with other individuals (as compared to cooperation between two
   groups), and that in mixed competitions the individual takes advantage
   of the group's difficulties in mobilizing collective-action, and
   dominates it. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Companies have increasingly advocated social media technologies to

   scrutinizes the predictive relationships between social media and firm

   relationships. The results derived from vector autoregressive models
   suggest that social media-based metrics (Web blogs and consumer ratings)
   are significant leading indicators of firm equity value. Interestingly,
   conventional online behavioral metrics (Google searches and Web traffic)
   are found to have a significant yet substantially weaker predictive
   relationship with firm equity value than social media metrics. We also
   find that social media has a faster predictive value, i.e., shorter
   ``wear-in{''} time, than conventional online media. These findings are
   robust to a consistent set of volume-based measures (total blog posts,
   rating volume, total page views, and search intensity). Collectively,
   this study proffers new insights for senior executives with respect to
   firm equity valuations and the transformative power of social media.},

Abstract = {The authors propose a new structural solution to the knowledge-sharing
   dilemma. They show that simple auction mechanisms, which impose a rigid
   set of rules designed to standardize interactions and communication
   among participants, can prevent some of the detrimental effects
   associated with conflict of interest in freely interacting groups. The
   authors report results of two experiments that show that transparent
   conflicts of interest lead to a breakdown of information sharing,
   learning, and knowledge transfer in freely interacting groups, but not
   in simple markets and auctions. In these settings, participants were
   able to identify the best candidate in a voting game and to learn the
   solution to an intellective reasoning task, allowing participants to
   successfully transfer their insights to a series of new intellective
   tasks (tackled up to four weeks later), despite the conflicts of
   interests among traders. The authors explain their findings within the
   theoretical framework of collective induction. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Title = {Task Bubbles, Artifacts, Shared Emotion, and Mutual Focus of Attention:
   A Comparative Study Of the Microprocesses of Group Engagement},
Journal = {ORGANIZATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {24},
Number = {2},
Pages = {455-475},
Month = {MAR-APR},
Abstract = {Based on a comparative field study of two software development projects,
   we use ethnographic methods of observation and interview to examine the
   question of how interdependent individuals develop and maintain mutual
   focus of attention on a shared task, which we define as the group
   engagement process. Drawing on Randall Collins' interaction ritual
   theory, we identify how mutual focus of attention develops through the
   presence of a task bubble that focuses attention by creating barriers to
   outsiders and through the effective use of task-related artifacts.
   Shared emotion both results from mutual focus of attention and
   reinforces it. Through our comparison between the two projects, we show
   that the group engagement process is enabled by factors at the
   individual (individual engagement), interaction (frequency and
   informality of interactions), and project (compelling direction of the
   overall group) levels. Our focus on group interaction episodes as the
   engine of the group engagement process illuminates what individuals do
   when they are performing the focal work of the group (i.e., solving
   problems related to the task at hand) and how they develop and sustain
   the mutual focus of attention that is required for making collective
   progress on the task itself. We also show the relationship between the
   group engagement process and effective problem solving.},

Abstract = {The extant workplace bullying literature has largely overlooked the
   potential role of culture. Drawing on cognitive consistency theory,
   culture's influence on targets' reactions toward subtle forms of
   bullying during its early stages is theorized. This theoretical analysis
   proposes that employees high in individualism and low in power distance
   are more likely to engage in resistance-based responses toward subtle
   acts of bullying than employees high in collectivism and power distance,
   respectively. Targets' resistance-based responses, which are also
   influenced by learned helplessness deficits, along with perpetrator
   revenge behaviors, influence whether bullying becomes prolonged. A
   number of testable propositions are offered based on the conceptual
   model presented. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed
   and avenues for future research are offered.},

   the world, and that these institutional effects involve both competition
   and cooperation between blockholders and collective labor interests. We
   also find that relational blockholders are better able to cope with, or
   benefit from, these institutional effects than arm's-length
   blockholders. Empirically, we use advanced meta-analytic methods on a
   total sample of 748,569 firm-year observations, derived from 162 studies

Title = {The psychology of social dilemmas: A review},
Journal = {ORGANIZATIONAL BEHAVIOR AND HUMAN DECISION PROCESSES},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {120},
Number = {2, SI},
Pages = {125-141},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Broadly defined, social dilemmas involve a conflict between immediate
   self-interest and longer-term collective interests. These are
   challenging situations because acting in one's immediate self-interest
   is tempting to everyone involved, even though everybody benefits from
   acting in the longer-term collective interest. As such, greater
   knowledge of social dilemmas should help us understand not only the
   theoretical puzzles of why people cooperate (or not) but also the ways
   in which cooperation in groups and organizations can be maintained or
   promoted. This article reviews different types of social dilemmas,
   highlights recent developments in the field (especially within
   psychology), and suggests some new avenues for future research. We
   illustrate that the field of social dilemma is growing and flourishing
   in terms of theory, interdisciplinary collaboration, and applicability,
   producing insights that are novel, replicable, and applicable to many
   social situations where short-term self-interest is at odds with the
   long-term interests of teams, organizations, or nations. (C) 2012

   Behaviors?},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MARKETING},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {77},
Number = {2},
Pages = {78-95},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The authors explore how injunctive appeals (i.e., highlighting what
   others think one should do), descriptive appeals (i.e., highlighting
   what others are doing), and benefit appeals (i.e., highlighting the
   benefits of the action) can encourage consumers to engage in relatively
   unfamiliar sustainable behaviors such as ``grasscycling{''} and
   composting. Across one field study and three laboratory studies, the
   authors demonstrate that the effectiveness of the appeal type depends on
   whether the individual or collective level of the self is activated.
   When the collective level of self is activated, injunctive and
   descriptive normative appeals are most effective, whereas benefit
   appeals are less effective in encouraging sustainable behaviors. When
   the individual level of self is activated, self-benefit and descriptive
   appeals are particularly effective. The positive effects of descriptive
   appeals for the individual self are related to the informational
   benefits that such appeals can provide. The authors propose a
   goal-compatibility mechanism for these results and find that a match of
   congruent goals leads to the most positive consumer responses. They
   conclude with a discussion of implications for consumers, marketers, and
   public policy makers.},

   the unfamiliar familiar but conceptually distinct. We also find that
   each process relates to analogical transfer, but in a more pluralistic

Abstract = {The share of household resources devoted to children is hard to identify
   because consumption is measured at the household level and goods can be
   shared. Using semiparametric restrictions on individual preferences
   within a collective model, we identify how total household resources are
   divided up among household members by observing how each family member's
   expenditures on a single private good like clothing vary with income and
   family size. Using data from Malawi we show how resources devoted to
   wives and children vary by family size and structure, and we find that
   standard poverty indices understate the incidence of child poverty. (JEL

Abstract = {We build theory on the process of collective identity resurrection
   through a qualitative study investigating how community members
   reenergized a valued community identity following years of decline. Our
   findings suggest a recursive model of identity resurrection, in which
   community leaders marshal tangible resources such as money and human
   talent to orchestrate experiences and community members authenticate the
   experiences by judging them resonant with memories and existing identity
   symbols. This model draws attention to the role of experience and
   emotion in identity processes, extending theory that has tended to focus
   narrowly on cognitive aspects of collective identity. We discuss
   implications for processes of identity reproduction and resurrection in
   organizational settings, and for interdependencies between community and
   organizational identities.},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {This article presents a reframing of workforce diversity as a social
   tragedy. We draw on Hardin's concept of `tragedy of the commons', which
   explored the conflicts between individual and collective good. We
   identify two dilemmas that underscore the social tragedy of diversity
   and explain why they prevent workforce diversity from progressing: (1)
   voluntarism and (2) individualism. We critique the simplistic models of
   managing diversity and suggest an alternative conceptualization as a way
   forward. We advocate an approach that captures the potential
   contradictions between individual and social good and accounts for the
   role of multiple actors in tackling the tragedy of the uncommons. A
   reframing of organizational self-interest and collective interests in
   the context of diversity is presented and solutions to social tragedy of
   diversity are proposed.},

Abstract = {Using a 199-day ethnography of Cambridge's 2007 season preparations for
   the annual University Boat Race, we explore the microprocesses through
   which highly institutionalized practices are maintained by examining how
   institutional inhabitants collectively restore breakdowns in
   institutionalized practice. Our analysis reveals how institutions can be
   inoculated against such breakdowns through maintenance work. We find
   that the salience and importance of different forms of maintenance work
   vary with the nature and process history of practice breakdowns. This
   lends institutions the plasticity through which ever-changing practice
   performances can be accommodated without necessarily effecting permanent
   structural change.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this article is to present and discuss the values and
   limits of microfinance within the context of poverty reduction,
   international development, and community empowerment. The main thesis is
   that microfinance requires a more complex strategy than simply the
   provision of credits. The development of financial capital depends on
   the increase in human capacity and social capital. Microfinance is
   revisited under the ethical lenses of global responsibility for
   alleviating poverty and developing community sustainability. Through a
   critical review of the literature and case studies from the Philippines,
   the author suggests a value-based Vincentian approach to integrate
   microfinance into community empowerment. In connection with the main
   thesis the author argues that the achievement of economic self-reliance
   through microfinance is contingent upon the development of capacity
   building, social capital, and empowerment at the individual, collective,
   and systemic levels.},

   Investigation},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ETHICS},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {112},
Number = {3},
Pages = {437-451},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {This research consists of two studies with interrelated objectives. The
   purpose of the first study is to develop and validate scales measuring
   whistle-blowing subjective norms, attitudes, and intentions. The
   objective of the second study is to test a model of whistle-blowing
   intentions, motivated by the theory of reasoned action, across two
   contrasting cultures: the collectivist Thai and the individualistic
   American. To achieve cross-cultural comparisons, we first perform
   measurement and structural invariance tests. Tests of latent mean
   differences lend support for our prediction that individuals in the
   collectivist Thai culture have higher means on subjective norms,
   attitudes, and intentions for whistle-blowing than members of the
   individualist American culture. Our models indicate that subjective
   norms for whistle-blowing, even though significantly different for
   American and Thai participants, have a direct effect on whistle-blowing
   attitudes as well as direct and indirect effects on reporting intentions
   for both subject groups. Compared to American subjects, the
   whistle-blowing intentions of Thai participants are more strongly
   influenced by subjective norms for whistle-blowing.},

   MANAGEMENT STUDIES},
Journal = {ACADEMY OF MANAGEMENT REVIEW},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {38},
Number = {1},
Pages = {6-31},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Management scholars have long separated the study of work and diversity,
   assuming that the nature of work itself is not affected by race or
   gender. Research on occupational segregation invalidates this
   assumption, confirming that we judge the nature of work in large part by
   the social identities aligned with it. Management theorists have yet to
   digest this evidence because of a unilateral view of the
   work-practitioner relation (i.e., people derive identity from work),
   which conceals a reciprocal relation (i.e., work derives identity from
   associated people). I build a bilateral view that accommodates available
   evidence by theorizing a new glass metaphor-the glass slipper-to capture
   occupational identity by association as it yields systematic forms of
   advantage and disadvantage. The metaphor elucidates how occupations come
   to appear ``naturally{''} possessed of features that fit certain people
   yet are improbable for others. This article thus contributes to
   management knowledge by redefining the current division of scholarly
   labor as a consequential theoretical problem and developing the
   requisite theoretical tools to redress that problem. Through the glass
   slipper metaphor. I theorize collective occupational identity and its
   relation to other social identities in a way that fosters the
   sustainable integration of work and diversity studies.},

Title = {Mistaking an Emerging Market for a Social Movement? A Comment on
   Arjalies' Social-Movement Perspective on Socially Responsible Investment
   in France},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ETHICS},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {112},
Number = {2},
Pages = {205-212},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {In a recent contribution to this journal, ArjaliSs (J Bus Ethics
   92:57-78, 2010) suggests that the emergence of socially responsible
   investment (SRI) in France can be best described as a social movement
   with a collective identity that aimed to challenge the dominant logic of
   the financial market. Such an account is at odds with a body of
   empirical studies that approaches SRI in the French context as a process
   of market creation led by loosely coordinated actors with contradictory
   and conflicting interests and values, who have mainly complied
   with-rather than opposed-the existing dominant financial logic of the
   asset-management field. In this comment, we build on this prior research
   to contest ArjaliSs' perspective on both theoretical and empirical
   grounds, with the aim of highlighting the shortcomings of conflating
   social movements and other forms of collective actions in understanding
   the building of new markets in organization theory and SRI studies. We
   contend that in mistaking for social movement forms of collective
   actions that underpin the emergence of markets, scholars of organization
   theory may confuse distinct mechanisms in their explanation of SRI
   emergence across countries, overlook the complex dynamics and
   interactions of markets and social movements, and, most importantly,
   fail to evaluate the real political significance of SRI as an empirical
   phenomenon. We propose that future research on SRI distinguishes
   carefully ``social-movement research as a theoretical framework{''} from
   ``social movement as an empirical phenomenon{''} in order to avoid such
   drawbacks while benefiting from recent advances in social-movement
   research.},

Journal = {HUMAN RELATIONS},

Abstract = {Ageing workforces are placing conflicting pressures on European trade
   unions in order to, on the one hand, protect pensions and early
   retirement routes, and, on the other, promote human resource management
   (HRM) policies geared towards enabling their older members to extend
   working life. Using interviews from German and United Kingdom (UK) trade
   unions, we discuss how unions are both constrained and enabled by
   pre-existing institutional structures in advocating approaches to age
   management. In Germany, some unions use their strong institutional role
   to affect public policy and industrial change at national and sectoral
   levels. UK unions have taken a more defensive approach, focused on
   protecting pension rights. The contrasting varieties of capitalism,
   welfare systems and trade unions' own orientations are creating
   different pressures and mechanisms to which unions need to respond.
   While the German inclusive system is providing unions with mechanisms
   for negotiating collectively at the national level, UK unions' activism
   remains localized.},

Title = {When Does Employee Turnover Matter? Dynamic Member Configurations,
   Productive Capacity, and Collective Performance},

Abstract = {In theory, employee turnover has important consequences for groups, work
   units, and organizations. However, past research has not revealed
   consistent empirical support for a relationship between aggregate levels
   of turnover and performance outcomes. In this paper, we present a novel
   conceptualization of turnover to explain when, why, and how it affects
   important outcomes. We suggest that greater attention to five
   characteristics-leaver proficiencies, time dispersion, positional
   distribution, remaining member proficiencies, and newcomer
   proficiencies-will reveal dynamic member configurations that predictably
   influence productive capacity and collective performance. We describe
   and illustrate the five properties, explain how particular member
   configurations exacerbate or diminish turnover's effects, and present a
   new measurement approach that captures these characteristics in a
   collective context and over time.},

Journal = {OPERATIONS RESEARCH},

Volume = {61},
Number = {1},
Pages = {214-227},
Month = {JAN-FEB},
Abstract = {We propose a class of functions, called multiple objective satisficing
   (MOS) criteria, for evaluating the level of compliance of a set of
   objectives in meeting their targets collectively under uncertainty. The
   MOS criteria include the joint targets' achievement probability (joint
   success probability criterion) as a special case and also extend to
   situations when the probability distributions are not fully
   characterized. We focus on a class of MOS criteria that favors
   diversification, which has the potential to mitigate severe shortfalls
   in scenarios when any objective fails to achieve its target. Naturally,
   this class excludes joint success probability. We further propose the
   shortfall-aware MOS criterion (S-MOS), which is inspired by the
   probability measure and is diversification favoring. We also show how to
   build tractable approximations of the S-MOS criterion. Because the S-MOS
   criterion maximization is not a convex optimization problem, we propose
   improvement algorithms via solving sequences of convex optimization
   problems. We report encouraging computational results on a blending
   problem in meeting specification targets even in the absence of full
   probability distribution description.},

Abstract = {We develop a theory of collective turnover that emphasizes its
   microfoundation origins and unit-level consequences. Collective turnover
   is the quantity and quality of depletion of employee knowledge, skills,
   abilities, and other characteristics (KSAOs) from the unit, meaning that
   it is the collective loss of unit KSAOs. We ground our theory of
   collective turnover within the nomological network of human capital
   resources and resource-based theory. We then use this framework to
   examine the dynamic relationships between collective turnover and human
   capital resources and their effects on unit performance. We also
   describe the moderating impact of context (climate and environmental
   complexity) and time. Thus, we present context-emergent turnover (CET)
   theory.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {39},
Number = {1},
Pages = {110-135},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The authors conducted a theoretical review of the change readiness
   literature and identified two major limitations with this work. First,
   while there is substantial agreement about the key cognitions that
   underlie change readiness, researchers have not examined the affective
   element of this attitude. Second, researchers have not adopted a
   multilevel perspective when considering change readiness. The authors
   address these limitations and argue that it is important to incorporate
   affect into definitions of the change readiness construct and also when
   measuring this construct. They then develop a multilevel framework that
   identifies the antecedents and consequences of individual, work group,
   and organizational change readiness. Next, the authors outline the
   theoretical processes that lead to the development of individual and
   collective change readiness. They then review theoretical and empirical
   evidence to identify the antecedents of change readiness at the three
   levels of analysis. Finally, the authors identify a number of
   suggestions to guide future research seeking to adopt a multilevel
   approach to change readiness.},

Abstract = {This article explores the moderating influence of Hofstede's cultural
   dimensions (individualism/collectivism, masculinity/femininity,

   The integration of justice theories with Hofstede's national culture
   typology implies multiple, and potentially competing, propositions
   regarding the impact of culture on justice effects. To sort out these
   issues, the authors present meta-analytic findings summarizing data from
   495 unique samples, representing over 190,000 employees working in 32
   distinct countries and regions. Results indicate that justice effects
   are strongest among nations associated with individualism, femininity,
   uncertainty avoidance, and low power distance. The authors discuss these
   findings in terms of the practice of justice across cultures.},

Abstract = {This paper examines how actors within a mature cultural field use their
   field positions to create opportunities for institutional
   entrepreneurship. Our analysis of the product innovation of a Knock-Out
   Cup in English County Cricket between the 1930s and 1960s shows that
   when the economic viability of a mature cultural field is threatened,
   actors learn to recursively create market and political opportunities
   for institutional entrepreneurship by deploying the resources of their
   field positions in tactics targeted at shifting product category
   boundaries. We find that `lone hero' institutional entrepreneurs who
   experience failure from working in relative isolation learn to acquire
   new resources and deploy them in new tactics leading to a more
   collective approach, which is necessary for disrupting the institutional
   gatekeeping work that maintains a mature cultural field. (C) 2011

Title = {Audit Market Concentration and Auditor Tolerance for Earnings Management},
Journal = {CONTEMPORARY ACCOUNTING RESEARCH},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {29},
Number = {4},
Pages = {1171+},
Month = {WIN},
Abstract = {In recent years, policymakers have expressed concern about the risks
   posed by audit market concentration (i.e., high market shares for the
   dominant Big 4 audit firms) for audit quality. In this paper, we examine
   the relation between concentration at the local (i.e., metropolitan
   statistical area) level and auditor tolerance for earnings management
   during 2003-2009. Specifically, we focus our analysis on clients that
   met (or beat) the analysts' earnings forecast but would have missed the
   target in the absence of positive (i.e., income-increasing)
   discretionary accruals. Using a sample of clients whose earnings before
   performance-adjusted discretionary accruals are below the consensus
   analysts' earnings forecast, we find higher concentration is associated
   with an increased likelihood of the client meeting or beating the
   earnings target. Our findings hold after accounting for the effects of
   concentration on audit fees, the potential endogeneity of concentration,
   and other variables identified in the prior literature to affect audit
   quality. A separate analysis of the earnings distributions for all
   companies covered by I/B/E/S during 2003-2009 also suggests that higher
   concentration increases clients' propensity to just beat (rather than
   just miss) the analysts' earnings forecast. Collectively, our findings
   are consistent with the misgivings expressed by policy makers, that is,
   that oligopolistic dominance of the audit market by the Big 4 fosters
   complacency among auditors resulting in a more lenient and less
   skeptical approach to audits and lowers service quality.},

   We present a theory-generating, interpretative field study of a highly

   argue that what has been labeled collective mindfulness is only possible
   through a dialectic process of collective minding, in which
   organizational actors simultaneously exhibit elements of being mindful
   and mindless. Our analysis reveals that collective minding emerges from
   struggling with contradictions in the five elements of mindfulness. We
   argue that when actors struggle with these dialectic tensions, the same
   information technology capabilities are enacted as multiple,
   contradictory technologies-in-practice. Implications for the further
   study of collective minding and the appropriation of IT capabilities are

Abstract = {This paper examines income shifting of U.S. multinational companies over
   the past two decades. Domestic and foreign policy makers are
   increasingly concerned with the effect of income shifting on dwindling
   tax revenues, however, extant research on income shifting by U.S.
   multinational enterprises is mixed. We address the disconnect between
   the academic literature and the policy maker's perceptions by examining
   the extent of multijurisdictional income shifting by U.S. multinational
   companies. We directly address conflicting results in extant literature
   and show that using either multiperiod proxies or instrumental variables
   overcomes weaknesses of annual proxies in this setting. Our tests show
   that U.S. companies have become more active at shifting income out of
   the United States as the regulatory costs of shifting have changed.
   Holding tax rate differences between U.S. and foreign jurisdictions
   constant, our empirical estimates suggest that our sample of 380
   corporations with low average foreign tax rates collectively shifts
   approximately \$10 billion of additional income out of the United States
   annually during 20052009 relative to 19982002 due to varying regulatory
   costs of shifting.},

Journal = {MIS QUARTERLY},

Abstract = {Globalization has triggered a rapid increase in cross-border mergers and
   acquisitions (M\&As). However, research shows that only 17 percent of
   cross-border M\&As create shareholder value. One of the main reasons for
   this poor track record is top management's lack of attention to
   nonfinancial aspects (e.g., sociocultural aspects) of M\&As. With the
   rapid growth of Web 2.0 applications, online environmental scanning
   provides top executives with unprecedented opportunities to tap into
   collective web intelligence to develop better insights about the
   sociocultural and political-economic factors that cross-border M\&As
   face. Grounded in Porter's five forces model, one major contribution of
   our research is the design of a novel due diligence scorecard model that
   leverages collective web intelligence to enhance M\&A decision making.
   Another important contribution of our work is the design and development
   of an adaptive business intelligence (BI) 2.0 system underpinned by an
   evolutionary learning approach, domain-specific sentiment analysis, and
   business relation mining to operationalize the aforementioned scorecard
   model for adaptive M\&A decision support. With Chinese companies'
   cross-border M\&As as the business context, our experimental results
   confirm that the proposed adaptive BI 2.0 system can significantly aid
   decision makers under different M\&A scenarios. The managerial
   implication of our findings is that firms can apply the proposed BI 2.0
   technology to enhance their strategic decision making, particularly when
   making cross-border investments in targeted markets for which private
   information may not be readily available.},

   address social problems, create new institutions, and dismantle outdated
   institutional arrangements. Specifically, we examine collective social
   entrepreneurship across a diverse range of collaborative activities
   including movements, alliances and markets for social good. We identify
   resource utilization approaches and three associated sets of activities
   that illustrate the work of collective social entrepreneurs-framing,
   convening, and multivocality. Using illustrative case studies to examine
   the phenomenon, we highlight the capacity of collective action across
   sectors to create markets, institutions and organizations and, to derive
   success by resonating through embeddedness in broader social movements.},

Title = {Free Spaces as Organizational Weapons of the Weak: Religious Festivals
   and Regimental Mutinies in the 1857 Bengal Native Army},
Journal = {ADMINISTRATIVE SCIENCE QUARTERLY},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {57},
Number = {4},
Pages = {625-668},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Free spaces are arenas insulated from the control of elites in
   organizations and societies. A basic question is whether they incubate
   challenges to authority. We suggest that free spaces foster collective
   empowerment when they assemble large numbers of people, arouse intense
   emotion, trigger collective identities, and enable individuals to engage
   in costly collective action. We analyze challenges to authority that
   invite repression: mutinies of regiments in the East India Company's
   Bengal Native Army in India in 1857. We take advantage of an exogenous
   source of variation in the availability of free spaces-religious
   festivals. We predict that mutinies are most likely to occur at or right
   after a religious festival and find that the hazard of mutiny declines
   with time since a festival. We expect community ties to offer alternate
   avenues of mobilization, such as when regiments were stationed close to
   the towns and villages from which they were recruited. Moreover,
   festivals are likely to be more potent instantiations of free spaces
   when regiments were exposed to an oppositional identity, such as a
   Christian mission. Yet even free spaces have a limited ability to
   trigger collective action, such as when the political opportunity
   structure is adverse and prospective participants are deterred by
   greater chances of failure. These predictions are supported by analyses
   of daily event-history data of mutinies in 1857, suggesting that free
   spaces are an organizational weapon of the weak and not a substitute for
   dissent.},

Year = {2012},
Volume = {90},
Number = {12},
Pages = {44+},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {When the history of an organization comes up, it's usually in connection
   with an anniversary just part of the ``balloons and fireworks{''} (as
   one business leader characterized his company's bicentennial
   celebration, knowing that the investment of time and money would have
   little staying power). A fast-changing world leaves little time for
   nostalgia and irrelevant details or, worse, strategies for winning the
   last war. But the authors, business historians at the Winthrop Group,
   assert that leaders with no patience for history are missing a vital
   truth: A sophisticated understanding of the past is one of the most
   powerful tools they have for shaping the future. The job of leaders,
   most would agree, is to inspire collective efforts and devise smart
   strategies for the future. History can be profitably employed on both
   fronts. As a leader strives to get people working together productively,
   communicating the history of the enterprise can instill a sense of
   identity and purpose and suggest the goals that will resonate. In its
   most familiar form, as a narrative about the past, history is a rich
   explanatory tool with which executives can make a case for change and
   motivate people to overcome challenges. Taken to a higher level, it also
   serves as a potent problem-solving tool, one that offers pragmatic
   insights, valid generalizations, and meaningful perspectives a way to
   cut through management fads and the noise of the moment to what really
   matters. HBR Reprint R1212B},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The current research examines the conditions under which consumers
   demonstrate associative versus dissociative responses to identity-linked
   products as a consequence of a social identity threat. Across four
   studies, the authors test the notion that reactions to social identity
   threat may be moderated by self-construal by examining subcultural
   differences in ethnic background, priming self-construal, and
   investigating cross-national differences in cultural background. Those
   with more independent self-construals tend to avoid identity-linked
   products when that identity is threatened versus not threatened. Those
   with more interdependent self-construals, in contrast, demonstrate more
   positive preferences for identity-linked products when that aspect of
   social identity is threatened. These effects arise because, while
   independents are motivated to restore positive self-worth when a social
   identity is threatened, interdependents access a repertoire of social
   identities to fulfill belongingness needs when threatened.},

Abstract = {We investigate the implications of collective and individual producer

   competition and allow free-riding on DfR efforts to reduce product
   recovery costs. Thus, manufacturer preferences for IPR or CPR may differ
   because of the free-riding implications under CPR, with even high-end
   manufacturers having incentives to free-ride under certain competitive
   conditions. The policy choice between IPR and CPR is not clear cut from
   an economic welfare perspective. This choice involves a comparison
   between the effects of superior recovery cost reduction through improved
   DfR under IPR and the operational cost-efficiency under CPR.},

Abstract = {We develop and extend fledgling literature on procedural justice climate
   and succession processes in family firms by focusing on the impact of
   family vision and exchange systems on procedural justice climate among
   nonfamily managers. Drawing upon social exchange theory, we argue that
   family involvement accompanied by a weak family vision will be
   associated with restricted exchanges in dominant coalitions, which will
   have a negative impact on procedural justice climate among nonfamily
   managers. Conversely, we suggest that family involvement with a strong
   family vision will be accompanied by generalized exchange, which should
   positively impact the procedural justice climate among nonfamily
   managers. We expect that the extent to which nonfamily managers work to
   support or hinder intra-family succession will be influenced by their
   collective perception of a positive or negative procedural justice
   climate.},

Volume = {111},
Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {121-132},

Abstract = {This article proposes the lens of moral economy as a useful ethical
   framework through which to assess HRM practice, with a particular focus
   on the strategic use of contingent work ('non-standard' employment
   practices including temporary, agency and outsourced work). While
   contingent work practices have a variety of impetuses we focus here on
   their strategic use in the pursuit of economic and flexibility goals. A
   review of the contingent work literature conveys mixed messages about
   its outcomes for individuals, and more opaquely, for organisations: on
   the one hand transferring risks yet on the other, creating
   opportunities. A moral economy lens views employment as a relationship
   rooted in a web of social dependencies, and considers that `thick'
   relations produce valuable ethical surpluses that represent mutuality
   and human flourishing. Applying such an approach to the analysis of
   contingent work enables a fresh interpretation of contradictory
   individual and collective outcomes observed in the research literature.
   We suggest that evaluations informed by moral economy offer a more
   holistic appraisal of HRM practices such as contingent work, where both
   economic and social opportunities and costs can be more fully seen. In
   this way we not only highlight the ethical inadequacies of neglecting
   the human in HRM but also the conceptual pitfalls of analytically
   separating the economic from the social.},

Abstract = {Recent literature on institutional entrepreneurship has examined the
   enabling conditions under which actors may influence institutional
   arrangements. Whereas conditions at field level and among actors have
   been highlighted, scholars have paid little attention to how and why the
   field is amenable to change at certain times and how actors act upon
   these conditions in a timely fashion. This paper examines the temporal
   conditions for institutional entrepreneurship. I propose that a
   collective of time-aware institutional entrepreneurs opens a window of
   opportunity for policy breakthrough by relating its activities to
   temporally favorable conditions of the multidimensional institutional
   process. These theoretical propositions are illustrated through an
   empirical case study of how aviation was targeted for its climate change

Journal = {QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {127},
Number = {4},
Pages = {1755-1812},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Despite their importance, there is limited evidence on how institutions
   can be strengthened. Evaluating the effects of specific reforms is
   complicated by the lack of exogenous variation in institutions, the
   difficulty of measuring institutional performance, and the temptation to
   ``cherry pick{''} estimates from among the large number of indicators
   required to capture this multifaceted subject. We evaluate one attempt
   to make local institutions more democratic and egalitarian by imposing
   participation requirements for marginalized groups (including women) and
   test for learning-by-doing effects. We exploit the random assignment of
   a governance program in Sierra Leone, develop innovative real-world
   outcome measures, and use a preanalysis plan (PAP) to bind our hands
   against data mining. The intervention studied is a ``community-driven
   development{''} program, which has become a popular strategy for foreign
   aid donors. We find positive short-run effects on local public goods and
   economic outcomes, but no evidence for sustained impacts on collective
   action, decision making, or the involvement of marginalized groups,
   suggesting that the intervention did not durably reshape local
   institutions. We discuss the practical trade-offs faced in implementing
   a PAP and show how in its absence we could have generated two divergent,
   equally erroneous interpretations of program impacts on institutions.

   will result in greater retaliation. We then test the effect of a
   supervisor recovery attempt, hypothesizing that a recovery will
   negatively impact retaliation and that the coreness of the violated
   member moderates this effect, such that it is more important to recover
   a core member. We test our hypotheses utilizing 64 teams engaged in a
   command-and-control simulation. Results generally support our hypotheses
   for retaliation in the form of fewer supervisor-directed organizational
   citizenship behaviors but are less supportive for retaliation in the

Abstract = {Confidence is necessary for effective top management team (TMT)
   functioning, however overconfidence or hubris has been associated with
   poor outcomes. Researchers have struggled to untangle questions of how

   confidence. Using data from a field study of 54 public high-technology
   firms we provide a richer understanding of the complex influence of one
   type of confidence, TMT potency on strategic decision-making.
   Specifically, using a field study of TMTs of 54 public high technology
   firms we find potency at least partially mediates the relationship
   between TMT experience and knowledge, TMT interaction process, and
   strategic decision speed. Post-hoc analysis of high potency teams
   suggests that potency may be either functional leading to high
   performance, or dysfunctional resulting in low performance. Potency
   appears to be a multi-faceted construct consisting of both level and
   domain boundedness. We offer propositions that begin to untangle the
   origins of functional versus dysfunctional potency or hubris.},

Abstract = {Technology standards refer to the specifications that provide users and
   vendors with a common platform and ensure compatibility between
   components of a technological system. These technical ``rules of the
   game{''} are being increasingly set in standards development
   organizations (SDOs). In this paper, I ask the question: how do actors
   operating in these venues address the challenges posed by the
   anticipatory and collective nature of the specifications they are
   establishing? Through an in-depth analytic narrative of the Ethernet LAN
   (local area network) standard, I indicate how actors engage in an
   ongoing process of extension generation, ratification and incorporation.
   In imagining alterations to a specification, approving timely
   modifications and crafting an identity for a rule even as it changes,
   they manifest ``pragmatic agency{''} in these contexts. In exercising
   such agency, SDO's substantially increase the functionality of an
   existing standard as well as boost its long-term competitive viability.

   3-week period. We also examined the relative importance of these
   leadership behaviors for predicting perceived leader effectiveness as
   rated by subordinates and peers. Results indicated that leaders'
   collective and individual identities were uniquely related to
   transformational and abusive behaviors, respectively. We also observed a
   significant collective by individual identity interaction, such that
   abusive behaviors were most frequent when a strong individual identity
   was paired with a weak collective identity. Frequency of
   transformational behaviors accounted for the largest proportion of
   variance in perceived leader effectiveness, followed by frequency of
   abusive behaviors and consistency of transformational behaviors. We
   discuss the implications of these findings for leadership theory and

   Leadership and Organizational Behavior Effectiveness (GLOBE) cultural
   value dimensions on the relationship between employees' perceptions of
   their organization's social responsibility and their affective
   organizational commitment. Based on data from a sample of 1,084
   employees from 17 countries, results showed that perceived corporate
   social responsibility (CSR) was positively related to employees'
   affective commitment (AC), after controlling for individual job
   satisfaction and gender as well as for nation-level differences in
   unemployment rates. In addition, several GLOBE value dimensions
   moderated the effects of CSR on AC. In particular, perceptions of CSR
   were more positively related to AC in cultures higher in humane
   orientation, institutional collectivism, ingroup collectivism, and
   future orientation and in cultures lower in power distance. Implications
   for future CSR research and cross-cultural human resources management
   are discussed.},

Abstract = {The present study offers competing hypotheses regarding the

   with changes in work-to-family and family-to-work conflict. Data were
   collected from 250 U.S. and 165 Chinese managers and professionals, all
   of whom were married, at 3 points in time over a 10-month period.
   Results suggest that increases in perceptions of organizational and
   community embeddedness are associated with increases in work-to-family
   conflict and family-to-work conflict over time. Further, we found that
   these effects were even stronger for employees with highly
   individualistic values. Thus, although much of the previous research has
   focused on the positive effects of employee embeddedness for
   individuals' work lives, the present study provides some evidence of the
   potentially negative effects of employee embeddedness for individuals'
   family lives.},

Abstract = {This study extends leader member exchange (LMX) research by

   (N = 68,587) from 23 countries and controlling for extreme response
   style differences indicate that (a) relationships of LMX with
   organizational citizenship behavior, justice perceptions, job
   satisfaction, turnover intentions, and leader trust are stronger in
   horizontal-individualistic (e.g., Western) contexts than in
   vertical-collectivistic (e.g., Asian) contexts; and (b) national culture
   does not affect relationships of LMX with task performance,
   organizational commitment, and transformational leadership. These
   findings highlight that although members are universally sensitive to
   how their leaders treat them, members' responses in Asian contexts may
   also be influenced by collective interests and role-based obligations.},

Abstract = {Although helping behaviors can increase the effectiveness of work units,
   when task interdependence is low, units often develop norms of
   self-interest that inhibit helping. Little research has explained how
   these norms can be changed by a work unit member. We present a minority
   influence framework that specifies how norms can shift in response to a
   challenger's consistent modeling, advocating, or inquiring about helping
   behavior, contingent on prosocial impact, status, similarity, work unit
   agreeableness and openness, and timing. We also examine how normative
   conflict motivates efforts to initiate and sustain challenges, depending
   on identification, status, and small wins. Our model provides a novel
   theoretical account of how helping norms emerge in work units to support
   caring and compassion.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we organize the fragmented management literature on
   technology standards according to a meta-theoretical scheme originally
   proposed by Astley and Van de yen. We review over 89 relevant papers in
   influential journals in management, marketing and management-related
   disciplines. We observe that cumulative research streams on this topic
   have stayed within a single central perspective, that the development of
   research across the four central perspectives has been uneven, and that
   works incorporating multiple central perspectives have been few. We
   argue for complex models that take into account the two boundary
   conditions-technological complexity and institutional environment-that
   have been implicit in the extant literature. We also argue for
   theoretically grounded works in the collective action and strategic
   choice views, but the greatest opportunity lies in integrative works
   that will take us one step closer to a comprehensive view of technology
   standards. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {As organizations globalize, culturally based variation in the ways
   employees conceptualize their relationships with their employers
   increases in importance. In the competition for talent, organizations
   must understand employee preferences and expectations regarding their
   treatment by the firm. Recently, culture's influence on the
   psychological contract (individual perceptions of employer obligations)
   has been noted with regard to the extent that employees perceive their
   psychological contracts as relational or transactional. We provide
   results from a survey conducted in a multinational corporation (MNC)
   indicating that the cultural value of collectivist orientation likely
   has its effect on the psychological contract through beliefs about the
   nature of social exchange. Data were consistent with creditor exchange
   ideology (appropriateness of giving more than has been received)
   mediating the relationship between collectivist orientation and
   perceptions of a relational psychological contract. By examining this
   relationship empirically, we go beyond the demonstration of cultural
   effects to describe an intermediate mechanism through which culture
   operates. Exchange norms are likely to play a mediating role in a
   variety of cross-cultural relationships, and may be used by managers as
   a lever to improve relationships with employees, as opposed to engaging
   in attempts to change individual cultural orientation. Journal of
   International Business Studies (2012) 43, 772-782.

Year = {2012},
Volume = {41},
Number = {7, SI},
Pages = {1240-1248},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The academic field of entrepreneurship research has grown from groups of
   isolated scholars doing research on small businesses to an international
   community of departments, institutes, and foundations promoting research
   on new and high-growth firms. Growth has produced increasingly
   systematic and interconnected knowledge and growing numbers of knowledge
   producers and knowledge users share core concepts, principles, and
   research methods. and a handful of highly cited scholars have emerged as
   thought leaders within research subfields. The field is increasingly
   formalized and anchored in a small set of intellectual bases, although
   there are also some signs of differentiation and fragmentation. Using an
   institutional theory perspective and drawing upon my experience in the
   field, I explore six forces creating the institutional infrastructure.
   First, social networking mechanisms have created a social structure
   facilitating connections between researchers. Second, publication
   opportunities have increased dramatically. Third. training and mentoring
   has moved to a collective rather than individual apprenticeship model.
   Fourth, major foundations and many other smaller funding sources have
   changed the scale and scope of entrepreneurship research. Fifth, new
   mechanisms have emerged that recognize and reward individual
   scholarship, reinforcing the identity of entrepreneurship research as a
   field and attracting new scholars into it. Sixth, globalizing forces
   have affected all of these trends. I conclude with some thoughts about
   the consequences of these developments with regard to the giving of
   practical and timely advice to entrepreneurs, the effects of American
   hegemony on choices of research topics and methods, and the possible
   loss of theoretical eclecticism. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {The economic globalization process has integrated different competitive
   markets and pushes firms in different countries to improve their
   managerial and operational efficiencies. Given the recent empirical
   evidence for the benefits to firms and stakeholders of good corporate
   governance (CG) practice, it is expected that good CG practice would be
   a common strategy for firms in different countries to meet the
   increasingly intense competition; however, this is not the case. This
   study examines the differences in CG practices in firms across different
   countries using the concept of ethical sensitivity. Through the
   regression analysis of 271 firms in 12 countries and regions, it is
   found that Hofstede's cultural dimensions can explain the differences in
   CG practices. Furthermore, the results demonstrate the influence of
   culture on ethical sensitivity, which eventually determines the CG
   practices in different regions.},

Abstract = {In today's dynamic business environment, companies are under tremendous
   pressure to become more innovative and maintain a steady stream of ideas
   that can lead to new and improved products and services. Companies have
   begun to explore the possibility of capturing consumers' ``collective
   intelligence{''} by establishing firm-sponsored online brainstorming
   sites where individuals can share their ideas and offer comments on the
   ideas contributed by others. We term these sites ``Company-Sponsored
   Online Co-Creation Brainstorming{''} (COCB). The value of this open and
   voluntary co-creation depends largely on members' contribution levels,
   the quality of the contributions, and sustained participation. In this
   paper, utilizing Zwass's taxonomy of co-creation value as a base, we
   structure a taxonomic framework of COCBs and an accompanying basic model
   of COCBs. We then present a series of hypotheses concerning the
   relationships between the model's various factors and specific COCB
   activities. We validate the model using empirical data collected over
   two and a half years, starting from the initiation of a pioneering
   company-sponsored online brainstorming site. Our analyses demonstrate
   that the level of peer feedback and the responsiveness (speed) of
   sponsor company feedback have significant influences on both members'
   contribution levels and duration of active participation. The sponsoring
   company's feedback, however, seems to influence only the quality of
   member's contribution level. On the practical side, the outcomes suggest
   that sponsoring companies should develop efficient processes for
   reviewing and responding to submitted ideas. Regarding theory, our
   findings provide an initial piece of contextualized research that offers
   implications for theory building in the COCB context, most notably the
   identification of key relationships between feedback (both peer and
   company) and participant activity levels and duration of participation.},

Abstract = {We suggest that understanding unethical behavior in organizations
   involves understanding how people view themselves and their
   relationships with others, a concept known as self-construal. Across
   multiple studies, employing both field and laboratory settings, we
   examine the impact of three dimensions of self-construal (independent,
   relational, and collective) on unethical behavior. Our results show that
   higher levels of relational self-construal relate negatively to
   unethical behavior. We also find that differences in levels of
   relational self for men and women mediate gender differences in
   unethical behavior. We discuss both the theoretical and practical
   implications of these findings.},

Title = {Organizational Turbulence, Trouble and Trauma: Theorizing the Collapse
   of a Mental Health Setting},
Journal = {ORGANIZATION STUDIES},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {33},
Number = {9, SI},
Pages = {1153-1173},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Turbulence is usually considered a negative property of an
   organization's environment. Yet turbulence is also a feature of an
   organization's internal dynamics and may be useful for productivity.
   This article argues that interactions between the formal and informal
   management of trouble produce relational turbulence that may mobilize
   resources and collective action, or conversely lead to dysfunction and
   crisis. The author links relational psychoanalytic theory with social
   constructionist perspectives in exploring intersubjective dynamics of
   trouble and its repercussions of turbulence. Based on a longitudinal
   interorganizational ethnography, an atypical mental healthcare
   organization is described - a democratic therapeutic community - in
   which turbulence plays a central function, but in two very different
   ways. In a restorative mode, turbulence generates formative spaces that
   are creative and have a regulating function, useful for organizational
   productivity. Conversely, a perverse mode is destructive and may produce
   intractable perverse spaces, leading to organizational dysfunction,
   crisis and even collapse. This is theorized by extending the
   psychoanalytic concept of liminal, transitional space. In contrast to
   the notion of transitional space as a safe, protective area, the author
   develops a model of distinct formative and perverse spaces created by
   relational turbulence in organizations. In human service organizations,
   where the generation, trading and management of trouble are inherent in
   an organization's internal dynamics, turbulence may be a valuable
   resource, but one that, in the perverse mode, can be immensely
   destructive.},

Abstract = {The present meta-analytic study introduces an overall model of the

   65 independent samples (N an 42,907), we found that on-the-job and

   actual turnover, after controlling for job satisfaction, affective
   commitment, and job alternatives. In addition, the negative
   relationships between on-the-job embeddedness (off-the-job embeddedness)
   and turnover criteria were stronger in female-dominated samples and
   public organizations (collectivistic countries). Finally, turnover
   intentions, job search behavior, and job performance fully (partially)
   mediated the effect of on-the-job embeddedness (off-the-job
   embeddedness) on actual turnover. The research and practical
   implications of our findings are noted, in light of study limitations

Abstract = {In the context of the growing popularity of the ethical consumer
   movement and the appearance of different types of ethical collective
   communities, the current article explores the meanings drawn from the
   participation in Responsible Consumption Cooperatives. In existing
   research, the overriding focus has been on examining individual ethical
   consumer behaviour at the expense of advancing our understanding of how
   ethical consumers behave collectively. Hence, this article examines the
   meanings derived from participating in ethical consumer groups. A
   qualitative multi-method approach is adopted to increase the validity of
   findings. This includes focus groups, in-depth interviews, observation
   and document analysis. Results show that ethical consumption in a group
   project offers a greater sense of effectiveness and control when
   compared to individual actions. Furthermore, these groups facilitate the
   creation of a social circle and encourage new learning as a result of
   the social interaction that takes place in the ethical community of the
   cooperative.},

Abstract = {Voluntary management standards for social and environmental performance
   ideally help to define and improve firms' related capabilities. These
   standards, however, have largely failed to improve such performance as

   External pressures can drive firms to adopt standards more than their
   technical capacity to employ them. This can lead to problems of
   ``fit{''} between institutional requirements and a firm's existing
   capabilities. We describe a conceptual model that considers the impact
   of an interaction between a firm's institutional requirements and its
   existing capabilities on standards failure. We suggest solutions that
   align institutional requirements to appropriate governance forms as a
   means to improve standards success. We contribute to theory by
   describing the role of firms' internal capabilities to the success of
   voluntary management standards and the reliability of self-regulation

Abstract = {This study extends research on strategic decision making into the realm
   of strategic alliances by examining the interactive effect of decision
   process characteristics at the firm and alliance levels on alliance
   performance. Located both within and at the boundary between partners,
   alliance-related decision processes have to balance each partner's
   self-interest on one hand and collective actions on the other hand, with
   both partners being dependent on each other's collaboration. Using
   primary, cross-sectional data obtained from 103 high-technology
   alliances, the authors study the effects of procedural rationality and
   politics in decision making. The results corroborate the importance of
   procedural rationality that facilitates collective actions between
   alliance partners but also uncover the pitfall of an unconditional
   reliance on procedural rationality at the firm level. The results
   further show that politically charged decision processes impair decision
   makers' ability to reconcile individual interests both within and
   between alliance partners and therefore jeopardize alliance performance.},

   which various governance mechanisms improve nonprofit reporting quality
   across a broad sample of nonprofit organizations. The financial
   disclosure we examine is the ratio of charitable expenses to total
   expenses, which is one of the most widely used financial metrics to
   measure nonprofit performance. Prior research shows that this ratio is
   manipulated upwards by overstated amounts of charitable expenses. Our
   comprehensive set of governance metrics includes various forms of
   internal and external oversight and monitoring, some of which have just
   become publicly available as a result of the recently enhanced nonprofit
   disclosure environment on governance policies. Our central research
   hypothesis is that stronger governance will result in more accurately
   reported charitable ratios. Our results show that the accuracy of
   reported charitable expenses is increasing in our proxies for the
   distance separating collective ownership and control, board of director
   monitoring, audit quality, capital provider monitoring, and regulatory
   oversight. These findings, many of which are the first of their kind in
   the nonprofit setting, are important for several reasons. First, they
   confirm that existing governance mechanisms improve nonprofit reporting
   quality. Second, users can have more confidence in the financial reports
   of more highly governed organizations. Finally, the results provide
   information to policy makers or boards of directors seeking to enhance
   overall nonprofit financial reporting quality.},

Title = {Stakeholder Duties: On the Moral Responsibility of Corporate Investors},

Volume = {109},

Abstract = {Stakeholder theory usually focuses on the moral responsibility of
   corporations towards their stakeholders. This article takes the reverse
   perspective to shed light on the moral responsibility of
   stakeholders-specifically, investors or `financiers'. It explicates a
   distinction between two types of financiers, creditors and shareholders.
   Many intuitively judge that shareholders have greater or more extensive
   moral responsibility for the actions of the corporations they invest in
   than do bondholders and other creditors. Examining the merits of
   possible arguments for or against treating owners and creditors
   differently elucidates which arguments can support the moral duties of
   investors generally, and different duties for different groups of
   investors specifically. The paper considers three possible lines of
   arguments, rooting investors' responsibility, respectively, in how they
   enable corporate conduct, how they benefit from it, and to what extent
   they are complicit in it. The paper argues that a notion of complicity
   is the only tenable ground for holding investors liable; sketches an
   account of complicity based on the recent philosophical literature on
   collective intention and collective action; and concludes that
   shareholders but not creditors can generally be seen as complicit on
   this account.},

Pages = {3-13},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {This article examines the way that for-profit businesses should take
   into account the interests of the citizens in the liberal democratic
   societies in which they operate. I will show how a contractualist
   version of stakeholder theory identifies the relevant moral interests of
   both shareholders and citizen stakeholders, and provides a method for
   giving their interests appropriate consideration. These include (1) the
   interests that individuals have with respect to private property, (2)
   the interests citizens have in receiving equitable consideration in the
   political process, and (3) citizens' interests which give them the
   collective right to determine the legal and economic structure of their
   societies. Using this contractualist analysis, I argue that corporations
   should consciously take into account the interests of citizen
   stakeholders when there is no other social mechanism for protecting
   their interests as citizens.},

Abstract = {Team mental models (TMMs) have received much attention as important
   drivers of effective team processes and performance. Less is known about
   the factors that give rise to these shared cognitive structures. We
   examined potential antecedents of TMMs, with a specific focus on team
   composition variables, including various facets of personality and
   surface-level diversity. Further, we examined implicit coordination as
   an important outcome of TMMs. Results suggest that team composition in
   terms of the cooperation facet of agreeableness and racial diversity
   were significantly related to team-focused TMM similarity. TMM
   similarity was also positively predictive of implicit coordination,
   which mediated the relationship between TMM similarity and team
   performance. Post hoc analyses revealed a significant interaction
   between the trust facet of agreeableness and racial diversity in
   predicting TMM similarity. Results are discussed in terms of
   facilitating the emergence of TMMs and corresponding implications for

   stories that touch profound aspects of culture and the psyche. They
   reveal what happens when people are asked to imagine a good manager, and
   how this results in tragic ironic representations, rather than tales of

Abstract = {Cross-sector partnerships (XSPs) are an important part of today's
   organizational landscape and a favored strategy for addressing complex
   social problems. However, a discrepancy exists between the popularity
   and prevalence of XSPs and evidence of their ability to produce value
   with respect to the problems they address. We therefore offer a
   framework for increasing and assessing XSP value based on an alternative
   conception of organizational constitution rooted in communication
   theory. Our central argument is that the overall value of XSPs is not
   merely in connecting interested parties but, rather, in their ability to
   act-to substantially influence the people and issues within their
   problem domain. This ability, we argue, comes from the constitution of
   organizational forms that are distinct from their members and that
   display collective agency-the capacity to influence a host of relevant
   outcomes beyond what individual organizations could do on their own. Our
   primary contributions are developing a framework for understanding XSP
   constitution in terms of communication processes and explaining how XSP
   value can be increased and assessed through communication practices.},

Journal = {ORGANIZATION SCIENCE},

Number = {4},
Pages = {951-970},
Month = {JUL-AUG},
Abstract = {Knowledge differences impede the work of cross-functional teams by
   making knowledge integration difficult, especially when the teams are
   faced with novelty. One approach in the literature for overcoming these
   difficulties, which we refer to as the traverse approach, is for team
   members to identify, elaborate, and then explicitly confront the
   differences and dependencies across the knowledge boundaries. This
   approach emphasizes deep dialogue and requires significant resources and
   time. In an exploratory in-depth longitudinal study of three quite
   different cross-functional teams, we found that the teams were able to
   cogenerate a solution without needing to identify, elaborate, and
   confront differences and dependencies between the specialty areas. Our
   analysis of the extensive team data collected over time surfaced
   practices that minimized members' differences during the problem-solving
   process. We suggest that these practices helped the team to transcend
   knowledge differences rather than traverse them. Characteristic of these
   practices is that they avoided interpersonal conflict, fostered the
   rapid cocreation of intermediate scaffolds, encouraged continued
   creative engagement and flexibility to repeatedly modify solution ideas,
   and fostered personal responsibility for translating personal knowledge
   to collective knowledge. The contrast between these two approaches to
   knowledge integration-traverse versus transcend-suggests the need for
   more nuanced theorizing about the use of boundary objects, the nature of
   dialogue, and the role of organizational embeddedness in understanding
   how knowledge differences are integrated.},

Abstract = {Spurred by the consumer demand for companies to be socially responsible,
   cause-related marketing (CM), in which fund raising for a cause is tied
   to purchase of a firm's products, has become popular in recent years.
   The authors demonstrate the conditions in which CM campaigns that allow
   consumers to choose the cause that receives the donation lead to greater
   consumer support than those in which the company determines the cause.
   They show that choice in this context is helpful as long as it increases
   consumers' perception of personal role in helping the cause.
   Specifically, allowing consumers to select the cause in a CM campaign is
   more likely to enhance perceived personal role and, thus, purchase
   intentions (1) for those consumers who are high (vs. low) in
   collectivism and (2) when the company and causes have low (vs. high)
   perceptual fit. Finally, the authors show that under certain conditions,
   choice may have a negative impact on perceived personal role and

Abstract = {In spite of an increasing number of studies on ethical climate, little
   is known about the antecedents of ethical climate and the moderators of
   the relationship between ethical climate and work outcomes. The present
   study conducted firm-level analyses regarding the relationship between
   chief executive officer (CEO) ethical leadership and ethical climate,
   and the moderating effect of climate strength (i.e., agreement in
   climate perceptions) on the relationship between ethical climate and
   collective organizational citizenship behavior (OCB). Self-report data
   were collected from 223 CEOs and 6,021 employees in South Korea. The
   results supported all study hypotheses. As predicted, CEOs' self-rated
   ethical leadership was positively associated with employees' aggregated
   perceptions of the ethical climate of the firm. The relationship between
   ethical climate and firm-level collective OCB was moderated by climate
   strength. More specifically, the relationships between ethical climate
   and interpersonally directed collective OCB and between ethical climate
   and organizationally directed collective OCB were more pronounced when
   climate strength was high than when it was low. Theoretical and
   practical implications of these findings are addressed herein.},

Abstract = {Taking issue with the classical theory of path dependence, we capture
   the active agency involved in collective efforts aimed at extending a
   current technological path and, in parallel, at creating a new path in
   the field of leading-edge international semiconductor manufacturing. We
   apply structuration theory in order to analyse the practices of path
   constitution that traditional evolutionary views of lock-in and
   irreversibility in path processes have neglected. Drawing on 96
   interviews since 2003 and extensive secondary sources in the field of
   semiconductor manufacturing in Europe, Japan and the United States, we
   perform a qualitative, longitudinal and multi-level case analysis; in
   this analysis we trace, in particular, the strategic development of a
   path-extending technological option besides a potentially path-breaking
   new generation of lithography for chip manufacturing systems. Our
   results provide deep insights into the collective and collaborative
   dimension of organizing R\&D in processes of technology development.
   Thereby, we contribute to a theory of technological paths that considers
   collective embedded agency and takes into account interorganizational
   forms for an understanding of the innovation dynamics in science-based
   industries such as semiconductor manufacturing.},

Abstract = {Global brands are faced with the challenge of conveying concepts that
   not only are consistent across borders but also resonate with consumers
   of different cultures. Building on prior research indicating that
   abstract brand concepts induce more favorable consumer responses than
   functional attributes, the authors introduce a generalizable and robust
   structure of abstract brand concepts as representations of human values.
   Using three empirical studies conducted with respondents from eight
   countries, they demonstrate that this proposed structure is particularly
   useful for predicting (1) brand meanings that are compatible (vs.
   incompatible) with each other and, consequently, more (less) favorably
   accepted by consumers when added to an already established brand
   concept; (2) brand concepts that are more likely to resonate with
   consumers with differing cultural orientations; and (3) consumers'
   responses to attempts to imbue an established brand concept with new,
   (in)compatible abstract meanings as a function of their own cultural
   orientations.},

Abstract = {This article uses meta-analytic methods (k = 38) to examine the
   relationship between organizational justice climate and unit-level
   effectiveness. Overall, our results suggest that the relationship
   between justice and effectiveness is significant (rho = .40) when both
   constructs are construed at the collective level. Our results also
   indicate that distributive justice climate was most strongly linked with
   unit-level performance (e.g., productivity, customer satisfaction),
   whereas interactional justice was most strongly related to unit-level
   processes (e.g., organizational citizenship behavior, cohesion). We also
   show that a number of factors moderate this relationship, including
   justice climate strength, the level of referent in the justice measure,
   the hierarchical level of the unit, and how criteria are classified. We
   elaborate on these findings and attempt to provide a clearer direction
   for future research in this area.},

Abstract = {In dynamic collective decision making, current decisions determine the
   future distribution of political power and influence future decisions.
   We develop a general framework to study this class of problems. Under
   acyclicity, we characterize dynamically stable states as functions of
   the initial state and obtain two general insights. First, a social
   arrangement is made stable by the instability of alternative
   arrangements that are preferred by sufficiently powerful groups. Second,
   efficiency-enhancing changes may be resisted because of further changes
   they will engender. We use this framework to analyze dynamics of
   political rights in a society with different types of extremist views.

Abstract = {Much organizational identity research has grappled with the question of
   identity emergence or change. Yet the question of identity endurance is
   equally puzzling. Relying primarily on an analysis of 309 internal
   bulletins produced at a French aeronautics firm over almost 50 years, we
   theorize a link between collective memory and organizational identity
   endurance. More specifically, we show how forgetting in a firm's ongoing
   rhetorical history-here, the bulletins' repeated omission of
   contradictory elements in the firm's past (i.e., structural omission) or
   attempts to neutralize them with valued identity cues (i.e., preemptive
   neutralization)-sustains its identity. Thus, knowing ``who we are{''}
   might depend in part on repeatedly remembering to forget ``who we were

Abstract = {In this study, we analyze how the organizational architecture of a
   multibusiness firm affects the adaptation of its constituent business
   units. Using an inductive analysis of GE's governance system from 1951
   to 2001, we examine how the integration of corporate and business unit
   attention occurs within and across the firm's governance channels. Our
   theory identifies an unexplored aspect of the M-form's architecture:
   collective vertical interactions between the corporate office and
   business units through cross-level channels. Overall, we articulate
   three types of channel integrationcross-level, cross-functional, and
   channel couplingand examine their effects on responsiveness to threats
   and opportunities. We find that despite an elaborate organizational
   architecture, there were periods when GE's governance system did not
   allow for coordination of corporate and business unit agendas. Our
   theory proposes that the temporal coupling of specialized, cross-level
   channels creates an organizational architecture that is both
   differentiated and integrated. This architecture integrates levels and
   issues simultaneously, yet focuses attention sequentially, providing
   more effective conditions for joint attention and coordination between
   the corporation office and the business unit and adaptive change at the
   business unit level. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Journal = {RESEARCH POLICY},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {41},
Number = {5},
Pages = {848-861},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {This study rests upon the premise that differences in the productivity
   performance of multinational enterprises (MNEs) stem from variations in
   their ability to access and combine globally distributed knowledge
   reservoirs within one organization. Its contribution lies in
   demonstrating that this important source of variation is determined by
   (a) the idiosyncratic manner in which the MNE's network of subsidiaries
   is structured. (b) the international breadth and depth of this network
   and (c) its location choices in the global landscape. We find that when
   multinationals spread their operations across many geographical markets,
   they benefit from knowledge externalities more than when they
   concentrate their activities in few countries. We further show that the
   ability to exploit spatially distant knowledge depends not only on
   idiosyncrasies specific to the MNE, but also on exogenous forces
   associated with international variations in appropriability regimes and
   industry-specific technological opportunities. As our study considers
   how the subsidiaries of the MNE collectively influence the productivity
   of the entire group, it captures complementarities and synergies within
   the group, and deepens understanding of how MNE-specific and location
   bound factors jointly shape performance outcomes. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

   Surveying members of 172 teams confirms most of our hypothesized
   effects. Our results show that economic citizenship influences team
   performance via the mediation of both team efficacy and team
   self-esteem. However, legal citizenship influences team performance via
   team efficacy alone, whereas ethical citizenship influences team
   performance only via team self-esteem. We discuss the theoretical and

Title = {UNDERSTANDING USER REVISIONS WHEN USING INFORMATION SYSTEM FEATURES:
   ADAPTIVE SYSTEM USE AND TRIGGERS},
Journal = {MIS QUARTERLY},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {36},
Number = {2},
Pages = {453-478},

Abstract = {Post-adoptive system use is often characterized by cycles of adaptation,
   in which people actively revise how they use information systems. This
   paper investigates how and why individual users revise their system use
   at the feature level. A new concept, adaptive system use (ASU), is
   conceptualized as a user's revisions of which and how system features
   are used. This research identifies four specific ASU behaviors that
   collectively describe how people revise their use of system features. A
   model of ASU is developed based on Louis and Sutton's (1991) research on
   how people switch to active thinking from automatic thinking. The model
   specifies three antecedents of ASU (novel situations, discrepancies, and
   deliberate initiatives) and two moderators (personal innovativeness in
   IT and facilitating conditions). An empirical study of 253 Microsoft
   Office users largely supported the research model. The findings suggest
   that triggers-including novel situations, discrepancies, and deliberate
   initiatives are a significant impetus to ASU. This research also
   confirms moderating effects of personal innovativeness in IT: The
   findings also show the relationships among triggers: in addition to
   their direct impact on ASU, novel situations and deliberate initiatives
   exert their influence on ASU indirectly by giving rise to discrepancies
   in system use. Moreover, a cluster analysis identifies three
   heterogeneous triggering conditions and reveals that people engage in
   different ASU behaviors under different triggering conditions.},

Abstract = {Disparity in consumer ethics reflects cultural variations; these are
   differences in the collective programming of the mind that distinguishes
   one culture from another. This study explores the differences in
   consumer ethics across cultural dimensions using Hofstede's (in
   Culture's consequences: international differences in work-related
   values, Sage, Beverly Hills, 1980) model (collectivism, masculinity,
   power distance, and uncertainty avoidance) and Muncy and Vitell (in J
   Bus Res 24(4):297-311, 1992) consumer ethics model (i.e., illegal,
   active, passive, and no harm). This is the first study to empirically
   explore consumer ethics using these two major constructs. Seven hundred
   sixty one African American consumers were used to test the four major
   hypotheses developed in this study. Current research has revealed that
   there are significant differences in ethics between consumers who score
   high and consumers who score low on Hofstede's four cultural dimensions.
   In general, this research revealed that consumers who score high on
   collectivism, high on uncertainty avoidance, low on masculinity, and low
   on power distance scales reject questionable activities more than
   consumers who score low on collectivism, low on uncertainty avoidance,
   high on masculinity, and high on power distance. This study should prove
   valuable to international marketers because the Hofstede cultural model
   allows managers to identify differences in consumer ethics across
   different cultures and thus provides a theoretical base for designing
   effective marketing strategies.},

   SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT},
Journal = {MIS QUARTERLY},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {36},
Number = {2},
Pages = {649-676},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Open source software (OSS) is a social and economic phenomenon that
   raises fundamental questions about the motivations of contributors to
   information systems development. Some developers are unpaid volunteers
   who seek to solve their own technical problems, while others create OSS
   as part of their employment contract. For the past 10 years, a
   substantial amount of academic work has theorized about and empirically
   examined developer motivations. We review this work and suggest
   considering motivation in terms of the values of the social practice in
   which developers participate. Based on the social philosophy of Alasdair
   MacIntyre, we construct a theoretical framework that expands our
   assumptions about individual motivation to include the idea of a
   long-term, value-informed quest beyond short-term rewards. This
   motivation practice framework depicts how the social practice and its
   supporting institutions mediate between individual motivation and
   outcome. The framework contains three theoretical conjectures that seek
   to explain how collectively elaborated standards of excellence prompt
   developers to produce high-quality software, change institutions, and
   sustain OSS development. From the framework, we derive six concrete
   propositions and suggest a new research agenda on motivation in OSS.},

Abstract = {The bold lines that have separated the application of specific
   production planning and control techniques to specific production
   systems are being blurred by continuous advances in production
   technologies and innovative operational procedures. Oral communication
   among dispatchers and production units has given way to electronic
   communication between production planners and these units by continuous
   progress in information technologies. Current production literature
   alludes to the idea that, collectively, these advances have paved the
   way for application of Just-In-Time (JIT) production concepts, which
   were originally developed for mass production systems, in intermittent
   production systems. But this literature does not actually consider the
   possibility. This article presents a modification to JIT procedures to
   make them more suitable for jumbled-flow shops. This article suggests
   providing real-time information about net-requirements for each product
   to each work center operator for setting production priorities at each
   work center. Simulation experiments conducted for this study show that
   using Net-Requirements in JIT (NERJIT) reduces customer wait time by
   4560\% while reducing inventory slightly. The analysis of work centers
   input and output stock-point inventories shows that using the
   information about net-requirements results in production of items that
   are in current demand. NERJIT results in smaller input stock-point
   inventory and availability of products with higher priority in the
   output stock-points of work centers.},

Abstract = {This study empirically investigated culture's consequences on employee
   perceptions of the performance implications of financial and
   non-financial rewards. Using a sample (n = 568) drawn from the banking
   industry in Finland and Hong Kong, we found that although the effects
   and predictive capability of culture (i.e. masculinityfemininity,
   individualismcollectivism, uncertainty avoidance, and power distance)
   offered some important insights, a range of other contextual factors
   (i.e. organizational, institutional, economic) wielded influence over
   and shaped rewardperformance values, preferences, and behaviours. The
   emergence of these new paradigms necessitates that the US centric
   economic and behavioural theories (e.g. exchange) that underpin
   rewardperformance be revisited and extended if they are to be applicable
   in the international context. Understanding the influence of a range of
   contextual forces is therefore critical to multinational organizations
   attempting to implement effective reward strategies aimed at achieving a
   diverse set of performance priorities. In addition to these novel
   theoretical and practical contributions, this study also paves the way
   for future research in this promising area of management studies.},

Volume = {51},

Abstract = {This article compares and contrasts the Renault-Nissan and
   DaimlerChrysler-Mitsubishi mergers to consider the relative and combined
   effects of national and organizational culture on the performance of
   Nissan and Mitsubishi. It also examines the reasons why the
   Renault-Nissan merger was successful and the DaimlerChrysler-Mitsubishi
   merger failed. It finds that Japanese national culture influenced
   organizational culture and HRM practices, which created organizations
   that had no sense of urgency, profit orientation, or accountability and
   led to poor market and financial performance. It also finds that
   leadership was a major factor impacting on the success of the turnaround
   efforts of these two organizations. These findings have implications for
   leaders and human resource management practitioners engaged in
   international business and are of particular relevance to Western
   organizations working with organizations in high-context countries with
   a collectivist rather than individualist orientation. (c) 2012 Wiley

Abstract = {Adopting a person by situation interaction approach, we identified
   conditions under which conformity pressure can either stifle or boost
   group creativity depending on the joint effects of norm content and
   group personality composition. Using a 2 x 2 x 2 experimental design, we
   hypothesized and found that pressure to adhere to an individualistic
   norm boosted creativity in groups whose members scored low on the
   Creative Personality Scale (Gough, 1979), but stifled creativity in
   groups whose members scored high on that measure. Our findings suggest
   that conformity pressure may be a viable mechanism for boosting group
   creativity, but only among those who lack creative talent. (C) 2011

Abstract = {This paper examines the type and temporal development of language in the
   process of corporate responsibility (CR) standardization. Previous
   research on CR standardization has addressed the proliferation and
   organizational embedding of material practices but neglected the
   analysis of underlying ideational dynamics. Departing from this
   practice, we introduce a narrative perspective that illuminates the
   trajectory a CR standard follows, from being formally adopted to
   becoming collectively accepted as a valid solution to a problem of
   societal concern. We argue that this perspective helps scholars explore
   the dynamic interplay between symbolic and material aspects of
   standardization and understand better the discursive antecedents of
   coupling processes in organizations. Drawing on the case of the Equator
   Principles standard in international project finance, we empirically
   study how narratives create meaning shared by both business firms and
   their societal observers, thereby exemplifying the analytical merit of a
   narrative approach to CR standardization.},

Abstract = {The academic debate over the propriety of attributing moral
   responsibility to corporations is decades old and ongoing. The
   conventional approach to this debate is to identify the sufficient
   conditions for moral agency and then attempt to determine whether
   corporations possess them. This article recommends abandoning the
   conventional approach in favor of an examination of the practical
   consequences of corporate moral responsibility. The article's thesis is
   that such an examination reveals that attributing moral responsibility
   to corporations is ethically acceptable only if it does not authorize
   the punishment of corporations as collective entities, and further, that
   this renders the debate over corporate moral responsibility virtually
   pointless.},

   from boundary objects to facilitate adaptive learning and collaboration
   for solving complicated problems in interactive systems. Our analysis
   contributes to theories of cross-boundary spanning, adaptive learning,

Abstract = {Incidences of organizational wrongdoing have become wide spread
   throughout the whole business world. The management of organizational
   wrongdoings is of growing concern in organizations globally, since these
   types of acts can be detrimental to financial well being. Wrongdoing
   occurs within organizational settings and organizational members
   commonly have knowledge of and thus the opportunity to report the
   wrongdoing. An employee's decision to report individual or
   organizational misconduct, i.e. blow the whistle, is a complex
   phenomenon that is based upon organizational, situational and personal
   factors. The purpose of this study is to examine the relationship
   between value orientations of individuals and choices for particular
   whistleblowing modes. Our results show that there are significant
   relationships between these variables. We contribute to the extant
   literature by choosing Turkey as context as most studies have been
   conducted in the US and Europe, and little has been reported about the
   actions taken by employees in non-Western cultures when they observe
   wrongdoing in their organizations.},

Volume = {33},
Number = {5-6, SI},

Abstract = {The growing number of voluntary standards for governing transnational
   arenas is presenting standards organizations with a problem. While
   claiming that they are pursuing shared, overarching objectives, at the
   same time they are promoting their own respective standards that are
   increasingly similar. By developing the notion of `standards markets',
   this paper examines this tension and studies how different social
   movement and industry-driven standards organizations compete as well as
   collaborate over governance in transnational arenas. Based on an
   in-depth case study of sustainability standards in the global coffee
   industry, we find that the ongoing co-existence of multiple standards is
   being promoted by the interplay between two countervailing mechanisms:
   convergence and differentiation. In conjunction, these mechanisms are
   enabling the emergence and persistence of a market for standards through
   what we describe as meta-standardization of sustainable practices.
   Meta-standardization leads to convergence at the `rules of the game'
   level, but allows also differentiation at the attributes level, which is
   enabling parties to create and maintain their own standards. Our study
   helps to advance the understanding of transnational governance by
   explaining the dynamics of competing and collaborating non-state actors
   in constituting a standards market.},

Abstract = {Surveying 6509 managers from 24 countries/geopolitical entities, we
   tested the process through which individualism-collectivism at the
   country level relates to employees' appraisals of and reactions to three
   types of work demands (i.e., work hours, workload, and organizational
   constraints). Our multilevel modeling results suggested that, while
   working the same number of hours, employees from individualistic
   countries reported a higher perceived workload than their counterparts
   in collectivistic countries. Furthermore, relationships of perceived
   workload and organizational constraints with job dissatisfaction and
   turnover intentions were stronger in individualistic than in
   collectivistic countries. Importantly, results of supplementary analyses
   suggested that the cultural value of individualism-collectivism
   moderated the mediation effect of perceived workload between work hours
   and both job dissatisfaction and turnover intentions. Our findings
   highlight the need to expand contemporary theories of work stress by
   applying multilevel approaches and incorporating cross-national
   differences in dimensions such as individualism-collectivism while
   studying how employees appraise and react to important work stressors.

Abstract = {The sensitivity of stock options' payoff to return volatility, or vega,
   provides risk-averse CEOs with an incentive to increase their firms'
   risk more by increasing systematic rather than idiosyncratic risk. This
   effect manifests because any increase in the firm's systematic risk can
   be hedged by a CEO who can trade the market portfolio. Consistent with
   this prediction, we find that vega gives CEOs incentives to increase
   their firms' total risk by increasing systematic risk but not
   idiosyncratic risk. Collectively, our results suggest that stock options
   might not always encourage managers to pursue projects that are
   primarily characterized by idiosyncratic risk when projects with
   systematic risk are available as an alternative. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {The authors propose a symbolic instrumental interactive framework of
   consumer brand identification (CBI) and explore its predictiveness
   across 15 countries. Using multinational data, they show that the
   negative impact of the misalignment between self brand congruity and

   perceived quality, and uncertainty avoidance orientation in motivating
   consumers' identity-sustaining behavior is weak. However, the synergy
   between CBI and perceived quality in motivating consumers'
   identity-promoting behavior is stronger among collectivist consumers.
   The authors derive a typology of symbolic-instrumental misalignments to
   help international marketing managers motivate consumers to identify

Volume = {79},
Number = {2},
Pages = {812-837},

Abstract = {Why is it difficult to restructure sovereign debt in a timely manner? In
   this paper, we present a theory of the sovereign debt-restructuring
   process in which delay arises as individual creditors hold up a
   settlement in order to extract greater payments from the sovereign. We
   then use the theory to analyse recent policy proposals aimed at ensuring
   equal repayment of creditor claims. Strikingly, we show that such
   collective action policies may increase delay by encouraging free riding
   on negotiation costs, even while preventing hold-up and reducing total
   negotiation costs. A calibrated version of the model can account for
   observed delays and finds that free riding is quantitatively relevant:
   whereas in simple low-cost debt-restructuring operations, collective
   mechanisms will reduce delay by more than 60\%, in high-cost complicated
   restructurings, the adoption of such mechanisms results in a doubling of
   delay.},

Abstract = {Existing accounts of leadership are underpinned by two dominant
   approaches: functionalist studies, which have tried to identify
   correlations between variables associated with leadership; and
   interpretive studies, which have tried to trace out the meaning-making
   process associated with leadership. Eschewing these approaches, we turn
   to an emerging strand of literature that develops a critical approach to
   leadership. This literature draws our attention to the dialectics of
   control and resistance and the ideological aspect of leadership.
   However, it largely posits a negative critique of leadership. We think
   this is legitimate and important, but extend this agenda. We posit a
   performative critique of leadership that emphasizes tactics of
   circumspect care, progressive pragmatism and searching for present
   potentialities. We use these tactics to sketch out a practice of
   deliberated leadership that involves collective reflection on when, what
   kind and if leadership is appropriate.},

Abstract = {CEO inside debt holdings (pension benefits and deferred compensation)
   are generally unsecured and unfunded liabilities of the firm. Because
   these characteristics of inside debt expose the CEO to default risk
   similar to that faced by outside creditors, theory predicts that CEOs
   with large inside debt holdings will display lower levels of
   risk-seeking behavior (Jensen and Meckling, 1976). Consistent with the
   theoretical predictions, we find a negative association between CEO
   inside debt holdings and the volatility of future firm stock returns,
   R\&D expenditures, and financial leverage, and a positive association
   between CEO inside debt holdings and the extent of diversification and
   asset liquidity. Collectively, our results provide empirical evidence
   suggesting that CEOs with large inside debt holdings prefer investment
   and financial policies that are less risky. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All

   these individuals may face special challenges in fulfilling this role.
   We discuss how three factors-the general social status associated with a
   specific demographic characteristic, the demographic composition of the
   work group, and the differential prestige accorded within organizations
   to work groups-interact to impact individuals' concerns about being
   considered valued members of work groups to which they belong (i.e.,
   value threat). Based on an integration of sociological and psychological
   theories, we argue that value threat adversely affects individuals'
   propensity to support demographically similar others in selection and
   promotion processes. We identify three forms that value threat may take
   in situations involving such personnel decisions: collective threat,
   favoritism threat, and competitive threat, and we specify factors that
   may shape the intensity of each form.},

Journal = {RESEARCH POLICY},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {41},
Number = {2},
Pages = {452-466},

Abstract = {We propose a conceptual framework to analyze technology adoption in mega
   infrastructure projects, and assess their potential to innovating large
   socio-technical systems. Drawing on an in-depth empirical analysis of
   Heathrow airport's Terminal 5 project, we find that innovation hinges on
   technology adoption decisions that are governed systematically by two
   intertwined determinants - assessment of expected profitability and
   development of absorptive capacity, both of which are distributed across
   various interdependent actors. On an ad hoc basis, technological
   decisions are also affected by other factors, namely attitudes toward
   risk, politics, and (lack of) established standards. We reveal how a
   schedule-driven project framing creates an underlying boundary condition
   that constrains the longitudinal process of building a `whole
   collective' with capacity to absorb new technologies. The innovation
   potential of mega projects is thus subjected to a fundamental, unifying
   tension: on the one hand, they offer a one-off opportunity to invest in
   cutting-edge technologies and innovate socio-technical systems: on the
   other hand, project stakeholders have limited time to develop capacity
   to absorb novel technologies and negotiate differences on assessments of
   profitability and risk. Stakeholders may therefore be compelled to agree
   to adopt proven technologies upfront to reduce uncertainty and mitigate
   risks, thus limiting the innovation potential of new infrastructure
   development. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Knowledge Beyond the Individual? Making Sense of a Notion of Collective
   Knowledge in Organization Theory},

Abstract = {Although the notion of `collective knowledge' has become a building
   block of many knowledge-based studies on the organization, there is
   little clarity about the precise meaning of the term. This paper aims at
   closing this explanatory gap by investigating the question of what it
   can mean for knowledge to be collective. In drawing on relevant
   literatures it analytically distinguishes three types of collective
   knowledge and elaborates on their nature. Through analysis of their
   interrelationship and interaction within the organization, these types
   are integrated into an overarching framework forming a pluralistic
   epistemology of collective knowledge. Finally, some implications of the
   proposed epistemological framework for our understanding of higher-order
   knowledge-related constructs (such as routines and capabilities) as well
   as for the architecture of firms and industries are outlined.},

Title = {Going Concerns: The Governance of Interorganizational Coordination Hubs},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEMS},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {28},
Number = {4},
Pages = {163-197},
Month = {SPR},
Abstract = {Business-to-business interactions are increasingly conducted through
   interorganizational coordination hubs, in which standardized information
   technology-based platforms provide data and business process
   interoperability for interactions among the organizations in particular
   industrial communities. Because the governance of interorganizational
   arrangements is believed to affect their efficiency and effectiveness,
   this paper explores how and why interorganizational coordination hubs
   are governed. Analysis of relevant prior theory and case examples shows
   that coordination hub governance is designed to balance the sometimes
   conflicting needs for capital to invest in new technology, for
   participation of industry members, and for the protection of data
   resources. Findings suggest that the governance of interorganizational
   coordination hubs is not the starkly categorical choice between
   collective (member-owned) and investor-owned forms as suggested by prior
   theory. Instead, many hybrid arrangements are observed in the five
   examined cases. Future theoretical development and empirical research
   are needed to understand the increasingly important phenomenon of
   coordination hub governance.},

Abstract = {This work extends the consideration of spirituality and leadership to
   the field of strategic leadership. Future development in the field of
   spirituality and leadership will depend on greater clarity concerning
   the level of analysis, and will require a distinction between personal
   and collective spirituality. Toward that end, a framework is proposed
   that describes how the personal spiritual beliefs of a top level leader
   operate in strategic decision making like a schema to filter and frame
   information. This function is mediated by the leader's constructive
   development and meta-belief and moderated by the organizational context
   and leadership style. This framework provides a starting point for
   considering the many expressions of spirituality in organizations and
   serves as a foundation for a multi-level theory of spirituality and
   leadership.},

Abstract = {The authors use a multilevel framework to introduce peer-based control
   as a motivational state that emerges in self-managing teams. The authors
   specifically describe how peer-based rational control, which is defined
   as team members perceiving the distribution of economic rewards as
   dependent on input from teammates, extends and interacts with the more
   commonly studied normative control force of group cohesion to explain
   both individual and collective performance in teams. On the basis of
   data from 587 factory workers in 45 self-managing teams at 3
   organizations, peer-based rational control corresponded with higher
   performance for both individuals and collective teams. Results further
   demonstrated that the rational and normative mechanism of peer-based
   control interacted to explain performance at both the individual and
   team levels. Increased peer-based rational control corresponded with
   higher individual and collective performance in teams with low cohesion,
   but the positive effects on performance were attenuated in cohesive
   teams.},

Abstract = {Does a society's culture affect its rate of inventive activity? This
   article analyzes several independent datasets of culture and innovation
   from 62 countries spanning more than two decades. It finds that most
   measures of individualism have a strong, significant, and positive
   effect on innovation, even when controlling for major policy variables.
   However, the data also suggest that a certain type of collectivism (i.e.
   patriotism and nationalism) can also foster innovation at the national
   level. Meanwhile, other types of collectivism (i.e. familism and
   localism) not only harm innovation rates, but may hurt progress in
   science worse than technology. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Journal = {ADMINISTRATIVE SCIENCE QUARTERLY},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {57},
Number = {1},
Pages = {119-155},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Here we propose an account of the link between exchange structure and
   the emergence of solidarity capable of accounting for the conflicting
   evidence social scientists have found regarding the relationship between
   social exchange structures and the emergence of intangible, effectively
   laden group sentiments. We argue that benefits received through exchange
   foster group identification and solidarity but that this effect is
   stronger in generalized exchange systems-in which giving and receiving
   of resources occurs unilaterally among three or more individuals than
   direct exchange systems which feature reciprocal transfers of resources
   between two people. At low levels of benefit to recipients, generalized
   and direct exchange systems will produce similarly low levels of group
   identification. At high levels of benefit, however, generalized exchange
   will result in relatively higher levels of identification. Higher levels
   of identification leads individual members in turn to view the group as
   higher in solidarity. We find support for this mediated moderation model
   in two survey-based case studies of organizations designed to facilitate
   these forms of exchange: one of Freecycle, a large-scale, online
   generalized exchange system, the other of Craigslist, a comparable
   direct exchange system. The results further suggest that generalized
   exchange is likely to emerge where a critical mass of exchange benefits
   creates positive sentiments toward the group, sentiments that help fuel
   further contributions in the exchange system.},

Abstract = {Utilizing a data set on the client portfolios of the Big 4 audit
   partners in Sweden, this study examines auditor specialization and
   pricing at the individual partner level. Consistent with the view that
   there are returns on investing in specialization, the analysis of audit
   fees indicates that both audit partner industry specialization and
   specialization in large public companies are recognized and valued by
   financial statement users and/or by corporate insiders, resulting in
   higher fees within these engagements. The highest fees are earned by
   engagement partners who are both industry and public firm specialists.
   Collectively, the findings of this study indicate that part of an
   auditor's deep expertise is not transferable across audit partners
   within an audit firm but is instead inseparably tied to the individual
   audit partner's private human capital.},

Abstract = {This study provides empirical evidence on the role of disclosure in
   resolving agency conflicts in delegated investment management. For
   certain expenditures, fund managers have alternative means of payment
   which differ greatly in their opacity: payments can be expensed
   (relatively transparent): or bundled with brokerage commissions
   (relatively opaque). We find that the return impact of opaque payments
   is significantly more negative than that of transparent payments.
   Moreover, we find a differential flow reaction that confirms the opacity
   of commission bundling. Collectively, our results demonstrate the
   importance of transparency in addressing agency costs of delegated

Abstract = {The article shows that time-consistent, imperfectly targeted support to
   distressed institutions makes private leverage choices strategic
   complements. When everyone engages in maturity mismatch, authorities
   have little choice but intervening, creating both current and deferred
   (sowing the seeds of the next crisis) social costs. In turn, it is
   profitable to adopt a risky balance sheet. These insights have important
   consequences, from banks choosing to correlate their risk exposures to
   the need for macro-prudential supervision.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ETHICS},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Businesses and the social sciences are increasingly facing calls to
   further scholarship dedicated to understand sustainability. Furthermore,
   multinationals are also facing similar calls given their high profile
   and their role in environmental degradation. However, a literature
   review shows that there is very limited understanding of sustainability
   at a cross-national level. Given the above gaps, we contribute to the
   literature by examining how selected GLOBE {[}House et al., Culture,
   leadership and organizations: The GOBE study of 62 societies. Sage
   Publications, Thousand Oaks, 2004] cultural dimensions are related to
   individuals' propensity to support sustainability initiatives in 33
   countries. We use data from the World Values Survey {[}World Values
   Study Group, World Values Surveys and European Value Surveys, 1999-2001.
   Inter-University Consortium for Political and Social Research, Ann
   Arbor, 2004] and test our hypotheses using Hierarchical Linear Modeling
   (HLM). Results support all but one hypothesis. Specifically, uncertainty
   avoidance is not related to propensity to support sustainability
   initiatives. In contrast, performance orientation and assertiveness have
   the desired negative relationship with our dependent variable while
   collectivism, future orientation, and human orientation have the desired
   positive relationship. We discuss the conceptual and practical
   implications of this study.},

Title = {Ethical Issues in Outsourcing: The Case of Contract Medical Research and

Volume = {105},
Number = {2},
Pages = {239-255},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The outsourcing of medical research has become a strategic imperative in
   the global pharmaceutical industry. Spurred by the challenges of
   competition, the need for speed in drug development, and increasing
   domestic costs, pharmaceutical companies across the globe continue to
   outsource critical parts of their value chain activities, namely
   contract clinical research and drug testing, to sponsors across the
   globe, typically into emerging markets. While it is clear that important
   ethical issues arise with this practice, unraveling moral responsibility
   and the allocation of responsibility is not so clear, considering that
   contracts, by their very definition transfer responsibility from the
   principal to the agent. This research provides a framework for exploring
   some of the ethical issues, including attributions of moral
   responsibility associated with Contract Medical Research. Using a theory
   of strategic and moral behavior, the research shows that both clients
   and sponsors in contract research have individual and collective
   responsibility to ensure that due care and diligence is exercised in the
   performance of clinical research. The research suggests some guidelines
   for stakeholder action.},

Abstract = {This commentary addresses the functional properties of perceived

   four theoretical orientations. These include social cognitive theory
   rooted in an agentic perspective, control theory grounded in a
   cybernetic model, and trait self-efficacy theory and Big Five theory
   based on a decontextualized trait model. Critical analyses of the
   studies in question document their failure to fulfill key theoretical,
   methodological, analytical, and construct assessment requirements. The
   article extends beyond critical analyses of the published studies. It
   specifies the theoretical, methodological, and analytical requirements
   essential to the advancement of knowledge on the role that perceived
   self-efficacy plays in human self-development, adaption, and change at
   both the individual and collective levels.},

Year = {2012},
Volume = {27},
Number = {1},
Pages = {95-111},

Abstract = {Why does the level of venture capital activity vary across countries?
   This study suggests that the variation can be attributed to the
   different levels of formal institutional development. Further, this
   study proposes that venture capitalists respond differently to the
   incentives provided by formal institutions depending on different
   cultural settings. Analysis of VC activity for 68 countries during the
   1996-2006 period shows that formal institutions have a positive effect
   on the level of venture capital activity, but this effect is weaker in
   more uncertainty-avoiding societies and in more collectivist societies.
   This study has useful theory and policy implications for venture capital
   and entrepreneurship development. Published by Elsevier Inc.},

Volume = {117},

Abstract = {We extend Gelfand and Realo's (1999) argument that accountability
   motivates negotiators from relationally-focused cultures to use a more
   pro-relationship approach during negotiations. Our research shows that
   the effect they predict is found only when the other negotiating partner
   is an in-group member. Specifically, in two studies involving
   participants from China (a relationally-focused culture) and the US (a
   less relationally-focused culture), we found that only when negotiating
   with an in-group member are Chinese participants under high
   accountability more likely to use a pro-relationship approach than those
   under low accountability. Consequently, the differences between Chinese
   and American participants in the use of a pro-relationship approach
   occur only when they negotiate with an in-group member under high
   accountability. The strong attention to relationships, however, results
   in higher fixed-pie perceptions and lower joint gains. The implications
   of our findings for theory and practice are discussed. (C) 2011 Elsevier

Abstract = {Although researchers have theorized that there exists a curvilinear

   research has been tested in the United States or culturally similar
   Switzerland. Through a study of the performance turnover relationship
   from a multinational service-oriented organization in 24 countries, we
   demonstrate that the general relationship between performance and
   turnover is similar across countries but the details of that
   relationship change across countries. Using 4 cultural
   dimensions-in-group collectivism, power distance, uncertainty avoidance,
   and performance orientation-we find that cultural factors alter the
   overall probability of voluntary turnover and influence the degree of
   curvilinearity in the performance-turnover relationship. Our findings

   relevance when developing new standards (e.g., fair value accounting).
   However, prior empirical evidence on industry-specific measures and on
   pro forma earnings does not provide consistent guidance as to how
   investors assess such tension. We investigate a novel unaudited non-GAAP
   performance measure, distributable cash. Distributable cash is the
   primary performance indicator disclosed by income trusts, a flow-through
   entity which became a popular investment vehicle after 2000. It purports
   to represent the amount of cash an income trust is capable of
   distributing to its investors on a sustaining basis. We find that
   distributable cash is deemed to be value relevant by investors, actually
   relegating audited GAAP earnings to a secondary role. However,
   distributable cash's measurement is subject to extensive managerial
   discretion, is unaudited, and is unverifiable by investors. In this
   regard, we document that reported levels of distributable cash exhibit a
   smoothing pattern, thus ensuring stable cash distributions to investors.
   We show also that managerial incentives (stock option holdings) and
   corporate governance (board and ownership) variables affect the level of
   reported distributable cash. Finally, after estimating the discretionary
   and nondiscretionary components of distributable cash, we find that
   their value relevance is similar. We infer from this finding that
   investors, lacking details about underlying measurement assumptions, do
   not seem able to see through managerial opportunism and seem to focus on
   distributable cash as reported. Because the valuation of income trusts,
   collectively worth more than \$200 billion at their peak, relies
   significantly on distributable cash, our results suggest that unaudited
   non-GAAP performance measures can play an important role in capital
   markets. However, our results also indicate such measures need to be
   closely monitored by boards and regulators, thus cautioning accounting
   standard setters against their current emphasis value relevance over
   reliability.},

Abstract = {Strategic change initiatives disrupt established categories of
   stakeholder understanding and typically present a problem of justifying
   and legitimizing the change to stakeholders in order to gain their
   buy-in and support. While it has been suggested that the analogical or
   metaphorical framing of strategic changes is crucial in that it fosters
   understanding and creates legitimacy for the change, we set out to
   specify the conditions and uses of analogical and metaphorical framing
   in effecting support for strategic changes. Specifically, we argue that
   (a) analogies are more effective in the context of additive changes,
   whereas metaphors are more apt for substitutive changes, and that (b)
   relational analogies and metaphors are generally more effective in
   securing support for strategic changes, as opposed to analogies or
   metaphors that highlight common attributes. We also argue that the
   overall effectiveness of analogies and metaphors in the framing of a
   change is furthermore dependent on (c) the degree to which these frames
   are culturally familiar to stakeholders and (d) the extent to which they
   connect with the prior motivations of stakeholders.},

Volume = {35},

Abstract = {Virtually all of the extensive previous research investigating the
   effect of information systems proficiency on performance has been
   conducted at the individual level. Little research has investigated the
   relationship between IS proficiency and performance at the group level.
   In this paper, we argue that IS proficiency at the group level may be
   more than the simple sum or average of the IS proficiency of individual
   group members. Rather, effective group-level IS proficiency may also be
   afiinction of how a group's IS proficiency is distributed across its
   members. Relying on concepts associated with social network analysis
   (SNA), we introduce the concept of centrality-IS proficiency alignment.
   We argue that groups will perform better if their more proficient
   members are highly central in the group's communication and workflows
   network. Data from 468 employees in 32 workgroups show that
   centrality-IS proficiency alignment is significantly and positively
   related to performance across multiple systems examined individually and
   with the portfolio of systems examined as a whole. This approach
   effectively integrates the structural and resource perspectives of SNA,
   providing a roadmap so that others may follow a similar approach to
   address broader questions of group-level user system interactions in the
   IS literature and more general questions of central resource alignment
   in the broader organizational literature.},

   stocks, broad-based employee stock option plans are more popular, the
   initial day return following an initial public offering is higher, and
   the magnitude of the negative lottery-stock premium is larger.

Abstract = {The literature on top-down strategy implementation has overlooked
   social-emotional factors. The results of a three-year field study of a
   large technology firm show how top executives who favor an affect
   neutral task approach can inadvertently activate middle managers'
   organization-related social identities, such as length of time working
   for the company (newcomers versus veterans) and language spoken by
   senior executives (English versus French), generating group-focus
   emotions. These emotions prompt middle managers-even those elevated to
   powerful positions by top executives-to support or covertly dismiss a
   particular strategic initiative even when their immediate personal
   interests are not directly under threat. This study contributes to the
   strategy implementation literature by linking senior executives' actions
   and middle managers' social identities, group-focus emotions, and
   resulting behaviors to strategy implementation outcomes. Copyright (C)

Number = {12},
Pages = {94+},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {In the past few years, some companies have not just weathered the
   economic storm: They've emerged stronger than ever. How did such players
   as Four Seasons, Sephora, and Standard Chartered Bank defy conventional
   logic? Instead of pursuing a single ambition, such as profits, employees
   defined a collective ambition. As a result, those organizations deepened
   their engagement with employees and other stakeholders and became
   sustainably profitable.
   Purpose, a company's reason for existence, is the central element of
   collective ambition. The other elements vision, targets and milestones,
   strategic and operational priorities, brand promise, core values, and
   leader behaviors must be aligned to serve the company's purpose.
   Articulating the elements of collective ambition can give everyone in
   the organization a better sense of the company's purpose and how they
   can contribute to it. Purpose does not have to be about saving the
   world; providing excellent entertainment or banking services is just as
   meaningful a purpose as improving health care in emerging economies as
   long as it is an authentic representation of why the company exists.
   To shape and then achieve a collective ambition, companies must
   strengthen their organizational glue (the collaborative engagement that
   creates a unified culture) and grease (the disciplined execution that
   enterprisewide change initiatives require).},

Abstract = {In recent times, whistleblowing has become one of the most popularly
   debated issues of business ethics. Popular discussion has coincided with
   the institutionalisation of whistleblowing via legal and administrative
   practices, supported by the emergence of academic research in the field.
   However, the public practice and knowledge that has subsequently
   developed appears to construct a dichotomy of whistleblowing/silence;
   that is, an employee elects either to `blow the whistle' on
   organisational wrongdoing, or remain silent. We argue that this public
   transcript of whistleblowing/silence overshadows the importance of
   continuing research into alternative (individual or collective) employee
   behaviour. Drawing on original research with a financial services
   organisation, our research uncovers a dissenting discourse that operates
   through implicit communication, such as codes, sarcasm and jokes. We
   suggest that this hidden transcript offers significant opportunities for
   employees to act ethically, and offers the potential to sustain an
   ethical organisational culture.},

Abstract = {Despite the increasing importance of financial and social remittances to
   developing countries, their impact on home-country venture-investing
   environments has been largely overlooked. I develop a framework grounded
   in transaction costs economics and social knowledge theories to
   investigate relationships between remittances and home-country (1)
   capital availability, (2) new business creation, and (3) economic
   internationalization. My framework also accounts for individual and
   collective immigrant attributes that may moderate the impact of
   remittances on these alternative indicators of the venture investment
   environment. Analyses of immigrant remittances to 61 developing
   countries from 2002-2007 indicate that they increase general and more
   narrowly defined venture capital availability as well as broader
   openness to international trade. Remittances also increase new business
   start-up rates when the developing country's public sector is
   sufficiently small. Positive venture-funding effects of remittances are
   magnified when coming from immigrants living in highly concentrated
   communities, but are diminished when coming from highly educated
   immigrants. Overall, results suggest that developing-country immigrants
   of varying backgrounds play an important role in venture funding,
   founding and integration with the world economy. Journal of

Abstract = {This paper explores how new institutional fields are established and
   extended. We argue that they are created by social movements engaging in
   hegemonic struggles and which develop social movement strategies,
   articulate discourses and construct nodal points. We examine how this
   process played out during the creation and development of the Slow Food
   movement. We argue that the positioning of Slow Food as a new field was
   based particularly on using multiple strategies, increasing the stock of
   floating signifiers, and abstracting the nodal points used. This
   mobilized new actors and enabled a more extensive collective identity
   which allowed the movement to progress, extend, and elevate the field of
   Slow Food. The field of Slow Food was transformed from appealing only to
   gastronomes to becoming a broader field that encompassed social justice
   activists and environmentalists. This study contributes to the existing
   literature on field formation, the role of social movements in this
   process, and political dynamics within social movements. We focus on the
   importance of hegemony in the institutional processes around field
   formation by drawing out how Slow Food created a field through the
   forging of hegemonic links among a range of disparate actors.},

Volume = {48},
Number = {7},

Abstract = {In 1993, Mats Alvesson published `Organizations as Rhetoric'. In his
   paper, Alvesson proposed that knowledge was ambiguous and that rhetoric
   was therefore critical to the construction and operation of institutions
   and organizations. Moreover, he argued that in such an ambiguous and
   thus rhetorical world, knowledge operated as an institutionalized myth
   and rationality surrogate. Alvesson's insights helped inspire and
   initiate one of the most promising and growing areas of institutional
   research: rhetorical institutionalism. Rhetorical institutionalism is
   the deployment of linguistic approaches in general and rhetorical
   insights in particular to explain how institutions both constrain and
   enable agency. In this paper, we trace these original insights and
   discuss the benefits of continuing the integration of rhetorical ideas
   in institutional research. In addition, we propose and develop a
   rhetorical model of institutionalism that can spearhead research and
   conclude with some direct suggestions for future research.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF APPLIED PSYCHOLOGY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {96},
Number = {6},
Pages = {1289-1304},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Updating and extending the work of O'Leary-Kelly, Martocchio, and Frink
   (1994), with this meta-analysis on goal setting and group performance we
   show that specific difficult goals yield considerably higher group
   performance compared with nonspecific goals (d = 0.80 +/- 0.35, k = 23
   effect sizes). Moderately difficult and easy goals were also associated
   with performance benefits relative to nonspecific goals, but these
   effects were smaller. The overall effect size for all group goals was d
   = 0.56 +/- 0.19 (k = 49). Unexpectedly, task interdependence, task
   complexity, and participation did not moderate the effect of group
   goals. Our inventory of multilevel goals in interdependent groups
   indicated that the effect of individual goals in groups on group
   performance was contingent upon the focus of the goal: ``Egocentric{''}
   individual goals, aimed at maximizing individual performance, yielded a
   particularly negative group-performance effect (d = -1.75 +/- 0.60, k =
   6), whereas ``groupcentric{''} goals, aimed at maximizing the individual
   contribution to the group's performance, showed a positive effect (d =
   1.20 +/- 1.03, k = 4). These findings demonstrate that group goals have
   a robust effect on group performance. Individual goals can also promote
   group performance but should be used with caution in interdependent
   groups. Future research might explore the role of multilevel goals for
   group performance in more detail. The striking lack of recent field
   studies in organizational settings that emerged from our brief review of
   trends in group goal-setting research should be taken into account when
   designing future studies in this domain.},

   tie strength, structural holes, and opportunity recognition. Results
   indicate that in the United States, tie strength is negatively

Year = {2011},
Volume = {50},
Number = {6, SI},
Pages = {783-808},
Month = {NOV-DEC},
Abstract = {Following abundant anecdotal evidence of low morale in mergers and its
   important detrimental effect on postmerger performance, the purpose of
   this multimethod experimental study was to find out how employee
   reactions to a merger evolve over time following peer interaction (i.e.,
   discussion with colleagues). Using a scenario study, initial reactions
   to a merger announcement were compared with socially influenced
   reactions. As anticipated, an overall strong detrimental effect of peer
   interaction on employee reactions was observed. Next, findings indicate
   that deal characteristics (culture clash potential, announced degree of
   integration, and position in deal structure) play a moderating role.
   Indeed, how peer interaction affects outcomes depends on the position in
   the deal structure. Qualitative data analysis of the group discussions
   sheds light on how employee reactions become more detrimental. This
   process is conceptualized as ``collective rumination,{''}defined as
   repetitively and passively discussing organizational problems and their
   negative consequences with a group of peers. The study concludes with
   implications for practice and identifies three powerful levers (active
   involvement, distraction, and positive leadership) to influence the way
   in which employees react to the event. (C) 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

Abstract = {This article provides current Schwartz Values Survey (SVS) data from
   samples of business managers and professionals across 50 societies that
   are culturally and socioeconomically diverse. We report the society
   scores for SVS values dimensions for both individual- and societal-level
   analyses. At the individual-level, we report on the ten circumplex
   values sub-dimensions and two sets of values dimensions (collectivism
   and individualism; openness to change, conservation, self-enhancement,
   and self-transcendence). At the societal-level, we report on the values
   dimensions of embeddedness, hierarchy, mastery, affective autonomy,
   intellectual autonomy, egalitarianism, and harmony. For each society, we
   report the Cronbach's alpha statistics for each values dimension scale
   to assess their internal consistency (reliability) as well as report
   interrater agreement (IRA) analyses to assess the acceptability of using
   aggregated individual level values scores to represent country values.
   We also examined whether societal development level is related to
   systematic variation in the measurement and importance of values. Thus,
   the contributions of our evaluation of the SVS values dimensions are
   two-fold. First, we identify the SVS dimensions that have
   cross-culturally internally reliable structures and within-society
   agreement for business professionals. Second, we report the society
   cultural values scores developed from the twenty-first century data that
   can be used as macro-level predictors in multilevel and single-level
   international business research.},

   profitability. The paper challenges this perspective by developing a
   concept of learnt social practices, a methodology for theorizing the
   social and subjectively creative capacities of accounting as a practice
   embedded in social relations; collective activities through which
   individuals shape wider meaningful realities, potentially reshaping
   their own needs and understandings. The methodology develops through an
   ethnographic analysis of the empresas recuperadas - worker cooperatives
   formed as a grass roots initiative within a wider societal movement in
   Argentina, which responded to economic and political crises in 2001 by
   creating new organizational and institutional practices. By analyzing
   descriptions and observations of social interactions and dialogues, the
   paper identifies and explains how accounting practices can distort
   communication, but can also push individuals to clarify their concerns
   through the constitution of social consensus. Building on attempts to
   theorize social order and diversity, the paper concludes by formulating
   a concept of the conscious, relational activities through which
   accounting practices represented and constructed a form of
   inter-dependency that was sensitive to the needs and understandings of
   individuals. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Organizations increasingly rely on teams to formulate plans and respond
   in critical situations. However, current models of team process are
   insensitive to the effects of team strategic orientation. This paper
   expands existing work on team process and strategic orientation to
   introduce and explicate the constructs of offensive and defensive
   strategic orientations in teams. It takes advantage of a rare
   opportunity to observe eight counterterrorism teams in the intelligence
   community that explicitly adopted an offensive or defensive strategic
   orientation in evaluating terrorist threats. The resulting inductive
   model suggests that the strength of a team's strategic orientation was
   enhanced or inhibited by its perception of oppositional strength and the
   problem scope it assumed in confronting the adversary. This in turn had
   effects on the work strategy the teams adopted, the extent to which they
   relied on internal versus external knowledge, and the norms for effort
   that evolved within the teams. The observations suggest broader
   theoretical implications for research on teams, as the ``offense{''} and
   ``defense{''} strategic orientations influence fundamental team
   processes related to effort, performance strategy, and use of member
   knowledge and skill.},

Title = {The Dialectical Sense of Humour: Routine Joking in a Taylorized Factory},
Journal = {ORGANIZATION STUDIES},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {32},
Number = {10},
Pages = {1421-1439},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Starting from the premise that context is central to understanding
   humour, the paper examines humour in three key contexts of the workplace
   - the labour process, control relations and peer relations. The paper
   argues that there have been important studies which have shown humour
   embedded in control relations and peer relations, but the way in which
   humour may be embedded in the labour process has not received the same
   sustained attention. The paper reports on a participant-observation
   ethnography in a Taylorized blinds factory in which humour embedded in
   the labour process was the central form of humour. Particularly
   important were forms of humour categorized as `routine humour' and
   `routine absurdity' in which workers played with the routine labour
   process. Overall, the humour in this factory primarily had resistive
   meanings, and contributed to an autonomous shopfloor culture which
   informed acts of informal collective resistance. At the same time, much
   of the humour lubricated the enactment of the labour process. The paper
   contributes to knowledge by drawing on Bergson to offer a theoretical
   framing for, and extending our understanding of, humour embedded in the
   labour process. Specifically, it suggests the importance of the
   dialectical sense of humour - humour which enacts the labour process,
   while having implicitly resistive meanings.},

Number = {5},
Pages = {1144-1156},
Month = {SEP-OCT},
Abstract = {Most research on organization-based identities focuses on a single level
   of analysis, typically the individual, group, or organization. As a spur
   to more cross-level identity research, we offer speculative discussions
   on two issues concerning nested identities. First, regarding the
   processes through which identities become linked across levels, we
   explore how identities at one level of analysis enable and constrain
   identities at other levels. We argue that, for a collective identity,
   intrasubjective understanding ({''}I think{''}) fosters intersubjective
   understanding ({''}we think{''}) through interaction, which in turn
   fosters generic understanding-a sense of the collective that transcends
   individuals ({''}it is{''}). Second, regarding the content of linked
   identities, we suggest that identities are relatively isomorphic across
   levels because organizational goals require some internal coherence.
   However, for various intended and unintended reasons, isomorphism is
   often impeded across levels, and identities tend to become somewhat
   differentiated.},

Abstract = {Since the 1991 publication of the first Journal of Management special
   issue devoted to resource-based inquiry, resource-based theory (RBT) has
   evolved from a nascent, upstart perspective to one of the most prominent
   and powerful theories for understanding organizations. Indeed, 20 years
   after that landmark issue, RBT appears to have reached maturity as a
   theory. One implication of this maturity is that RBT lies at a critical
   juncture, one that will be followed either by revitalization of the
   theory or by its decline. In this introductory article, the authors
   provide a brief overview of the contributions provided by the
   commentaries and articles contained in this third Journal of Management
   special issue on RBT. These contributions center on five themes:
   interlinkages with other perspectives, processes of resource acquisition
   and development, the micro-foundations of RBT, RBT and sustainability,
   and method and measurement issues. Their view is that the commentaries
   and articles collectively offer a foundation for extending RBT in
   meaningful new directions and steering clear of decline. They also offer
   their thoughts about some key opportunities within each of the themes
   for further revitalizing research involving the RBT.},

Month = {SEP-OCT},
Abstract = {This paper reviews the scholarly literature on the effects of social
   hierarchy-differences in power and status among organizational actors-on
   collective learning in organizations and groups. We begin with the
   observation that theories of organization and group learning have tended
   to adopt a rational system model, a model that emphasizes goal-directed
   and cooperative interactions between and among actors who may differ in
   knowledge and expertise but are undifferentiated with respect to power
   and status. Our review of the theoretical and empirical literatures on
   power, status, and learning suggests that social hierarchy can
   complicate a rational system model of collective learning by disrupting
   three critical learning-related processes: anchoring on shared goals,
   risk taking and experimentation, and knowledge sharing. We also find
   evidence to suggest that the stifling effects of power and status
   differences on collective learning can be mitigated when advantaged
   actors are collectively oriented. Indeed, our review suggests that
   higher-ranking actors who use their power and status in more
   ``socialized{''} ways can play critical roles in stimulating collective
   learning behavior. We conclude by articulating several promising
   directions for future research that were suggested by our review.},

   special challenges in fulfilling this role. I examine how the prestige
   accorded to the work group and their numerical representation interact
   to impact women's concerns about being considered valued members of
   their groups and hence, their propensity to support other women in the
   selection process. I conducted three studies which showed that women
   will abdicate the opportunity to support highly or moderately qualified
   female candidates as potential work group peers. Furthermore, the
   concern that a highly qualified female candidate will be seen as more of
   a valued group member (competitive threat) and that a moderately
   qualified female candidate will adversely affect their value by
   reinforcing negative stereotypes about their demographic category
   (collective threat) partially mediated the relationship between
   numerical representation and work group prestige and women's preference
   for other women as work group peers. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {This paper investigates fire sales of downgraded corporate bonds induced
   by regulatory constraints imposed on insurance companies. As insurance
   companies hold over one-third of investment-grade corporate bonds, the
   collective need to divest downgraded issues may be limited by a scarcity
   of counterparties. Using insurance company transaction data, we find
   that insurance companies that are relatively more constrained by
   regulation are more likely to sell downgraded bonds. Bonds subject to a
   high probability of regulatory-induced selling exhibit price declines
   and subsequent reversals. These price effects appear larger during
   periods when the insurance industry is relatively distressed and other
   potential buyers' carpital is scarce. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {This study extends multisource feedback research by assessing the
   effects of rater source and raters' cultural value orientations on
   rating bias (leniency and halo). Using a motivational perspective of
   performance appraisal, the authors posit that subordinate raters
   followed by peers will exhibit more rating bias than superiors. More
   important, given that multisource feedback systems were premised on low
   power distance and individualistic cultural assumptions, the authors
   expect raters' power distance and individualism-collectivism
   orientations to moderate the effects of rater source on rating bias.
   Hierarchical linear modeling on data collected from 1,447 superiors,
   peers, and subordinates who provided developmental feedback to 172
   military officers show that (a) subordinates exhibit the most rating
   leniency, followed by peers and superiors; (b) subordinates demonstrate
   more halo than superiors and peers, whereas superiors and peers do not
   differ; (c) the effects of power distance on leniency and halo are
   strongest for subordinates than for peers and superiors; (d) the effects
   of collectivism on leniency were stronger for subordinates and peers
   than for superiors; effects on halo were stronger for subordinates than
   superiors, but these effects did not differ for subordinates and peers.
   The present findings highlight the role of raters' cultural values in
   multisource feedback ratings.},

Abstract = {Academic journal reviewing is a form of collective action that creates a
   public good, and as such, it represents a social dilemma with
   cooperation being essential to the reviewing process. Cooperation in
   this social dilemma is a function of the perceived costs and benefits to
   the potential reviewer. However, those perceived costs and benefits are
   personally perceived and in turn may be influenced by the frame
   reviewers bring to the decision to review. Frames may differ in the
   extent to which they lead reviewing to be viewed as an in-role duty or
   an extra-role choice, and the extent to which they lead reviewers to
   focus only on consequences to the self or consequences to others as
   well. Also critical in this dilemma are the frames of editors who must
   invite participation by reviewers and the frames of universities who
   legitimate reviewer behaviors. Some ``obvious{''} solutions to the
   volunteer dilemma of reviewing may have paradoxical effects on reviewer
   cooperation if such frames are not considered. The importance of frame
   analysis for understanding volunteer dilemmas is addressed.},

   actions shape the field. Second, the article illustrates how the
   multi-actor and contested nature of the equality and diversity field
   manifests in these accounts, and presents evidence in support of policy
   and strategic thinking that goes beyond a single-actor focus. Finally,
   we contribute to the theoretical maturity and expansion of the equality

Abstract = {E-business standards are a key infrastructure for electronic commerce.
   In many industries, they are collaboratively developed by firms in an
   open and neutral industry consortium. It is imperative to understand
   what drives firms' resource investments in such consortia, as they are
   critical for the success of e-business standardization. Based on
   collective action theory, we propose a research model to investigate the
   drivers of standard development within consortia. We test the model
   through a data set of 232 firms from 7 consortia. Consistent with
   collective action theory, our results demonstrate that firms' interests,
   resource availability, and consortium management effectiveness jointly
   determine their resource expenditures within the consortium. However,
   our exploratory investigation indicates differences between vendors and
   users, as vendors are more motivated by perceived standard benefits
   whereas users are more motivated by perceived process benefits. Our
   research provides a deeper understanding of firms' behaviors within
   consortia and factors driving their standard making.},

Abstract = {Many markets have historically been dominated by a small number of
   best-selling products. The Pareto principle, also known as the 80/20
   rule, describes this common pattern of sales concentration. However,
   information technology in general and Internet markets in particular
   have the potential to substantially increase the collective share of
   niche products, thereby creating a longer tail in the distribution of
   sales. This paper investigates the Internet's ``long tail{''}
   phenomenon. By analyzing data collected from a multichannel retailer, it
   provides empirical evidence that the Internet channel exhibits a
   significantly less concentrated sales distribution when compared with
   traditional channels. Previous explanations for this result have focused
   on differences in product availability between channels. However, we
   demonstrate that the result survives even when the Internet and
   traditional channels share exactly the same product availability and
   prices. Instead, we find that consumers' usage of Internet search and
   discovery tools, such as recommendation engines, are associated with an
   increase the share of niche products. We conclude that the Internet's
   long tail is not solely due to the increase in product selection but may
   also partly reflect lower search costs on the Internet. If the
   relationships we uncover persist, the underlying trends in technology
   portend an ongoing shift in the distribution of product sales.},

Abstract = {To resolve ``the innovation paradox,{''} we examined whether cognitive
   styles associated with idea implementation (i.e., conformity and
   attention to detail) have an influence on team radical innovation that
   goes above and beyond the contribution of creative members. We also
   examined mediating team processes. Using data on 41 teams in an R\&D
   company, we found that including creative and conformist members on a
   team enhanced team radical innovation, whereas including
   attentive-to-detail members hindered it. Creative members enhanced task
   conflict and hindered team adherence to standards. In contrast,
   conformists reduced task conflict, and conformists and
   attentive-to-detail members enhanced team adherence to standards. Team
   potency mediated the effect of the cognitive styles on innovation.},

Volume = {64},

Abstract = {Drawing on models of competing values and self-verification theory, this
   article proposes that social dominance orientation (SDO) and
   psychological collectivism (PC) represent contrasting values that
   motivate opposing workplace interpersonal behaviors. SDO values are
   hypothesized to motivate interpersonal deviance and the avoidance of
   interpersonal citizenship as these behaviors verify social dominance as
   a guiding self-principle. PC values are hypothesized to motivate
   behaviors that verify collectivism as a guiding self-principle,
   including interpersonal citizenship and the avoidance of interpersonal
   deviance. Further, drawing on the values activation literature, abusive
   supervision is hypothesized to moderate the values-to-behavior
   relationships. In a cross-organizational sample of 490 working adults,
   SDO was positively related to interpersonal deviance and negatively
   related to interpersonal citizenship. Highly abusive supervision
   strengthened, whereas minimally abusive supervision weakened
   relationships with SDO. PC values were positively related to
   interpersonal citizenship, but were unrelated to interpersonal deviance
   and did not interact with abusive supervision.},

Title = {Exercising Social Responsibility in Downsizing: Enrolling and Mobilizing

Journal = {ORGANIZATION STUDIES},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {32},

Abstract = {This paper critically examines the claim made by previous research that
   companies exercise corporate social responsibility (CSR) by responding
   to stakeholder interests. It is based on a field study of the events
   following the announcement of collective redundancies at a Swedish
   high-tech company. Although more than 10,000 workers were dismissed, the
   company was accepted as being socially responsible. The study reveals
   that this outcome was the result of a process whereby corporate
   representatives managed to enrol and mobilize a network of actors into
   being faithful to, and defending, their definition of social
   responsibility. This indicates that a company can assume an active role
   in the construction of the same network of actors that it is asked to
   respond to and impose upon other actors its own definition of what it
   means to be socially responsible. As a result, the translation of CSR
   within the network of actors may reinforce the powerful position of the
   company, rather than curb it.},

Abstract = {Project forms of organizing are theorized to rely upon horizontal as
   opposed to vertical lines of authority, but few have examined how this
   shift affects progression-how people advance in an organization. We
   argue that progression without hierarchy unfolds when people assume
   lateral authority over project tasks without managing people. With a
   longitudinal study of a mature, collectively managed open source
   software project, we predict the individual behaviors that enable
   progression to lateral authority roles at two different stages. Although
   technical contributions are initially important, coordination work is
   more critical at a subsequent stage. We then explore how lateral
   authority roles affect subsequent behavior-after gaining authority,
   individuals spend significantly more time coordinating project work. Our
   research shows how people progress to the center as opposed to up a
   hierarchy, and how progression differs by stage and specifies the
   theoretical relationship between lateral authority roles and the
   coordination of project work.},

Abstract = {The scope and purpose of this special issue is to draw interconnections
   between domains of strategy and strategic management research.
   Specifically, we initially conceptualized this special issue with two
   goals in mind: (1) to highlight and bridge intersections between
   strategy theories and bodies of scholarship; and (2) to advance and
   mainstream ways in which an explicit organizational dimension can be
   fostered in strategy and strategic management research. The papers
   selected for the issue capture this set of aspirations in various ways,
   and, as such, they collectively offer a foundation for extending
   strategy and strategic management research in exciting new directions.
   We start our introduction by providing a brief overview of the
   contributions provided by each paper in the context of three broad
   strategy themes: strategy and process; resources and organizational
   growth; and environment and institutional context. We subsequently
   discuss the potential for integration of research across these themes,
   and highlight the importance of what we define as bridging and umbrella
   constructs that are able to connect various strategy and organizational
   phenomena in coherent and meaningful ways. We elaborate the important
   distinction between these two constructs and their respective roles ill
   theory development, and use that to drive and articulate directions for
   further research.},

Title = {Strength in Numbers: Networks as a Solution to Occupational Traps},
Journal = {REVIEW OF ECONOMIC STUDIES},

Volume = {78},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {The ``new classical{''} theory states that families in low-skill
   occupations with low levels of human capital can stay poor from one
   generation to the next, while families in high-skill occupations with
   correspondingly high levels of human capital stay wealthy, despite being
   endowed with the same level of ability on average. This paper proposes
   an informal institutional mechanism-the community-based network-through
   which families belonging to the same neighbourhood or kinship group can
   bootstrap their way out of such low-skill occupational traps. The
   insight from the dynamic model that is developed is that once they form,
   new networks providing mutual support to their members and substituting
   for inherited parental human capital and wealth will strengthen most
   rapidly in historically disadvantaged communities, generating a
   correspondingly high level of intergenerational mobility. These
   predictions are successfully tested using unique data from India. The
   analysis in this paper, coupled with an emerging empirical literature on
   networks and migration, provides a new perspective on mobility in
   developing countries, with restrictive traditional networks decaying
   even as new networks supporting collective mobility form and strengthen

Title = {Psychological Pathways to Fraud: Understanding and Preventing Fraud in

Volume = {101},
Number = {4},

Abstract = {In response to calls for more research on how to prevent or detect fraud
   (ACAP, Final Report of the Advisory Committee on the Auditing
   Profession, United States Department of the Treasury, Washington, DC,
   2008; AICPA, SAS No. 99: Consideration of Fraud in a Financial Statement
   Audit, New York, NY, 2002; Carcello et al., Working Paper, University of
   Tennessee, Bentley University and Kennesaw State University, 2008;
   Wells, Journal of Accountancy, 2004), we develop a framework that
   identifies three psychological pathways to fraud, supported by multiple
   theories relating to moral intuition and disengagement, rationalization,
   and the role played by negative affect. The purpose of developing the
   framework is twofold: (1) to draw attention to important yet
   under-researched aspects of ethical decision-making, and (2) to increase
   our understanding of the psychology of committing fraud. Our framework
   builds on the existing fraud triangle (PCAOB, Consideration of fraud in
   a financial statement audit. AU Section 316, www.pcaobus.org, 2005)
   which is used by auditors to assess fraud risk. The fraud triangle is
   composed of three factors that, together, predict the likelihood of
   fraud within an organization: opportunity, incentive/pressure, and
   attitude/rationalization. We find that, when faced with the opportunity
   and incentive/pressure, there are three psychological pathways to fraud
   nestled within attitude/rationalization: (1) lack of awareness, (2)
   intuition coupled with rationalization, and (3) reasoning. These
   distinctions are important for fraud prevention because each of these
   paths is driven by a different psychological mechanism. This framework
   is useful in a number of ways. First, it identifies certain insidious
   situational factors in which individuals commit fraud without
   recognizing it. Second, it extends our knowledge of rationalization by
   theorizing that individuals use rationalization to avoid or reduce the
   negative affect that accompanies performing an unethical behavior.
   Negative affect is important because individuals wish to avoid it.
   Third, it identifies several other methods fraudsters use to reduce
   negative affect, each of which could serve as potential ``psychological
   red flags{''} and helps predict future fraudulent behavior. Finally, our
   framework can be used as a theoretical foundation to explore several
   interventions designed to prevent fraud.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT STUDIES},

Volume = {48},
Number = {5, SI},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {In this paper I report the findings of an inductive, interpretative case
   study of proactive and autonomous actions instigated by a group at a
   major pharmaceutical firm in order to accelerate and shape
   organizational capability at this firm. This two-year field research was
   seen as an ideal vehicle for investigating wig a group within a firm
   proactively engages with a pattern of capability development, how such
   proactive engagement is conducted, and what these proactive activities
   are. I assert that autonomous action originates from intra-firm
   heterogeneity of group-level cognitive frames and social identities. The
   evidence suggests that a group with a particularly distinct perception
   of the strategic value of a capability will be more likely to initiate
   autonomous action with the aim of making an impact on capability
   development. The likelihood of autonomous action increases further if a
   group acts to strengthen the distinctiveness of its own identity by
   raising the perceived value of a capability that compares unfavourably
   with other firms' capabilities. The field observations suggest that in
   circumstances of high inter-group dependency and limited group
   authority, the group attempts to make an impact on capability
   development by adopting creative and socially complex framing practices.
   The group formalizes a collective and cognitive search process in order
   to legitimize the preferred action and subtly sells the issue to higher
   authority without causing conflict, while still sustaining the group's
   intent.},

Title = {The Impact of Economic Contractions on the Effectiveness of R\&D and
   Advertising: Evidence from US Companies Spanning Three Decades},
Journal = {MARKETING SCIENCE},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {30},
Number = {4},
Pages = {628-645},
Month = {JUL-AUG},
Abstract = {The critical role of research and development (R\&D) and advertising in
   the marketing strategy of the firm is well established. This paper
   conceptually and empirically examines why and how much the effectiveness
   of these two marketing instruments differs between times of economic
   expansions versus periods of economic contractions-and whether these
   results depend on the cyclicality of the industry in question. We
   consider a key marketing metric (market share) and a key financial
   metric (firm profit). Our empirical setting is 1,175 U. S. firms across
   a time period spanning over three decades. We find that R\&D and
   advertising contribute to firm performance but that their effectiveness
   is not constant across the business cycle. Increasing advertising share
   in contractions has a stronger effect on profit and market share than
   increasing advertising share in expansions. Likewise, investments in
   R\&D in contractions lead to higher gains in market share and profit
   than R\&D investments in expansions, albeit only in subsequent years. If
   in contractions the firm faces tight budget constraints and has to
   choose between either maintaining R\&D or advertising, our simulation
   results show that maintaining R\&D is associated with better company
   performance. We find that advertising effectiveness, in general, and in
   contractions, in particular, is systematically moderated by the degree
   of cyclicality of the industry in which the firm operates. In relatively
   stable industries, advertising effects are small or even nonsignificant,
   and they do not go beyond the year the firm advertises. However, in
   highly cyclical industries, advertising effects are long-lasting, its
   total effect being 50\% larger (market share) and 200\% larger (profits)
   than in industries of average cyclicality. The effect of industry
   cyclicality on advertising effectiveness is especially pronounced in
   contractions. Collectively, these findings provide valuable and
   actionable insights into how firms should respond to contractions in
   order to grow profits and market share.},

Abstract = {In the early 2000s, faced with an alarming gap between its growth goals
   and what its innovation pipeline was delivering, Procter \& Gamble
   created a ``new-growth factory{''} a network of novel structures and
   capabilities to rapidly shepherd new products and even business models
   from inception to market. The resulting innovations range from a n-cent
   razor for customers in emerging economies to Tide Dry Cleaners
   establishments with drive-through windows and 24-hour drop-off and
   pickup.
   Brown, who is P\&G's chief technology officer, and Anthony describe the
   factory's components and practices: new-business-creation groups,
   entrepreneurial ``guides{''} to help them, an innovation manual, a
   disruptive-innovation ``college,{''} and more. They also offer six
   lessons for leaders seeking to set up new-growth factories of their own.
   Although the factory is still ramping up, its early successes suggest
   that collective creativity can be managed and can generate sustainable
   sources of revenue growth no matter how big a company becomes.},

Abstract = {Understanding innovation depends at root on good qualitative
   descriptions. This paper re-assesses the role of ``bricolage{''}, and
   the extent of science-based R\&D and experience-based learning, in the
   development of the Danish wind turbine system. It argues that the
   competition between these two opposed frames of reference was never
   conclusively settled, but involved a reassertion of science-based R\&D,
   which was ultimately decisive for long-term success. This adds a
   dimension to the received account by showing the persistence of
   contested collective frames of reference as a driving force across the
   technology life cycle. At the same time, a more nuanced account of these
   two learning processes enhances theorisation of the innovation process
   by showing a learning sequence and interplay of modes that is
   diametrically at odds with the conventional stylised model of the

Abstract = {Phenomenography is proposed here as a qualitative methodology for
   investigating how owner-managers practise internationalisation in small
   firms, and it is applied in an empirical study of internationalising
   owner-managed small Australian wineries. The findings show a common
   internationalisation activity cycle but four qualitatively different
   ways in which these owner-managers practise internationalisation. We
   reveal that this variation in owner-manager internationalisation
   practices is determined by their understandings of internationalisation,
   which produce differences in the ways activities within their
   internationalisation activity cycle are orchestrated. In particular,
   phenomenography has enabled new insights into the multiplicity of firm
   internationalisation practices not able to be captured through other
   qualitative methodologies such as ethnography or semiotics, as they are
   not designed to capture such variation. Based on our findings, we
   propose an understanding-based theory to explain the idiosyncratic
   nature of owner-managed small firm internationalisation. Furthermore, we
   suggest that phenomenography, used independently or in conjunction with
   other qualitative methodologies, also has potential to reveal the
   varying practices of internationalising large MNEs by enabling an
   investigation of the collective or shared understanding of firm
   internationalisation within MNEs. Finally, we point out how
   phenomenography can be extended beyond firm internationalisation
   practices to investigate other topics within international business.

   use process. This paper seeks to build a theoretical framework drawing
   on the concepts and the analytical tool of complex adaptive systems
   (CAS) theory. The paper presents a CAS model of IT use that encodes a
   bottom-up IT use process into three interrelated elements: agents that
   consist of the basic entities of actions in an IT use process,
   interactions that refer to the mutually adaptive behaviors of agents,
   and an environment that represents the social organizational contexts of
   IT use. Agent-based modeling is introduced as the analytical tool for
   computationally representing and examining the CAS model of IT use. The
   operationability of the CAS model and the analytical tool are
   demonstrated through a theory-building exercise translating an
   interpretive case study of IT use to a specific version of the CAS
   model. While Orlikowski (1996) raised questions regarding the impacts of
   employee learning, IT flexibility, and workplace rigidity on IT-based
   organization transformation, the CAS model indicates that these factors
   in individual-level actions do not have a direct causal linkage with
   organizational-level IT use patterns and outcomes. This theory-building
   exercise manifests the intriguing nature of the bottom-up IT use
   process: collective-level IT use patterns and outcomes are the logical
   and yet often unintended or unforeseeable consequences of
   individual-level behaviors. The CAS model of IT use offers opportunities
   for expanding the theoretical and methodological scope of the IT use
   literature.},

Abstract = {In recent years, knowledge management has been utilized as an essential
   strategy to foster the creation of organizational intellectual capital.
   Organizational intellectual capital can be derived both individually and
   collectively in the process to create, store, share, acquire, and apply
   personal and organizational knowledge. However, some organizations only
   focus on the development of public good, despite the concerns arising
   from individuals' self-interest or possible risks. The different concern
   of individual and collective perspectives toward knowledge management
   inevitably leads to ethical conflicts and ethical culture in the
   organization (Jarvenpaa et al., J Manage Inf Syst 14(4):29-64, 1998;
   Ruppel and Harrington, IEEE Trans Prof Commun 44(1):37-52, 2000). The
   purpose of this study is to examine the ethical climate within the
   organization and its possible influence on members' evaluation,
   satisfaction, engagement, and job performance with respect to knowledge
   management practice. The research results reveal that several types of
   organizational ethical climate coexist in the organization and have
   different degrees of influence on employees' attitude as well as
   participation in knowledge management activities. In this article, we
   argue the importance of organizational ethical climate and highlight the
   implications of such a climate for facilitating knowledge management.},

   Lottery estimates show large and significant score gains for charter

   pilot school students are mostly small and insignificant, with some
   significant negative effects. Charter schools with binding assignment
   lotteries appear to generate larger gains than other charters.},

Abstract = {We develop a theory of moral behavior, individual and collective, based
   on a general model of identity in which people care about ``who they
   are{''} and infer their own values from past choices. The model sheds
   light on many empirical puzzles inconsistent with earlier approaches.
   Identity investments respond nonmonotonically to acts or threats, and
   taboos on mere thoughts arise to protect beliefs about the
   ``priceless{''} value of certain social assets. High endowments trigger
   escalating commitment and a treadmill effect, while competing identities
   can cause dysfunctional capital destruction. Social interactions induce
   both social and antisocial norms of contribution, sustained by
   respectively shunning free riders or do-gooders.},

   individual members' motivational states of psychological empowerment and
   affective commitment. As predicted, we found that these motivational
   states are individually and jointly influenced by teams' level of
   empowering leadership and relationship conflict and that these
   motivational states mediate the relationships between team stimuli and
   team members' innovative and teamwork behaviors and turnover intentions.
   In addition, results held despite controlling for team members'
   nationality and collectivism. We discuss contributions of our study to
   the team motivation, conflict, and stress literatures.},

Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {In the 2000s, the African economy finally began to stir. Africa is today
   the world's third-fastest growing region, and its collective GDP is
   equal to Brazil's and Russia's. Africans spend nearly \$900 billion on
   goods and services--far more than Indians do. Pent-up consumer demand on
   the continent is enormous, and so are the opportunities: Consider that
   telecom companies have added 316 million subscribers more than the U.S.
   population in Africa since 2000.
   Yet because of political instability and poverty, many companies have
   reservations about Africa. To help managers assess whether growth will
   continue there-and if so, where-McKinsey conducted an economic analysis
   of the continent and studied its consumer markets. The conclusion:
   Companies can no longer ignore Africa. But they need to manage risks,
   develop innovative strategies to deal with gaps in infrastructure and
   training, and recognize that it isn't one market. There are four main
   types of economies: diversified, oil exporting, transition, and
   pretransition. Each presents a different set of opportunities and
   challenges, and executives must develop their strategies accordingly.},

Abstract = {The human psyche is equipped with the capacity to solve problems using
   different mental states or mindsets. Different mindsets can lead to
   different judgment and decision making styles, each associated with its
   own perspective and biases. To change perspective, people can, and often
   do, switch mindsets. We argue, however,. that mindset switching can be
   costly for subsequent decisions. We propose that mindset switching is an
   executive function that relies on the same psychological resource that
   governs other acts of executive functioning, including self-regulation.
   This implies that there are psychic COSTS to switching mindsets that are
   borne out in depleted executive resources. One implication of this
   framework is that switching mindsets should render people more likely to
   fail at subsequent self-regulation than they would if maintaining a
   consistent mindset. The findings from experiments that manipulated
   mindset switching in five domains support this model. (C) 2010 Elsevier

Abstract = {We report the results of a survey of key thought leaders within the

   Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice editorial board whether they
   consider franchisors to be entrepreneurs, whether they consider
   franchisees to be entrepreneurs, whether they consider research on
   franchising to be entrepreneurship research, and how they view the
   quality of franchising research compared with the quality of
   entrepreneurship research in general. Their collective responses offer
   important implications for franchising research. One implication is that
   franchising research needs to become more theoretically robust. A second
   is that the concepts of opportunity recognition, risk, organizational
   size, stage of organizational development, and organizational autonomy
   need to be taken into account when studying franchising.},

Abstract = {Organizations in an emerging organizational population face an identity
   problem. Collectively, organizations cannot yet rely on a coherent and
   stable definition of what membership in that new industry means.
   Individually, each organization must also establish its own distinctive
   identity to differentiate itself from competitors and secure resources.
   To explore the relationship between differentiation and the
   consolidation of recognizable identity element clusters, we examine the
   emergence of organizational form in the early years of the Arizona
   charter school industry. This industry is particularly interesting for
   scholars studying institutional processes because the legislative
   mandate of the new industry was for schools to experiment and provide
   education in an unconventional manner. Thus, the legislative definition
   of the organizational form or template for the charter school identity
   was intentionally underspecified. Using inductive analysis and
   regression models, we examine the process of identity realization
   occurring among charter schools and assess how the local institutional
   context of charter schools affected the realization process. The
   analyses demonstrate that new industries may come to be characterized by
   multiple element clusters; a single label for an organizational form may
   be linked to different combinations of identity elements. Our results
   also demonstrate that identity realization at the organizational level
   occurs through mimicry and differentiation processes and is facilitated
   by the local institutional context. In particular, the diversity of
   organizational resources available to industry entrepreneurs enables
   identity differentiation from one's peers.},

Abstract = {We investigate whether the adverse effects of investors' behavioral
   biases extend beyond the domain of financial markets to the broad
   macro-economy. Focusing on the income risk-sharing role of financial
   markets, we find that risk sharing is higher (more than double) in U.S.
   states where investors are more sophisticated and exhibit weaker
   behavioral biases. The potential for risk sharing varies geographically,
   but states with better risk-sharing opportunities are able to achieve
   higher levels of risk sharing only when investors in those states are
   more sophisticated. Collectively, these results indicate that investors'
   aggregate behavioral biases and their lack of financial sophistication
   adversely affect the local macro-economy.},

Title = {How medical practice evolves: Learning to treat failing hearts with an
   implantable device},
Journal = {RESEARCH POLICY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {40},
Number = {4},
Pages = {511-525},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {In this article we propose that medical practice evolves as a result of
   progress along three different pathways: improvement in the ability to
   develop effective medical technologies, learning in medical practice,
   and advances in biomedical scientific understanding of disease. The
   relative importance of these three pathways varies from case to case,
   and often they interact strongly. More specifically, we argue here that
   in cases of therapeutic innovation where a new medical technology is
   involved the advance in medical practice is driven largely by the
   ability to develop and use effective medical artifacts and the
   interactive sequence among these interdependent pathways often starts
   with what is learned in practice and not in science. While we state this
   argument in general, we develop it in detail in a longitudinal and
   contextual case study of the emergence and evolution of a treatment for
   advanced heart failure based on an implantable device, the Left
   Ventricular Assist Device (LVAD). Our findings show that an essential
   aspect of the evolution of the LVAD therapy is collective and cumulative
   learning that requires experience that only can be gained through the
   actual use of LVADs. We discuss the theoretical and policy implications
   that follow from our understanding of how medical practice evolves for
   research on the evolution of medical practices and new medical
   technologies, and policies about the evaluation of rapidly moving
   medical practices and clinical research involved in their advancement.

Abstract = {The current study draws on motivated information processing in groups

   Three-person teams performed a city management decision-making
   simulation (N = 74 teams; 222 individuals). Teams first managed a
   simulated city that was newly formed and required growth strategies and
   were then abruptly switched to a second simulated city that was
   established and required revitalization strategies. Consistent with
   hypotheses, external sensegiving and team composition enabled distinct
   aspects of collective information processing. Sensegiving prompted the
   emergence of team strategy mental models (i.e., cognitive information
   processing); psychological collectivism facilitated information sharing
   (i.e., behavioral information processing); and cognitive ability
   provided the capacity for both the cognitive and behavioral aspects of
   collective information processing. In turn, team mental models and
   information sharing enabled reactive strategy adaptation.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF APPLIED PSYCHOLOGY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {96},
Number = {3},
Pages = {574-587},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {New leaders face a challenging task when they take charge of their
   teams. They have to determine how best to guide the work process, and
   they must understand how their behaviors will affect the members of
   their team. This research examines how a newly assigned team leader's
   status moderates subordinates' reactions to different leadership styles
   to affect assessments of the leader's self-confidence and effectiveness,
   and how this impacts team performance. Across 2 experimental studies,
   results demonstrate that low-status leaders are rated as more effective
   when they use a directive style, whereas high-status leaders are viewed
   as more effective when they use a participative style, and this
   relationship is mediated by perceptions of self-confidence. In addition,
   teams whose leaders are viewed more favorably perform better on a
   complex group task. These findings imply that low-status individuals are
   able to enhance their level of personal power by drawing on whatever
   positional power they hold, whereas high-status individuals are better
   off relying solely on their personal power to influence others. This
   research also provides a clear demonstration that assessments of new
   leaders' behaviors are subject to an appraisal that is clouded by
   observers' status perceptions and attributions.},

Abstract = {Drawing on social identity theory, we examine how Whites' race-related
   beliefs drive their reactions to race-based Affirmative Action Policies
   (AAPs). Across laboratory and field settings, we find that Whites with
   relatively high modern racism (MR) or collective relative deprivation
   (CRD) beliefs perceive greater White disadvantage in organizations that
   have race-based AAPs, than in organizations that do not. Alternatively,
   race-based AAPs do not lead to perceptions of White disadvantage among
   Whites with relatively low MR and CRD beliefs. We also find that White
   disadvantage mediates the relationship between the combined effects of
   race-based AAPs, MR beliefs, and CRD beliefs and the perceived fairness
   of the organization's selection and promotion policies. Our findings
   suggest that race-based AAPs do not necessarily lead to perceptions of
   White disadvantage, but are contingent upon the interpretive lens of
   Whites' MR and CRD beliefs, and also offer practical insights for
   preventing negative reactions to race-based AAPs. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

Abstract = {We examine the roles of social accounts in influencing lenders'
   decisions about loaning money to borrowers. Using field data and a
   laboratory experiment, we show that lenders will lend money depending on
   the accounts borrowers tell. In Study 1, field data from a peer-to-peer
   lending website reveal that two-account combinations
   (explanation-acknowledgment and explanation-denial) increase the
   likelihood of favorable lending decisions. A laboratory study helps
   explain the important role of accounts by unpacking the process of
   perceived borrower trustworthiness in lending decisions. A final field
   study assessing the performance of loans 2 years after origination shows
   that accounts, despite having a positive effect on the loan decision
   process, negatively predict loan performance. Collectively, the three
   studies show that accounts facilitate economic exchanges between
   unacquainted transaction partners because of their role in increasing
   perceived trustworthiness, but that ironically, accounts can negatively
   relate to loan performance. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Extending the dialogue on corporate social performance (CSP) as
   descriptive stakeholder management (Clarkson, Acad Manage Rev 20:92,
   1995), we examine differences in CSP activity between family and
   nonfamily firms. We argue that CSP activity can be explained by the
   firm's identity orientation toward stakeholders (Brickson, Admin Sci
   Quart 50:576, 2005; Acad Manage Rev 32:864, 2007). Specifically,
   individualistic, relational, or collectivistic identity orientations can
   describe a firm's level of CSP activity toward certain stakeholders.
   Family firms, we suggest, adopt a more relational orientation toward
   their stakeholders than nonfamily firms, and thus engage in higher
   levels of CSP. Further, we invoke collectivistic identity orientation to
   argue that the higher the level of family or founder involvement within
   a family firm, the greater the level of CSP toward specific
   stakeholders. Using social performance rating data from 1991 to 2005, we
   find that family and nonfamily firms demonstrate notable differences in
   terms of social initiatives and social concerns. We also find that the
   level of family and founder involvement is related to the type and
   frequency of a family firm's social initiatives and social concerns.},

Abstract = {This paper examines moral hazard in teams over time. Agents are
   collectively engaged in a project whose duration and outcome are
   uncertain, and their individual efforts are unobserved. Free-riding
   leads not only to a reduction in effort, but also to procrastination.
   Collaboration among agents dwindles over time, but does not cease as
   long as the project has not succeeded. In addition, the delay until the
   project succeeds, if it ever does, increases with the number of agents.
   We show why deadlines, but not necessarily better monitoring, help to
   mitigate moral hazard. (JEL D81, D82, D83)},

Abstract = {This paper examines the Individualism-Collectivism (I-C) dimension of
   national culture in the Hofstede and GLOBE models. We identify major
   contradictions between the two culture models, which result in
   contradictory relationships with external variables such as economic
   prosperity. We critically evaluate the content validity of the items
   used to measure this construct in both models. Based on our analysis, we
   suggest that Hofstede's Individualism-Collectivism index be relabelled
   as Self-orientation vs Work-orientation and GLOBE's In-group
   collectivism as Family Collectivism. We demonstrate how the proposed
   alternative conceptualizations of the Individualism-Collectivism
   dimensions in both the Hofstede and GLOBE models can help reconcile the
   anomalous relationships between these two models of national culture,
   and between their dimension scores and other external variables of
   interest to researchers. We recommend a way forward for future research
   incorporating the collectivism dimensions that identifies which of the
   Hofstede/GLOBE scores is appropriate for differing purposes. This will
   help to make future research findings clearer, and to reduce
   contradictions and anomalies. Implications drawn from such research
   should also be clearer as a result. Journal of International Business

Title = {Coordination modes in public funding systems},
Journal = {RESEARCH POLICY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {40},
Number = {3},
Pages = {355-367},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {The aim of this paper is to look at public research funding systems from
   the perspective of their broader institutional arrangements, in order to
   observe how these shape the relationships between funding agencies and
   research actors. Accordingly, public funding is considered as a
   multilevel and multiactor system, where stable patterns are largely
   generated by the collective interaction among actors (beyond formal
   rules and structures) and where coordination between actors (especially
   funding agencies and performers) represents a key for the functionality
   of the systems. This drives to characterise the main organisational
   forms of public research funding in terms of their underlying
   coordination mode and to use this framework to evaluate them against a
   number of criteria. Further, the way how these organisational forms can
   be combined to yield national-level configurations is discussed, and
   some of their properties and conditions of functioning are derived from
   the previous discussion; this also leads to identification of three main
   configurations of funding systems the project-based model, the mixed
   model, the vertically integrated model which describe the variety of
   national systems and, to a large extent, underpin current discussion on
   European research policy. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {This article provides an assessment of the impact of Union Learning
   Representatives (ULRs) on both employer-funded and non-employer funded
   training in Britain. The findings, based upon the largest and most
   comprehensive national survey of ULRs conducted to date, suggest that
   while a significant proportion of ULRs have influenced training levels
   positively, a further 26 percent have had no positive impact on either
   employer-funded or non-employer funded training, and a further 13
   percent have had a very limited impact. The article also develops an
   `Activity-Support-Characteristics' (ASC) framework, and uses this
   framework to identify the factors that are associated with the ability
   of ULRs to influence training levels. The analysis shows ULRs are more
   likely to have had a positive impact on training where: they spend five
   hours a week or more on the role; they are supported by a workplace
   Learning Centre or a Union Learning Fund project; managers value their
   ULR activities; consultation or negotiation over training occurs; or the
   ULR represents no more than 200 employees.},

   was negatively related to initial team performance. Goal Priority was a
   strong predictor of end-state performance. Team-member exchange
   moderated the relationship between performance change and 3 of the 5

Abstract = {When companies fail to account for collective and relational goals in
   customer solutions, a mismatch can occur between firms' solutions and
   those that customers envision. Understanding the integration processes
   of customer networks is essential to improving solution design. This
   investigation draws on depth interviews with 21 families, the focal
   customer network, to generate collective and relational vacation
   narratives that contextualize their accounts. The authors identify four
   customer network integration processes: offerings assembled around
   prioritized goals, alternate participation, concurrent participation,
   and offerings assembled around separate coalitions. The findings reveal
   that the resulting mix of integrated products and services, or the
   solution, is shaped by customer network identity goals, goal management
   approaches, and constraints. The authors conclude with recommendations
   for how firms can use this information to improve solution design,
   identify new network partners, and revise value propositions.},

Abstract = {Virtue-based research in business ethics has increased over the last two
   decades, but most of the research has focused on the actions of an
   individual person. In this article, we examine the associations among
   team-level virtues using data from two studies. Specifically, we
   investigate whether transparency (usually thought to be an
   organizational- or collective-level construct), behavioral integrity
   (usually thought to be an individual-level construct), and trust
   (usually thought to be an individual-level construct) can be
   conceptualized and operate at the team level of analysis and, if so,
   what their relationships are to team performance. Using Partial Least
   Squares (PLS) analysis, we found in both studies that team transparency
   was positively related to team behavioral integrity, which in turn was
   positively related to team trust. We also found evidence of a positive
   relationship between team trust and team performance. Implications of
   these findings for future teams and ethics research are discussed.},

Abstract = {The public increasingly holds firms accountable for social and
   environmental outcomes, such as product toxicity problems and human
   rights violations, throughout their global supply chains. How can
   companies improve the social and environmental performance within their
   supply chains, particularly as other competitive pressures, such as cost
   and quality, continue to escalate? Starting from an efficient versus
   responsive supply chain framework, we develop an integrative model that
   blends together elements of supply chain configuration, stakeholder
   management, and capability development. Specifically, we spotlight the
   dimensions of control and accountability that collectively determine
   stakeholder exposure, and show how this new construct affects the
   linkages between supply chain capabilities, configuration, and
   performance. In particular, this analysis reveals that the nature of
   stakeholder exposure determines how social/environmental technical and
   relational capabilities impact social and environmental outcomes. We
   conclude with implications for research and practice, discussing how
   current supply chain theories must be extended to incorporate external
   stakeholders, to clarify strategies and identify potential pitfalls, and
   to better predict performance outcomes. Published by Elsevier B.V.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this study was to uncover compositional and emergent
   influences on unethical behavior by teams. Results from 126 teams
   indicated that the presence of a formalistic orientation within the team
   was negatively related to collective unethical decisions. Conversely,
   the presence of a utilitarian orientation within the team was positively
   related to both unethical decisions and behaviors. Results also
   indicated that the relationship between utilitarianism and unethical
   outcomes was moderated by the level of psychological safety within the
   team, such that teams with high levels of safety were more likely to
   engage in unethical behaviors. Implications are discussed, as well as
   potential directions for future research.},

   (1) At the empirical/methodological level, this study attempts to
   simultaneously analyze the three Lefebvrian spaces in a single
   organization, demonstrating negotiations and struggles over
   interpretations of OA. (2) We analyze aesthetic jamming as a form of
   intentional and unintentional efforts at collective resistance that not
   only reveals the aesthetic mechanisms of regulation, but actually uses
   them as a method of counter-regulation. (3) Whereas most studies in this
   emerging body of literature focus on the regulation of
   organization-based identities (bureaucratic and professional), we show
   how the translation of extraorganizational hierarchies of identities
   (national, ethnic, and gendered) into the organizational control system
   is also mediated by OA.},

   Entrepreneurship},
Journal = {ORGANIZATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {22},
Number = {2},
Pages = {449-463},
Month = {MAR-APR},
Abstract = {The concept of collective identity has gained prominence within
   organizational theory as researchers have studied how it consequentially
   shapes organizational behavior. However, much less attention has been
   paid to the question of how nascent collective identities become
   legitimated. Although it is conventionally argued that membership
   expansion leads to collective identity legitimacy, we draw on the notion
   of cultural entrepreneurship to argue that the relationship is more
   complex and is culturally mediated by the stories told by group members.
   We propose a theoretical framework about the conditions under which the
   collective identity of a nascent entrepreneurial group is more likely to
   be legitimated. Specifically, we posit that legitimacy is more likely to
   be achieved when members articulate a clear defining collective identity
   story that identifies the group's orienting purpose and core practices.
   Although membership expansion can undermine legitimation by introducing
   discrepant actors and practices to a collective identity, this potential
   downside is mitigated by growth stories, which help to coordinate
   expansion. Finally, we theorize how processes associated with collective
   identity membership expansion might affect the evolution of defining
   collective identity stories.},

Journal = {ACCOUNTING ORGANIZATIONS AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {36},
Number = {2},
Pages = {63-85},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Recent research has shown that management control systems (MCS) can
   improve performance in contexts characterized by high levels of task
   uncertainty. This seems to conflict with a second stream of research,
   which argues that MCSs risk undermining the intrinsic motivation needed
   for effective performance in such settings. To solve this puzzle, we
   build on theories of perceived locus of causality and self-construal and
   develop an integrative model summarized in 15 propositions. To explicate
   our proposed solution and to show its robustness, we focus on the class
   of activities we call large-scale collaborative creativity (LSCC) -
   contexts where individuals face a dual challenge of demonstrating
   creativity and embracing the formal controls that coordinate their
   creative activities with others'. We argue that LSCC requires the
   simultaneous activation of intrinsic and identified forms of motivation,
   and simultaneously independent and interdependent self-construals.
   Against some scholarship that argues or assumes that such simultaneous
   combinations are infeasible, we argue that they can be fostered through
   appropriate attraction-selection-attrition policies and management
   control systems design. We also show how our propositions can enrich our
   understanding of motivation in other settings, where creativity and/or
   coordination demands are less pressing. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {It is instructive to read the article that Katharine Coman published in
   the first issue of the American Economic Review to gain insight into the
   problems of collective action related to irrigation in the American
   West. One gains further understanding of the problems Coman identifies
   by using a social-ecological system (Ostrom 2007, 2009) to organize the
   diverse variables identified by Coman. One gains a general lesson from
   this analysis that changing the formal governance structure of
   irrigation is not sufficient to ensure efficient investment in
   facilities or that farmers are able to acquire property and make a
   reasonable living. Building knowledge and trust are, however, essential
   for solving collective-action problems. (JEL B31, N51, Q15, Q25)},

Volume = {37},
Number = {5},

Abstract = {We introduce the concept of an underdog brand biography to describe an
   emerging trend in branding in which firms author a historical account of
   their humble origins, lack of resources, and determined struggle against
   the odds. We identify two essential dimensions of an underdog biography:
   external disadvantage, and passion and determination. We demonstrate
   that such a biography can increase purchase intentions, real choice, and
   brand loyalty. We argue that these biographies are effective because
   consumers react positively when they see the underdog aspects of their
   own lives being reflected in branded products. Four studies demonstrate
   that the underdog brand biography effect is driven by identity
   mechanisms: we show that the effect is (a) mediated by consumers'
   identification with the brand, (b) greater for consumers who strongly
   self-identify as underdogs, (c) stronger when consumers are purchasing
   for themselves versus for others, and (d) stronger in cultures in which
   underdog narratives are part of the national identity.},

   of individuals faced with a collective choice from a set of
   alternatives. A key message from our results is that the set of optimal
   decision rules is well defined, particularly simple, and well known: the
   class of scoring rules. We provide the optimal scoring rules for the
   three different ideals of justice under consideration: utilitarianism
   (efficiency), maximin, and maximax. The optimal utilitarian scoring rule
   depends crucially on the probability distribution of the utilities. The
   optimal maximin (respectively maximax) scoring rule takes the optimal
   utilitarian scoring rule and applies a factor that shifts it towards
   negative voting (respectively plurality voting).},

Volume = {35},

Abstract = {The financial rewards and consequences of entrepreneurship for the
   individual are unknown. Prior studies have focused on self-employment
   income estimates and have highlighted the low median earnings that may
   be anticipated. The apparent financial irrationality of entrepreneurship
   is typically explained in terms of nonpecuniary compensating factors,
   such as autonomy and satisfaction. However, the financial rewards of
   entrepreneurship are multifaceted and include different types and
   amounts of rewards at different stages of the business life cycle. More
   accurate reflections of entrepreneurial rewards require researchers to
   move away from the use of narrow and static measures and instead focus
   on a broad set of indicators that collectively contribute to overall
   economic well-being. Entrepreneurial rewards are not only determined by
   business rationality, but are influenced by household needs that evolve
   over time. Hence, the analysis of entrepreneurial rewards requires an
   approach that captures the processes of reward decision making over the
   business life cycle while contextualizing reward decisions within the
   entrepreneurial household.},

Abstract = {We present a revealed preference methodology for empirically analysing
   collective consumption behaviour. First, we introduce an integer
   programming (IP) methodology for testing data consistency with
   collective consumption models that account for publicly as well as
   privately consumed goods. This IP methodology can include information on
   ``assignable quantities{''} for private goods. Next, we show that the IP
   methodology allows for recovering the personalized (Lindahl) prices for
   the public goods and the personalized quantities for the private goods.
   In turn, this implies recovery of the sharing rule (i.e. personalized
   income share levels). An empirical application demonstrates the
   practical usefulness of the methodology.},

Abstract = {The role of responsible leadership-for each leader and as part of a
   leader's collective actions-is essential to global competitive success
   (Doh and Stumpf, Handbook on responsible leadership and governance in
   global business, 2005; Maak and Pless, Responsible leadership, 2006a.
   Failures in leadership have stimulated interest in understanding
   ``responsible leadership'' by researchers and practitioners. Research on
   responsible leadership draws on stakeholder theory, with employees
   viewed as a primary stakeholder for the responsible organization
   (Donaldson and Preston, Acad Manag Rev 20(1):65-91, 1995; Freeman,
   Strategic management:a stakeholder approach, 1984; Mitchell et al., Acad
   Manag Rev 22:853-886, 1997; Phillips and Freeman, Stakeholder theory and
   organizational ethics, 2003. We define and operationalize responsible
   leadership from the perspective of employees and their views of the
   actions of their leaders. Drawing on a comprehensive survey of 28 Indian
   and global organizations operating in India, we report the results from
   4,352 employees on the relationship between responsible leadership,
   their pride in and satisfaction with their organization, and retention 1
   year later. Strong associations were found among these variables
   suggesting that responsible leadership-employee perceptions of the
   support they receive from managers, the HR practices, and corporate
   socially responsible actions-may be an overarching construct that
   connects them to the organization.},

Abstract = {Bridging the literature of procedural justice, social identification,
   and voice, we present a conceptual model of observers' voice responses
   to injustices perpetrated on coworkers. Based on social identity theory,
   we contend that similarity to the target of injustice influences
   observer identification with the target, as moderated by the observer's
   scope of justice, which then influences the observer's perceptions of
   injustice and decision to express voice. Additionally, we posit that the
   link between observers' perceptions of injustice and expressed voice is
   moderated by the observer's perceived opportunity to express voice.
   Finally, we propose that the decision to express voice individually or
   collectively depends on the justice climate along with the costs and
   benefits associated with each option. Theoretical and managerial
   implications are discussed. (C) 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

Abstract = {Studies of the causes and consequences of turnover at the group, unit,

   Indicative of its importance, turnover rate research spans numerous

   broader measures of organizational effectiveness (productivity, customer
   outcomes, firm performance) as well as by the related perspective that
   collective turnover is an important outcome in its own right. The goal
   of this review is to critically examine and extract meaningful insights
   from research on the causes and consequences of group, unit, and
   organizational turnover. The review is organized around five major
   ``considerations,{''} including (1) measurement and levels of analysis
   issues, (2) consequences, (3) curvilinear and interaction effects, (4)
   methodological and conceptual issues, and (5) antecedents. The review

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The consumption literature uses adult equivalence scales to measure
   individual-level inequality. This practice imposes the assumption that
   there is no within-household inequality. In this paper, we show that
   ignoring consumption inequality within households produces misleading
   estimates of inequality along two dimensions. To illustrate this point,
   we use a collective model of household behaviour to estimate consumption
   inequality in the U.K. from 1968 to 2001. First, the use of adult
   equivalence scales underestimates the initial level of cross-sectional
   consumption inequality by 50\%, as large differences in the earnings of
   husbands and wives translate into large differences in consumption
   allocations within households. Second, we estimate the rise in
   between-household inequality has been accompanied by an offsetting
   reduction in within-household inequality. Our findings also indicate
   that increases in marital sorting on wages and hours worked can
   simultaneously explain two-thirds of the decline in withinhousehold
   inequality and between a quarter and one-half of the rise in
   between-household inequality for one and two adult households.},

Year = {2011},
Volume = {22},
Number = {1},

Month = {JAN-FEB},
Abstract = {This grounded theory-building multiple-case study examines the executive
   leadership group that comprises the general manager (GM) that heads each
   of the firm's business units in a multibusiness organization. Because
   each GM exercises control and authority over their business unit's
   resources, they operate at the nexus of firm-level strategy and strategy
   implementation through the development of business-unit-level strategy
   and tactics. Moreover, they play an essential role in adapting the
   organization by collectively sensing, seizing, and reconfiguring
   resources and thereby capturing product-market opportunities that
   emerge. However, there is little direct empirical understanding of this
   important executive leadership group. This study begins to address this
   gap in the literature by exploring the relationship between the
   characteristics of the set of business-unit general managers and firm
   performance in six firms operating in the high-dynamic software industry
   with an in-depth comparative case study. New theory is developed that
   begins to open the ``black box{''} of executive leadership groups, and
   in so doing contributes new understanding of executive leadership groups
   and dynamic managerial capabilities, and thereby introduces the notion
   of an episodic team.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF APPLIED PSYCHOLOGY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {96},
Number = {1},
Pages = {183-191},

Abstract = {Despite a growing body of research on employee voice defined as the
   discretionary communication of ideas, suggestions, or opinions intended
   to improve organizational or unit functioning the effects of shared or
   collective-level cognitions have received scant attention. There has
   also been relatively little research on voice within work groups. Our
   goal in this study was to address these important gaps by focusing on
   the effects of group-level beliefs about voice (i.e., group voice
   climate) on individual voice behavior within work groups. We conducted a
   cross-level investigation of voice behavior within 42 groups of
   engineers from a large chemical company. Consistent with our hypotheses,
   group voice climate was highly predictive of voice and explained
   variance beyond the effects of individual-level identification and
   satisfaction, and procedural justice climate. Also consistent with
   predictions, the effect of identification on voice was stronger in
   groups with favorable voice climates. These findings provide evidence
   that voice is shaped not just by individual attitudes and perceptions of
   the work context, as past research has shown, but also by group-level
   beliefs. The results also highlight the importance of broadening our
   conceptual models of voice to include shared cognitions and of
   conducting additional cross-level research on voice.},

Abstract = {This research analyzes how foreign organizational practices diffuse
   among indigenous enterprises in a developing economy. It highlights the
   collective knowledge-building process as central for understanding
   diffusion. Based on a longitudinal case study of a cluster of dairy
   producers in Nicaragua, a representative low-income country, it looks at
   cross-border diffusion in conditions that differ significantly from
   advanced economies. The current literature that highlights institutional
   pressures driving global spread of practices has limits for capturing a
   significant dynamic caused by increased integration of markets and
   production. By focusing on production organization and practices in a
   late developing context, this paper explains the intertwined process of
   spreading new standards and changing existing local practices by
   elaborating the relationship among building collective capabilities,
   learning, and standards diffusion. This study enriches current views on
   institutional effects and adds to the practice-based literature, as well
   as to the work on developing economy firms in organizational research.},

Abstract = {Mortality has not been given the attention it deserves within
   organization studies. Even when it has been considered, it is not
   usually in terms of its implications for own lives and ethical choices.
   In particular, Heidegger's writing on death has been almost entirely
   ignored both in writing on death and writing on organizational ethics,
   despite his insights into how our mortality and the ethics of existence
   are linked. In this paper, we seek to address this omission by arguing
   that a consideration of death may yield important insights about the
   ethics of organizational life. Most important of these is that a
   Heideggerian approach to death brings us up against fundamental ethical
   questions such as what our lives are for, how they should be lived and
   how we relate to others. Heideggerarian thought also reconnects ethics
   and politics, as it is closely concerned with how we can collectively
   make institutions that support our life projects rather than thwart or
   diminish them.},

Title = {The impact of internal integration and relationship commitment on
   external integration},

Volume = {29},
Number = {1-2, SI},
Pages = {17-32},

Abstract = {Supply chain integration (SCI) among internal functions within a
   company, and external trading partners within a supply chain, has
   received increasing attention from academicians and practitioners in
   recent years. SCI consists of internal integration of different
   functions within a company and external integration with trading
   partners. While both supply chain internal and external integration have
   been studied extensively, our understanding of what influences SCI and
   the relationship between internal and external integration is still very
   limited. This paper argues that external integration with customers and
   suppliers is simultaneously influenced by internal integration and
   relationship commitment to customers and suppliers. Internal integration
   enables external integration because organizations must first develop
   internal integration capabilities through system-, data-, and
   process-integration, before they can engage in meaningful external
   integration. At the same time, before external integration can be
   successfully implemented, organizations must have a willingness to
   integrate with external supply chain partners, which is demonstrated by
   their relationship commitment.
   We propose and test a model that specifies the relationship between
   internal integration, relationship commitment, and external integration,
   using data collected from manufacturing firms in China. The results show
   that internal integration and relationship commitment improve external
   integration independently, and their interactive effect on external
   integration is not significant. However, internal integration has a much
   greater impact on external integration than relationship commitment.
   We also examine the model for companies with different ownerships, and
   the results indicate that for Chinese controlled companies where there
   is a strong collectivism culture and more reliance on ``Guanxi{''}
   (relationship), relationship commitment has a significant impact on
   external integration with suppliers and customers. This is in stark
   contrast to foreign controlled companies, characterized by a more
   individualistic culture and more reliance on technological capabilities,
   where no significant relationship between relationship commitment and
   external integration could be found. The model is also tested across
   different industries and different regions in China, providing useful
   insights for Chinese companies in particular. This study makes
   significant contributions to the SCI literature by simultaneously
   studying the effects of internal integration and relationship commitment
   on external integration, and providing several future research
   directions. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

   Employing the case of semi-permanent work patterns prevalent in creative

   network members. Transformations in patterns of relating are linked with
   shifts in network identity and members' perceived creative potential.
   Future work could empirically test whether an optimal mix or a pattern
   of affective bonding and anti-conformist bridging could be linked to
   creative potential in semi-permanent work teams.},

Abstract = {In three studies, the authors introduce and probe the role of emotional

   refers to a person's disposition toward experiencing a preferred level
   of emotional intensity. The results from the first two studies conducted
   in the laboratory and the field collectively demonstrate that consumers
   feel greater enjoyment and enhanced liking for the marketer when there
   is a close match between their emotional receptivity and the level of
   emotional intensity displayed by the marketer. In the third study, the
   authors show that consumers' emotional receptivity can be temporarily
   increased or decreased using advertisements that depict more or less
   expressive social interaction, respectively. The findings are similar to
   those observed in the first two studies. In addition, a preliminary
   study establishes the discriminant validity of the proposed battery of
   emotional receptivity items from existing related constructs. The
   authors discuss the theoretical and managerial implication and offer

Title = {Negotiated Measurement Rules in Debt Contracts},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ACCOUNTING RESEARCH},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {48},
Number = {5},
Pages = {1103-1144},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {This paper investigates contractual definitions of net income and net
   worth and the cross-sectional variation in definitions of net income in
   a large sample of private debt contracts to shed light on the debt
   contracting demand for accounting numbers. The descriptive evidence
   indicates that removing transitory earnings is one principal concern in
   the measurement of earnings but not in the measurement of net worth. In
   the extreme, contracts are never written on comprehensive income as an
   earnings concept, whereas accumulated other comprehensive income is
   included in net worth in most contracts. In contrast, conservative
   adjustment, in the sense of including certain types of negative earnings
   but not the corresponding positive earnings, does not seem to be a
   primary consideration in measuring net income and net worth.
   Cross-sectionally, I find that net income is more likely to be defined
   differently from the GAAP when net income plays a more important role in
   a contract, when the loan maturity is longer, and when transitory
   earnings are less useful for debt contracting. Collectively, the
   evidence shows that debt contracting parties choose contracting
   variables in a manner consistent with efficient contracting, and that
   transitory earnings are relatively less useful in measuring firm
   performance for debt contracting.},

Abstract = {We study dynamic selection of governments under different political
   institutions, with a special focus on institutional ``flexibility.{''} A
   government consists of a subset of the individuals in the society. The
   competence level of the government in office determines collective
   utilities (e.g., by determining the amount and quality of public goods),
   and each individual derives additional utility from being part of the
   government (e.g., rents from holding office). We characterize the
   dynamic evolution of governments and determine the structure of stable
   governments, which arise and persist in equilibrium. In our model,
   perfect democracy, where current members of the government do not have
   veto power over changes in governments, always leads to the emergence of
   the most competent government. However, any deviation from perfect
   democracy, to any regime with incumbency veto power, destroys this
   result. There is always at least one other, less competent government
   that is also stable and can persist forever, and even the least
   competent government can persist forever in office. We also show that
   there is a nonmonotonic relationship between the degree of incumbency
   veto power and the quality of government. In contrast, in the presence
   of stochastic shocks or changes in the environment, a regime with less
   incumbency veto power has greater flexibility and greater probability
   that high-competence governments will come to power. This result
   suggests that a particular advantage of ``democratic regimes{''} (with a
   limited number of veto players) may be their greater adaptability to
   changes rather than their performance under given conditions. Finally,
   we show that ``royalty-like{''} dictatorships may be more successful
   than ``junta-like{''} dictatorships because in these regimes veto
   players are less afraid of change.},

   three distinct ``venture archetypes,{''} which typically emphasize one

   archetypes. We show how the case ventures go through interarchetype
   transitions, which are triggered by collective cognitive dissonance
   between the venture leaders' understanding of the old interpretive
   scheme and the emerging reality and are resolved through internal
   negotiations. The research provides insights into new venture evolution,
   the theory of organizational archetypes, and punctuated equilibrium

   trust of a supplier and the supplier's performance affect the buyer's
   long-term orientation toward the relationship. We propose that the
   relative effects of trust and performance on long-term orientation are
   moderated by culture - specifically the individualism/collectivism
   dimension. Hypotheses are tested on data from two individualist and two
   collectivist cultures, using responses from over 600 purchasing
   professionals in the United States, Anglo-phone Canada, Francophone
   Canada and Mexico. Taken together, empirical findings suggest that
   cultural differences warrant consideration in developing successful
   purchasing strategies. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {In this paper we use the concept of social capital to outline a
   distinctive approach to understanding the interplay between management
   control systems and the development of social connections in and between
   organisations Social capital provides a comprehensive framework for
   examining the nature of social connections through its focus on both
   structural networks (bridging) and Interpersonal relationships that
   predispose individuals towards mutually beneficial collective action
   (bonding) In doing so social capital provides a means of considering how
   individuals react to management control systems in terms of the social
   ties that exist both within the organization and external to the
   organization Using a case study of a non-government organization we show
   how social capital is implicated in efforts to attract economic capital
   and cultural capital We demonstrate how elements of a management control
   system can either enhance or inhibit the bonding and bridging dimensions
   of social capital with potential consequences on both economic and
   cultural capital We highlight the mixed and sometimes contradictory
   effects of management control systems on social capital and provide a
   powerful illustration of the role of management control systems in
   brokering alliances and bridging structural holes (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd

Volume = {47},

Abstract = {P>This study empirically investigated culture's consequences on the
   major purposes and practices of performance appraisal using a sample (n
   = 1749) drawn from the banking industry in seven countries across
   Europe, Asia, and North America. We found that the effects and
   predictive capability of assertiveness, uncertainty avoidance, in-group
   collectivism, and power distance should not be overstated nor are they
   straightforward. Organizations must be cognizant of the potential
   influence that a range of other organizational, institutional, and
   economic factors may wield on appraisal. These findings hold significant
   implications for the theoretical underpinnings of appraisal, a
   management tool largely rooted in US equity, expectancy, and procedural
   justice values and traditions. They also offer important lessons for
   practice. Not only is the transferability of appraisal and its
   operationalization affected by interactions with divergent cultures and
   contextual settings, but new hybrid appraisal architectures are emerging
   that necessitate further research.},

   Customer Help},
Journal = {ORGANIZATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {21},
Number = {6},
Pages = {1176-1194},

Abstract = {This paper investigates whether an employee's perception of customer
   wealth affects his likelihood of engaging in illegal behavior. We
   propose that envy and empathy lead employees to discriminate in
   illicitly helping customers based on customer wealth. We test for this
   hypothesis in the vehicle emissions testing market, where employees have
   the opportunity to illegally help customers by passing vehicles that
   would otherwise fail emissions tests. We find that for a significant
   number of inspectors, leniency is much higher for those customers with
   standard vehicles than for those with luxury cars, although a smaller
   group appears to favor wealthy drivers. We also investigate the
   psychological mechanisms explaining this wealth-based discriminatory
   behavior using a laboratory study. Our experiment shows that individuals
   are more willing to illegally help peers when those peers drive standard
   rather than luxury cars, and that envy and empathy mediate this effect.
   Collectively, our results suggest the presence of wealth-based
   discrimination in employee-customer relations and that envy toward
   wealthy customers and empathy toward those of similar economic status
   drive much of this illegal behavior. Implications for both theory and
   practice are discussed.},

   effectiveness},
Journal = {HUMAN RELATIONS},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {63},
Number = {11},
Pages = {1771-1806},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {We propose four theoretically competing climates that are important for
   businessunit performance: climates for external control, internal
   control, internal flexibility, and external flexibility. Using a
   sub-sample of 620 business units from multiple companies across
   different industries and countries, we identified mechanisms by which
   climates influence business performance, accounting for different
   stakeholder interests. Climate for external control related directly to
   perceived business performance; climates for external flexibility and
   internal control both related to customer loyalty, which in turn
   predicted perceived business performance. Importantly, we show the
   moderating role of context whereby climate for internal flexibility was
   positively associated with perceived business performance, but only when
   market volatility was high. Drawing on the notion of ambidexterity,
   business units with higher effectiveness measures for all stakeholders
   also had high levels of all four climates, concurrently. The study
   supports the value for organizational effectiveness of having multiple
   climates that collectively accommodate an internal-and external-focus,
   as well as control and flexibility.},

Abstract = {This paper explores the relationship between national culture and

   from prior theory that identified cognitive and motivational mechanisms

   psychological contracts were evaluated against predictions based on the
   national-level cultural values of vertical and horizontal individualism
   and collectivism in four countries. Results of interviews with 57
   participants indicated that French interviewees (vertical individualist)
   described their psychological contracts as primarily exploitive,
   Canadians (horizontal individualist) as primarily instrumental, Chinese
   (vertical collectivist) as primarily custodial and Norwegians
   (horizontal collectivist) as primarily communitarian. Exploration of the
   conditions under which patterns deviated from those predicted by the
   theory indicates potential areas for future theoretical development.},

   process that significantly affects stakeholder relations and contributes

   Indigenous identity can be both threatened and strengthened in response
   to natural gas development and is related to how individuals,
   communities and the Machiguenga (as a collective) engage in identity
   work. We also discuss broader implications for management ethics,

Abstract = {Do chief executive officers (CEOs) really matter? Do cross-sectional
   differences in firm performance and CEO pay reflect differences in CEO
   ability? Examining CEO departures over 1992-2002, we first find that the
   stock price reaction upon departure is negatively related to the firm's
   prior performance and to the CEO's prior pay. Second, the CEO's
   subsequent labor market success is greater if the firm's predeparture
   performance is better, the prior pay is higher, and the stock market's
   reaction is more negative. Finally, better prior performance, higher
   prior pay, and a more negative stock market reaction are associated with
   worse postdeparture firm performance. Collectively, these results reject
   the view that differences in firm performance stem entirely from non-CEO
   factors such as the firms' assets, other employees, or ``luck,{''} and
   that CEO pay is unrelated to the CEO's contribution to firm value.},

Abstract = {We propose that a leadership identity is coconstructed in organizations
   when individuals claim and grant leader and follower identities in their
   social interactions. Through this claiming-granting process, individuals
   internalize an identity as leader or follower, and those identities
   become relationally recognized through reciprocal role adoption and
   collectively endorsed within the organizational context. We specify the
   dynamic nature of this process, antecedents to claiming and granting,
   and an agenda for research on leadership identity and development.},

Abstract = {The dominance of agency theory can reduce our collective scope to
   analyse private equity in all its diversity and depth. We contribute to
   theorisation of private equity by developing a contrasting perspective
   that draws on a rich tradition of virtue ethics. In doing so, we
   juxtapose `private equity' with `public good' to develop points of
   rhetorical and analytical contrast. We develop a typology
   differentiating various forms of private equity, and focus on the `take
   private' form. These takeovers are where private equity funds are used
   to buy all a firm's publicly listed shares. Take private deals reduce
   reporting requirements and lessen the amount of public scrutiny a firm
   comes under. They allow greater control of a firm's assets and resources
   but also have effects in terms of the wider social fabric. The `public
   good' and virtue ethics offer an alternative basis for theorisation of
   these deals. This provides a needed contrast to accounts of private
   equity based on agency theory.},

Pages = {1294-1315},
Month = {OCT-NOV},
Abstract = {This paper compares the Uncertainty Avoidance (UA) dimension of national
   culture across the Hofstede and GLOBE models, looking at relationships
   in both data and analysis. Rather than mutual support, we detail major
   differences and anomalies across the studies. We show how these
   anomalies are resulting in contradictory explanations in research on
   national differences across a range of individual-, firm-and
   country-level phenomena. We clarify the UA measurement in both Hofstede
   and GLOBE, and find that the two models are measuring different
   components of the UA construct. We propose a two-component model of UA,
   namely, UA-stress and UA-rule orientation, and confirm its validity with
   national culture data from the Hofstede and GLOBE studies, and economic
   data from the World Bank. We also explain the negative GLOBE UA
   practices-values relationship using motivational theories. A way forward
   in future UA-related research is suggested. The Hofstede UA index, the
   GLOBE UA practices scores and the GLOBE UA values scores should be used
   within the specific domains that they represent: that is, stress, rule
   orientation practices and rule orientation aspirations, respectively.
   Resolving the contradictions in UA between and within Hofstede and GLOBE
   will help cross-cultural researchers develop more robust theories and
   more practical recommendations for international business management.

Abstract = {Consumer research has paid scant attention to public goods, especially

   meanings about the consumption of a particular public good, public
   space. Using the context of street art, we document four main ideologies
   of public space consumption that result from the interaction, both
   conflict and common intent, of urban dwellers and street artists. We
   show how public space can be contested as private and commercialized, or
   offered back as a collective good, where sense of belonging and dialogue
   restore it to a meaningful place. We demonstrate how the common nature
   of space both stimulates dialectical and dialogical exchanges across
   stakeholders and fuels forms of layered agency.},

   research supports an associative account that links PDB and impulsive
   buying as a manifestation of self-control, such that those with high PDB
   display less impulsive buying. Furthermore, this effect manifests for
   vice products but not for virtue products. The authors also find that
   restraint from temptations can occur automatically for people who have
   repeated practice (i.e., chronically high PDBs). Taken together, these
   results imply that products should be differentially positioned as vice
   or virtue products in accordance with consumers' PDBs.},

Title = {When apologies work: How matching apology components to victims'

Journal = {ORGANIZATIONAL BEHAVIOR AND HUMAN DECISION PROCESSES},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {113},
Number = {1},
Pages = {37-50},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Apologies are useful social tools that can act as catalysts in the
   resolution of conflict and inspire forgiveness. Yet as numerous
   real-world blunders attest, apologies are not always effective. Whereas
   many lead to forgiveness and reconciliation, others simply fall on deaf
   ears. Despite the fact that apologies differ in their effectiveness,
   most research has focused on apologies as dichotomous phenomena wherein
   a victim either (a) receives an apology or (b) does not. Psychological
   research has yet to elucidate which components of apologies are most
   effective, and for whom. The present research begins to address this gap
   by testing the theory that perpetrators' apologies are most likely to
   inspire victim forgiveness when their components align with victims'
   self-construals. Regression and hierarchical linear modeling analyses
   from two studies support the primary hypotheses. As predicted, victims
   reacted most positively to apologies that were congruent with their
   self-construals. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Journal = {RESEARCH POLICY},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {39},
Number = {7},
Pages = {893-906},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Incentives to innovate are a central element of innovation theory. In
   the private-investment model, innovators privately fund innovation and
   then use intellectual property protection mechanisms to appropriate
   returns from these investments. In the collective-action model, public
   subsidy funds public goods innovations, characterized by non-rivalry and
   non-exclusivity in using these innovations. Recently, these models have
   been compounded in the private-collective innovation model where
   innovators privately fund public goods innovations. Private-collective
   innovation is illustrated in the case of open source software
   development. This paper contributes to the work on this model by
   investigating incentives that motivate innovators to share their
   knowledge in an initial situation, before there is a community to
   support the innovation process. We use game theory to predict knowledge
   sharing behavior in private-collective innovation, and test these
   predictions in a laboratory setting. The results show that knowledge
   sharing is a coordination game with multiple equilibria, reflecting the
   fragility of knowledge sharing between innovators with conflicting
   interests. The experimental results demonstrate important asymmetries in
   the fragility of knowledge sharing and, in some situations, more
   knowledge sharing than theoretically predicted. A behavioral analysis
   suggests that knowledge sharing in private-collective innovation is not
   only affected by material incentives, but also by social preferences
   such as fairness. The results offer general insights into the
   relationship between incentives and knowledge sharing and contribute to
   a better understanding of the initiation of private-collective
   innovation. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Groups with a strong sense of collective efficacy set more challenging
   goals, persist in the face of difficulty, and are ultimately more likely
   to succeed than groups who do not share this belief. Given the many
   advantages that may accrue to groups who are confident, it would be
   logical to advise groups to build a high level of collective efficacy as
   early as possible. However, we draw on Whyte's (1998) theory of
   collective efficacy and groupthink, to predict that when confidence
   emerges at a high level toward the beginning of a group's existence,
   group members may be less likely to engage in process conflict; a form
   of conflict that may be beneficial in the early phase of a group
   project. We found support for this prediction in two longitudinal
   studies of classroom project teams. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {If self-interested behavior conflicts with the collective welfare, rules
   of cooperation are often installed to prevent egoistic behavior. We
   hypothesized that installing such rules may instigate personal moral
   norms of cooperation, but that they fail in doing so when installed by a
   leader who is self-interested rather than self-sacrificing. Three
   studies confirmed this and also showed that, consequently, only
   self-sacrificing leaders were able to install rules that increase
   cooperation without the need for a perfectly operating monitoring
   system.},

Abstract = {While entrepreneurial activity has been an important force for social
   and ecological sustainability; its efficacy is dependent upon the nature
   of market incentives. This limitation is sometimes explained by the
   metaphor of the prisoner's dilemma, which we term the green prison. In
   this prison, entrepreneurs are compelled to environmentally degrading
   behavior due to the divergence between individual rewards and collective
   goals for sustainable development. Entrepreneurs, however, can escape
   from the green prison by altering or creating the institutions norms,
   property rights, and legislation that establish the incentives of
   competitive games. We provide a variety of evidence of such
   entrepreneurial action and discuss its implications for theory and

Abstract = {The authors draw on resource allocation theory (Kanfer \& Ackerman,
   1989) to develop hypotheses regarding the conditions under which
   collective learning and performance orientation have interactive effects
   and the nature of those effects on teams' ability to adapt to a sudden
   and dramatic change in workload. Consistent with the theory, results of
   a laboratory study in which teams worked on a computerized,
   decision-making task over 3 performance trials revealed that learning
   and performance orientation had independent effects on team adaptability
   when teams had slack resources available for managing their changed
   task. Time helped explain the independent effects of performance
   orientation. Results also revealed that learning and performance
   orientation had interactive effects when teams did not have slack
   resources. Finally, the results of this study indicate that teams
   lacking slack resources were better able to balance high levels of
   learning and performance orientation over time with practice on the
   changed task.},

Abstract = {Although turnover is an issue of global concern, paradoxically there
   have been few studies of turnover across cultures. We investigated the
   cross-cultural generalizability of the job embeddedness model (Mitchell
   \& Lee, 2001) by examining turnover in an individualistic country
   (United States) and a collectivistic country (India). Using
   cross-cultural data from call centers (N = 797), we demonstrated that
   although organization job embeddedness predicted turnover in both
   countries, different dimensions of job embeddedness predicted turnover
   in the United States and India. As hypothesized, on the basis of
   individualism collectivism theory, person job fit was a significant
   predictor of lower turnover in the United States, whereas person
   organization fit, organization links, and community links were
   significant predictors of lower turnover in India. We also explored
   whether a newly developed construct of embeddedness-family
   embeddedness-predicts turnover above and beyond job embeddedness and
   found initial support for its utility in both the United States and
   India. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.},

Abstract = {Studies suggest that certain vowel and consonant sounds ( or phonemes)
   can be associated with perceptions of large and small size. Mental
   rehearsal of prices containing numbers with small phonemes results in
   overestimation of price discounts, whereas mental rehearsal of prices
   containing numbers with large phonemes results in underestimation.
   Mental rehearsal of the same sale prices characterized by small phonemes
   in one language and large phonemes in another language can yield
   differential effects. For example, when sale prices are rehearsed in
   English, an \$11.00 - \$7.88 (28.4\%) discount is perceived as greater
   than a \$10.00 - \$7.01 (29.9\%) discount; however, when these same
   prices are rehearsed in Chinese, the latter discount is perceived as
   greater. Non-price-related phonemes do not yield these same discount
   distortions. Collectively, findings indicate that the mere sounds of
   numbers can nonconsciously affect and distort numerical magnitude
   perceptions.},

Number = {2, SI},

Abstract = {Over the last generation, American Business Ethics has focused
   excessively on the process of managerial decision-making while ignoring
   the collective impact of these decisions and avoiding other approaches
   that might earn the disapproval of corporate executives. This narrowness
   helped the field establish itself during the 1980s, when American
   management, under pressure from finance and heightened competition, was
   unreceptive to any limitations on its autonomy. Relying, however, on
   top-down approaches inspired by Aristotle, Locke, and Kant, while
   ignoring the consequentialism of Mill and Rawls, made the field totally
   reliant upon the good will of these same corporate executives for
   generating any impact. Trends in employee compensation, finance,
   regulation, government procurement, and taxpayer subsidies suggest that
   Business Ethics has failed to significantly influence corporate
   behavior, a result that would have not surprised the realists of the
   post-war generation of Business and Society scholars. If Business Ethics
   is to prove relevant in the contemporary world, the field needs to
   acknowledge past failures and develop new approaches. The decline of
   American economic hegemony coupled to the increased internationalization
   of the discipline may create the opportunity to do so.},

Abstract = {Consumers trying to watch or restrict what they eat face a battle each
   day as they attempt to navigate the food-rich environments in which they
   live. Due to the complexity of food decision making, consumers are
   susceptible to a wide range of social, cognitive, affective, and
   environmental forces determined to interrupt their intentions to
   restrict their dietary intake. In this article, we integrate literature
   from diverse theoretical perspectives into a conceptual framework
   designed to offer a better understanding of the antecedents,
   interruptions, and consequences of dietary restraint. We outline a path
   for researchers to investigate how restraint behaviors in the eating
   domain influence a wide variety of consumer psychological phenomena. It
   is our hope that a collective examination of this literature provides a
   lens that directs future research on food decision making and dietary
   restraint and empowers consumers to invest their cognitive and
   behavioral resources towards healthy eating behaviors. (C) 2010 Society

Title = {Role Transition and the Interaction of Relational and Social Identity:
   New Nursing Roles in the English NHS},

Abstract = {Our study provides an analysis of role transition, examining how
   macro-level influences and micro-level practice interact in framing role
   transition, with a focus upon professional identity. Empirically, we
   examine the case of nurses in the English NHS, for whom government
   `modernization' policy has opened up a new occupational position in the
   delivery of genetics services within a professional bureaucracy. We
   track the experiences of the nurses through their recruitment to,
   enactment of, and progress on from, the new genetics role over two
   years. Our qualitative interview-based study encompasses six comparative
   cases. Analysis draws upon two linked literatures - role and identity,
   and sociology of professions - to examine the tension between the
   identity expected by the profession and the role expected by government
   policy-makers. While policy encourages reconfiguration of roles and
   relationships to support the new, less-bounded role, concerns aligned to
   professional identity mean that inter-professional competition between
   doctors and nurses, and intra-professional competition within nursing
   itself, constrain the enactment of the new role. Through our empirical
   study, we develop literature on role transition through its application
   to a professionalized context, and sociology of professions literature,
   within which issues of identity are relatively neglected. Our study
   demonstrates that the emphasis of identity within a professional
   bureaucracy lies at the collective level.},

Journal = {ORGANIZATION STUDIES},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {31},
Number = {7},
Pages = {873-894},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Previous research showed that short initial interaction in dyads
   accurately predicts future relation development. The paper extends these
   results from dyads to teams and demonstrates that data collected from
   short initial contacts (reciprocal relational preferences) are a sound
   basis for designing effective teams. In the approach we propose,
   potential team members have short initial contacts (popularly known as
   `speed dating') and we use the information on interpersonal evaluations
   to create teams by maximizing the number of reciprocal relational
   preferences within a team. In a sample of 76 teams (N = 378, 36
   attribute-based teams and 40 team-dating teams), we show that teams
   formed based on relational data are more effective than teams formed by
   maximizing within team diversity (gender and nationality). Team-dating
   teams show a better teamwork quality and develop more complex collective
   knowledge structures compared with attribute-based teams.},

Abstract = {Following Kuhn, this article conceptualizes social entrepreneurship as a
   field of action in a pre-paradigmatic state that currently lacks an
   established epistemology. Using approaches from neo-institutional
   theory, this research focuses on the microstructures of legitimation
   that characterize the development of social entrepreneurship in terms of
   its key actors, discourses, and emerging narrative logics. This analysis
   suggests that the dominant discourses of social entrepreneurship
   represent legitimating material for resource-rich actors in a process of
   reflexive isomorphism. Returning to Kuhn, the article concludes by
   delineating a critical role for scholarly research on social
   entrepreneurship in terms of resolving conflicting discourses within its
   future paradigmatic development.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT},

Volume = {36},
Number = {4},
Pages = {974-1010},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {This article provides a review and analysis of institutional
   entrepreneurship research with a focus on the emergence of this
   literature within two largely divergent streams: sociology-based
   institutional theory and economics-based institutional economics. The
   authors completed a review of 141 articles from these concurrent, but
   unlinked, research streams to understand how their integration might
   contribute to the further understanding of institutional
   entrepreneurship. Each stream is reviewed on its respective approaches
   to the following topics: the nature of the institutional entrepreneur,
   the types of institutions addressed, the determinants of institutional
   entrepreneurship, the mechanisms used in the process, and the empirical
   focus of each stream. The article recommends greater assimilation of the
   two streams and discusses specific opportunities for conceptual
   integration. Finally, the article offers an agenda for incorporating
   entrepreneurship research into the study of institutional
   entrepreneurship. Findings from this review suggest that while
   institutional economics focuses mostly on the antecedents and outcomes
   of institutional entrepreneurship, the institutional theory perspective
   is more concerned with the process and mechanisms that drive such
   change. The authors also suggest that entrepreneurship theory can
   greatly advance our understanding of institutional entrepreneurship by
   informing whether and how opportunities for institutional change are
   recognized, discovered, and created, as well as by providing insights on
   the antecedents and mechanisms of such activity. Most important,
   integrating the unique perspectives and domains of institutional theory,
   institutional economics, and entrepreneurship research in the study of
   institutional entrepreneurship provides substantial opportunity for
   expanding our understanding of the concept and its implications.},
